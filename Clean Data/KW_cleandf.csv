strong Kuwait has played a key role in promoting regiontoregion engagement between the EU and the GCC under the framework of the 1988 EUGCC Cooperation Agreement More recently our bilateral relations have experienced a major impetus Kuwait was the first country in the Gulf to sign a Cooperation Arrangement with the European External Action Service EEAS in July 2016 that provides a platform for regular political consultations covering common regional challenges in the Middle East and beyond The second EUKuwait meeting of Senior Officials on the implementation of the Cooperation Arrangement is set to take place on July 16 2020 under the joint leadership of Kuwait is Assistant Foreign Minister for European Affairs Ambassador Walid AlKhobaizi and the Managing Director for Middle East and North Africa of the EEAS Fernando Gentilini This meeting will be held via videoteleconference taking account of the continuation of COVID19 related travel restrictions and social distancing measures EUKuwait relations are by no means limited to official governmentlevel engagement and are deepened and enriched further by peopletopeople exchanges businesstobusiness dialogue education and parliamentary exchanges as well as cultural diplomacy The visit of a delegation from the European Parliament to Kuwait in December 2018 was hosted by the National Assembly and will we expect be reciprocated as soon as conditions permit with a return visit to Brussels by Kuwaiti parliamentarians The full resumption of contacts at all levels will of course depend on how well we manage to contain the ongoing COVID19 pandemic in the EU and in Kuwait as reopening our borders will very much depend on the success of these efforts After several very difficult weeks when the WHO designated Europe as the epicenter of the crisis the EU has by now as a whole finally managed to flatten the curve and our Member States are now carefully and gradually reopening their economies and our borders internal and external Gradual lifting The EU Member States agreed on June 30 to issue a recommendation for a partial and gradual lifting as from July 1 of the temporary restrictions on nonessential travel to the EU Schengen all EU Member States with the exception of Ireland plus the four nonEU Schengen Member States that have been in force since midMarch 2020 This recommendation features a list of just 14 countries whose residents will be permitted to enter for nonessential travel The main criteria for determining the list is public health residents of those countries that have a similar or lower rate of infection as the EU average over the last 14day period and in which the trend of new cases over a 14day period is stable or decreasing were considered for inclusion A second criterion during this first phase of the reopening is reciprocity that is does the country in question already now or will soon allow EU nationals to enter for nonessential travel While it is true that neither Kuwait nor any of the GCC members were included in this first list it is important to understand that the list will be reviewed every two weeks so that changes in the epidemiological situation based on data provided by the EU Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization complemented by qualitative information provided by EU Delegations in third countries can be taken into account for the purpose of updating the list Countries will be added whose epidemiological situation has improved and countries can be removed whose situation has deteriorated Therefore this is a first list and not a last list It is also very important to understand that the temporary restrictions introduced for nonessential travel already since midMarch and that remain in force until further notice for the vast majority of countries were neither intended nor implemented as a blanket ban EU citizens and their family members as well as longterm EU residents and their family members are exempted as are a long list of travellers with an essential function or need These travellers can be healthcare professionals frontier workers seasonal workers in agriculture transport personnel diplomats and staff of international organizations passengers in transit passengers travelling for imperative family reasons seafarers persons in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons thirdcountry nationals travelling for the purpose of study and highlyqualified thirdcountry workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed abroad Highly valued Visitors from Kuwait are indeed highly valued in Europe Considering the great economic importance of tourism to many of our EU Member States the decision to begin lifting the temporary travel restrictions to the EU in a phased and gradual manner following strict public health criteria was not taken easily As the Ambassador of the EU to Kuwait allow me to state with full sincerity that I look very much forward to the inclusion of Kuwait on the list as soon as the public health criteria are met The pandemic is a global challenge I would like to use this opportunity to commend Kuwait is response to it I believe Kuwait responded firmly to the situation and began swiftly to take measures to protect the health and safety of people living in the country The EU Delegation to Kuwait takes note of the positive daily recovery cases It is important for all of us to continue to abide by the health authorities directives The EU Delegation to Kuwait would like to express gratitude to all MoH staff front liners and volunteers that are supporting Kuwait is response to the pandemic

warning about the spread of corona infection a wide segment of expatriates especially the lowincome earners are hoping for the infection to move to their residential buildings for the rents to be slashed and landlords on the other hand are rallying behind the initiative announced by landlords of commercial complexes to reduce rents in view of the implications of the government closure order on owners of enterprises reports AlRai daily Some landlords have responded positively to repercussions of the government lockdown by waiving the rent for March as witnessed in various commercial complexes while others exempted their tenants from paying rent for two consecutive months March and April due to the financial challenges that many tenants are facing especially since payment of their salaries stopped abruptly because of the corona crisis A number of expatriates told the daily that the spread of the virus and governmental precautionary steps led to the closure of their workplaces Therefore their salaries will not be paid considering the enormous losses incurred by their employers in terms of operational returns Most of them operate under contractual agreements and legally speaking they are not entitled to privileges if the work is not completed They pointed out the corona crisis severely affected their incomes to the extent of defaulting in the payment of rent and then engaging in judicial battles with their landlords Other expatriates stressed that although the payment of their salaries did not stop during this period because they work in government agencies or large companies with the ability to absorb the economic shock their expenses increased due to the need to purchase items needed to protect themselves against the virus They affirmed that exceptional rent reduction will help them face the consequences of the crisis They pointed out some expatriates work on a daily basis and their work almost stopped asserting many will agree with them that it is difficult to pay the rent especially those sharing accommodations as they live in groups in one apartment They cannot return to their countries in order to reduce expenses due to the suspension of fl ights and they will not be able to pay rent for their apartments due to disrupted income Essa AlSabti a landlord said there is no reason to reduce rents now particularly since there is no cut in the salaries of a large number of expatriates during this period He pointed out the focus should be on helping small and medium enterprises SMEs because they are the hardest hit by this crisis He said real estate companies and real estate owners are forced to reduce or waive rents due to circumstances beyond their control in light of the government is directives and precautionary measures to control the corona pandemic He said the lease contracts do not stipulate reduction of rent in times of crisis but this step if taken will be purely based on humanitarian grounds to help tenants face repercussions of this pandemic and as societal contribution of landlords He also noted that if a tenant presents a document showing his salary has been affected the landlord is considerate enough if he decides to waive the rent due to the fact that in case of eviction the tenant will face difficulties in finding another accommodation In other words slashing or waiving the rent should not be done collectively it should be handled as individual cases AlSabti concluded Meanwhile a group of citizens appealed to landlords to take a humanitarian stand by waiving the rent of tenants whose means of livelihood halted abruptly due to the spread of coronavirus They clarified this call is inspired by the humanitarian leadership role of the State of Kuwait adopted and drawn by global humanitarian leader His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah AlAhmad AlJaber AlSabah to contribute to ongoing efforts to provide assistance to those struggling under the current conditions in the country specifically those without fixed income and those affected by the lockdown They explained the initiative is based on humanitarian grounds and that everyone is invited to adopt and support it as well as exert efforts to encourage landlords to do the same Since the coronavirus outbreak many companies and institutions have taken into account the humanitarian conditions by exempting their tenants from paying rent considering the current economic conditions CEO of the Buildings Company Walid AlShariaan confirmed the exemption of all restaurants and cafés at the Avenues Mall from paying rent for March and April in addition to 25 percent discount for owners of other commercial establishments in the mall This is in solidarity with the tenants in the mall in addition to postponing the collection of

COVID19 coronavirus yesterday AFP KUWAIT The first flight of Indians from Kuwait carrying 200 evacuees is scheduled to leave for Hyderabad on May 8 as part of the first phase of an evacuation plan chalked out by the Indian government in the wake of a global crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic In the first phase starting May 7 and spanning seven days the Indian government will fly home around 12800 distressed citizens from many countries including Gulf states on 64 flights The government has drawn a detailed plan in accordance with standard operating protocol SOP to evacuate nonresident Indians NRIs stranded abroad on compelling grounds a press release issued by the Indian government said According to the detailed flight plan prepared by the government the second flight from Kuwait will be on May 9 to Kochi and the third on May 10 to Chennai On the sixth day of evacuations passengers will be taken home to Ahmedabad while on the seventh day a special flight will leave Kuwait for Calicut Around 200 passengers will be carried on each flight taking home around 1000 people in the first phase of evacuations The evacuation probably one of the largest in recent history

Indian high commissions and embassies overseas Pregnant women senior citizens people affected with serious diseases other than COVID19 people whose visas have expired those who went abroad on visit visas and got stuck and people who are facing various hardships will be given priority It is also expected that people those who availed an amnesty offered by the Kuwait government will be able to go home now as the Indian government has decided to open its airspace to foreign carriers as part of the evacuation plan Kuwait has offered free flights and air tickets for those who availed the amnesty So we expect that their repatriation will also take place simultaneously along with the evacuation It is also our priority to evacuate those who are in deportation centers numbering over 200 We want to give equal importance to deportees serious medical cases and to those who were granted amnesty an Indian Embassy official said The Indian Embassy has opened an eregistration platform where people can fill the form and register Around 30000 people have registered with the embassy as of yesterday Although the government will arrange the means of air passage the evacuee will have to bear the travel fare creating consternation among Indian community members in Kuwait Some of them evacuees are financially very weak Many of them are seriously ill while others have lost their jobs It is not fair on the part of the Indian government to charge the travel fare from all of them The government must consider some cases at least on a merit basis said Ajithkumar Director of Kerala Pravasi Welfare Board Varghese Puthukulangara President of Overseas Indian Cultural Congress OICC Kuwait called upon the India government and various state governments to share the burden of the airfare of the hapless evacuees According to him the welfare fund kept with the Indian embassy can be used for this purpose as well People like housemaids taxi drivers daily wage earners etc are not in a position to buy their air tickets paying more than KD 200 Such people need some humanitarian consideration he pointed out India has embarked on a massive operation involving naval ships and aircraft

nation of the Seychelles was looking good 70plus straight days without a single infection Then the planes arrived Two chartered Air Seychelles flights carrying more than 200 passengers also brought the coronavirus A few tested positive Then between June 24 and 30 the countrys confirmed cases shot from 11 to 81 Now the Indian Ocean nation has delayed reopening for commercial flights for its lucrative tourism industry until Aug 1 if all goes well African nations face a difficult choice as infections are rapidly rising Welcome the international flights that originally brought COVID19 to the illprepared continent or further hurt their economies and restrict a lifeline for badly needed humanitarian aid This is a very important moment the World Health Organizations Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti told reporters on Thursday a day after Egypt reopened its airports for the first time in more than three months Other countries are preparing to follow Thats even as Africa had more than 463000 confirmed virus cases as of Sunday and South Africa its most developed economy already struggles to care for COVID19 patients But Africas economies are sick too its officials say The continent faces its first recession in a quartercentury and has lost nearly 55 billion in the travel and tourism sectors in the past three months the African Union says Airlines alone have lost about 8 billion and some might not survive Most of Africas 54 countries closed their airspace to ward off the pandemic That bought time to prepare but it also hurt efforts to deliver lifesaving medical supplies such as vaccines against other diseases Shipments of personal protective gear and coronavirus testing materials both in short supply have been delayed Many governments have decided travel needs to resume the WHOs Africa chief said Africa has seen far fewer flights than other regions during the pandemic Sometimes the entire West and Central African region saw just a single daily departure according to International Civil Aviation Organization data While Asia Europe and North America averaged several hundred departures a day from international airports the African continent averaged a couple or few score daily Last week the number of global flights jumped significantly In the threeday period between June 30 and July 2 the daily number of departures increased from 3960 to 6508 as countries loosened restrictions the data show African nations want to join the crowd Senegals president has said international flights will begin on July 15 The 15member Economic Community of West African States is expected to reopen its airspace on July 21 Nigeria has said domestic flights resume on July 8 and Rwanda on Aug 1 Kenya Airways wants to resume international flights South Africa and Somalia are open for domestic ones and Cameroon Equatorial Guinea Tanzania and Zambia now have commercial flights Tanzania opened its skies weeks ago hoping for a tourism boost despite widespread concern its hiding the extent of infections It hasnt updated case numbers since April Its good to be back Africas largest carrier Ethiopian Airlines declared late last month After scrambling to revamp its services for cargo and repatriation flights in the past few months it now wants to play a leading a role in the new normal That means face masks are mandatory on board But the WHOs Africa chief hopes to see all airlines do more Physical distancing should be encouraged by leaving seats vacant Moeti said And she suggested that when we see a flareup that is unacceptable in virus cases the loosening of travel restrictions could be reversed The WHO recommends that countries look at whether the need to fight widespread virus transmission outweighs the economic benefits of opening borders It is also crucial to determine whether the health system can cope with a spike in imported cases it says Regional leaders of the International Air Transport Association and Airports Council International are ready to go In an open letter to African ministers last month they welcomed global guidelines developed by the ICAO for the return to travel after the aviation industrys biggest challenge of its history They also urged African countries to identify every opportunity where travel restrictions could be lifted as soon as the epidemiological situation allows for it As the continent slowly takes flight some European nations and others are limiting entry to people from countries they feel are doing a good job of containing the virus African nations can seize the moment and do more tourism at home Amani AbouZeid AU commissioner for infrastructure and energy told reporters last week This is an opportunity to encourage Africans to see Africa she said Not always The 70

affected thousands of people in Kuwait so various organizations groups and even individuals have taken the initiative of finding different ways to help people in need Living Aid Kuwait is a humanitarian charitable project based on bringing together families in need and people desiring to help them by sponsoring them Two Kuwaiti sisters who prefer to stay anonymous set up an Instagram account LivingAidKuwait to match people affected by the pandemic with people willing to sponsor them We at Living Aid Kuwait do not accept donations Our way of attracting both sponsors and needy families is by using our Instagram platform to announce the list of families in need Potential sponsors and other needy families who see the list end up approaching us one of the founders told Kuwait Times Some excerpts Kuwait Times How many people are working on this project Currently our team consists of two people and a volunteer to translate the content of our Instagram account Our plan is to add more volunteers in the near future KT How did you come up with this idea When the pandemic first spread and lockdowns started to take effect we wondered about the status of lowincome people and how they are surviving especially when many businesses are terminating their employees and many others are permanently closing However we did not know how to reach them By coincidence we came across the food_box_kw Instagram account Their idea was if you know someone in need order for them from a selection of grocery boxes and babyneed boxes on their website which are very reasonably priced and they would be delivered the next day We sent the account to our house workers to inform us of anyone in need Soon they provided us with 11 names of people in desperate need of something to eat or baby milk and diapers Apparently one of our household workers had put it up as her Facebook status and many reached out for help We were excited finally we had a link to someone in need We made a small Excel sheet and ordered grocery and baby boxes from food_box_kw The next day our house worker informed us of more people reaching out and we repeated the process over and over again until it became too expensive and our WhatsApp was flooded We knew we had to come up with another way to help and to make sure we were not being used We sat for a couple of days thinking it over not wanting to accept donations was very important and we knew many people would want to help those families in need but did not know how Just like us they were clueless Then the idea of matching those people together the families in need and the people willing to help came to our mind It would allow us to help without it depleting our funds We came up with a name and a logo within 10 minutes and started our Instagram page We already had several clips of interviews done the previous day with some families while delivering their food boxes so we posted them on our page to show people our process of obtaining information about each familyperson We decided the familyinterview system is a great way to confirm information that was previously sent to us on our many platforms In addition posting these interviews would allow for transparency and encourage potential sponsors to approach us Collecting information The information we gather from people in need include Their work history were they affected by COVID19 or were destitute from before how many people are they supporting in Kuwait and abroad if their rent is still high we encourage them to have a discussion with the building guard haris the agent wakeel the representative mandoob or even the owner of the building in order to reduce their rent expense and consequently the sponsorship amount if their sponsors decided to cover rent how much they spend on groceries and how much they spend on baby needs Getting in contact This information is gathered in a list and published as our Instagram story livingaidkwt Sponsors approach us via DM choose the family the cost with or without rent and the number of months the sponsorship covers Once we get the agreement from the family in need then their details are sent to the sponsors And with that final step our part is over What is left is for the sponsor to reach out to the family and deliver the funds We encourage the sponsors to chat with the families request to see their living conditions and listen to their stories We keep contact with both the sponsors and the families to resolve any issues Since our account only started on June 13 2020 our plan is to reevaluate the families situation by the fourth week as some businesses are restarting and many employees are going back to work Some families who reside inside lockdown areas have approached us for aid Since visiting them and assessing their situation is not possible for the time being we make sure that their basic needs are covered They are currently included in our database in order to visit them once the lockdown is lifted KT How many families youve sponsored so far Eightyeight families as of June 28 2020 in 16 days KT How do you find the families in need They find us through our Instagram account Also when we visit the families that approach us we come across other people on the streets who need help as well in addition to referrals from previouslysponsored families KT Which areas have the most families in need Farwaniya Mahboula Salmiya Jleeb AlShuyoukh and Hawally KT When will this project end The sponsorship program that our account offers should become redundant when the economic and health effects of the COVID19 pandemic crisis are resolved KT How do you choose the family that will receive help among other families We only accept new family requests when we sponsor the ones we already have As for families in lockdown areas we would like to start with families that have the largest number of children and then move down the list to single people Wed like to add one more thing We are crossreferencing our database with other aid groups in order to mitigate the risk of fraud

is no sign of the pandemic abating in big Indian cities such as Delhi Mumbai and Ahmedabad the scale of the outbreak in India is dwarfed by the United States or large western European powerhouses where thousands have died since the virus spread As compared to many developed nations India is in a much better position due to its holistic approach and quick decisions When India had 550 coronavirus cases we went for a 21day lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus PM Modi said in a statement earlier The lockdown in India has been further extended to May 3 Apart from fighting the pandemic at home India is also playing an essential role in pushing for a common framework in fighting the virus in the SAARC region Consistent with that India sent a 14member Indian army

the preceding years Presently against the backdrop of COVID19 pandemic discussions at the ministerial levels underscored the need to augment the medical resources of Kuwait Defence Forces This

of the collaboration We have heard that the team has provided training to medical personnel what sort of training has taken place Brig Deepak Sreevastava The scope includes assisting in COVID testing and capacity building The team after having visited various medical establishments of the Armed forces and those under the Ministry of health planned a training schedule along with handson workshops on various topics such as Intensive care management and laboratory testing facilities managing cases in the operation theatre planning an OT use of ultrasound and infection prevention and control IPC measures etc to handle the threats arising from the pandemic We are also exploring the possibilities as to how medical staff from India can be engaged to work in the hospitals here to augment the medical team AT Who are the members of the Rapid Response Team Brig Deepak Sreevastava Apart from me the other members include a senior anesthesiologist one specialist in Intensive Care Medicine a public health specialist a respiratory physician a microbiologist two medical officers along with seven paramedical staff AT Did the team also bring in material help in terms of medicines and supplies

this critical time But is Kuwait the first country to receive help in terms of medical personnel Brig Deepak Sreevastava India has been sending its military medical teams regularly to several UN Missions In the current context another rapid team was dispatched to the Maldives on March 9 with a similar purpose Some of the members of the present group have been drawn from the team to the Maldives Kuwait is the second country where a team has been sent India has sent medical supplies to many countries during this outbreak and continues to assist everyone in this time of need AT What is the initial assessment of the RR team of the ground situation in Kuwait Brig Deepak Sreevastava The situation as assessed on the ground is satisfactory indeed The number of cases has been rising however the rate of rising is slower than in many countries At the same time the hospitals both MoH as well as Defence Forces seem to be in an adequate state of preparedness and their approach to segregate COVID suspect cases is well organised AT How has the work progressed since the team arrived in Kuwait Brig Deepak Sreevastava The team has had a productive time since its arrival The

hospitals are well placed to handle surge cases too The message of social distancing has been well spread AT Large numbers of Indians in Kuwait have been infected in recent weeks What is the reason and what can the community do to stop the numbers from increasing Brig Deepak Sreevastava This is indeed a cause of concern However as understood by the team by way of various interactions the reasons can be ascribed to congregation in residential areas following stricter norms advised during this pandemic However it was heartening to see hospitals running information campaigns in Hindi and Bengali

which of course made us all proud AT Indians in Kuwait are also worried about the situation back home Do you have any words of assurance for them Brig Deepak Sreevastava Our government has been working tirelessly to contain the situation The lockdown has been extended and is being strictly enforced The doubling rate of fresh cases has slowed down So while there is a lot of work to do the situation is still very much under control Meanwhile the health infrastructure is also being upgraded at fast pace and hospitals are coping well with the cases so far I understand their apprehensions

world population in confinement and has the potential to topple governments and reshape diplomatic relations The United Nations has appealed for ceasefires in all the major conflicts rocking the planet with its chief Antonio Guterres on Friday warning the worst is yet to come But it remains unclear what the pandemics impact will be on the multiple wars roiling the Middle East Here is an overview of the impact so far on the conflicts in Syria Yemen Libya and Iraq Syria The COVID19 outbreak turned into a pandemic just as a ceasefire reached by the two main foreign power brokers in Syrias nineyearold warRussia and Turkeywas taking effect The three million people living in the ceasefire zone in the countrys northwestern region of Idlib had little hope the deal would hold Yet fears the coronavirus could spread like wildfire across the devastated country appear to have given the truce an extended lease of life According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the month of March saw the lowest civilian death toll since the conflict started in 2011 with 103 deaths The ability of the multiple administrations in Syriathe Damascus government the autonomous Kurdish administration in the northeast and the jihadistled alliance that runs Idlibto manage the coronavirus threat is key to their credibility This epidemic is a way for Damascus to show that the Syrian state is efficient and all territories should be returned under its governance analyst Fabrice Balanche said However the pandemic and the global mobilization it requires could precipitate the departure of USled troops from Syria and neighboring Iraq This in turn could create a vacuum in which the Islamic State jihadist group still reeling from the demise of its caliphate a year ago could seek to step up its attacks Yemen The Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels initially responded positively to the UN appeal for a ceasefire as did neighboring Saudi Arabia which leads a military coalition in support of the government That rare glimmer of hope in the fiveyearold conflict was shortlived however and last week Saudi air defenses intercepted ballistic missiles over Riyadh and a border city fired by the Iranbacked rebels The Saudiled coalition retaliated by striking Houthi targets in the rebelheld capital Sanaa on Monday Talks have repeatedly faltered but the UN envoy Martin Griffiths is holding daily consultations in a bid to clinch a nationwide ceasefire More flareups in Yemen could compound a humanitarian crisis often described as the worst in the world and invite a coronavirus outbreak of catastrophic proportions In a country where the health infrastructure has collapsed where water is a rare commodity and where 24 million people require humanitarian assistance the population fears being wiped out if a ceasefire doesnt allow for adequate aid People will end up dying on the streets bodies will be rotting in the open said Mohammed Omar a taxi driver in the Red Sea port city of Hodeida Libya Much like Yemen the main protagonists in the Libyan conflict initially welcomed the UN ceasefire call but swiftly resumed hostilities Fierce fighting has rocked the south of the capital Tripoli in recent days suggesting the risk of a major coronavirus outbreak is not enough to make guns fall silent Turkey has recently played a key role in the conflict throwing its weight behind the UNrecognized Government of National Accord Fabrice Balanche predicted that accelerated Western disengagement from Middle East conflicts could limit Turkish support to the GNA That could eventually favor forces loyal to easternbased strongman Khalifa Haftar who launched an assault on Tripoli one year ago and has the backing of Russia Egypt and the United Arab Emirates Western countries have been hit hardest by the pandemic which could prompt them to divert both military resources and peacebrokering capacity from foreign conflicts A report by the International Crisis Group said European officials had reported that efforts to secure a ceasefire in Libya were no longer receiving highlevel attention due to the pandemic Iraq Iraq is no longer gripped by fullyfledged conflict but it remains vulnerable to an IS resurgence in some regions and its two main foreign backers are at each others throats Iran and the United States are two of the countries most affected by the coronavirus but there has been no sign of any letup in their battle for influence that has largely played out on Iraqi soil With most nonUS troops in the coalition now gone and some bases evacuated American personnel are now regrouped in a handful of locations in Iraq Washington has deployed Patriot air defense missiles prompting fears of a fresh escalation with Tehran whose proxies it blames for a spate of rocket attacks on bases housing US troops AFP

via the international multilateral system and regional and international organizations to fight the novel coronavirus COVID19 This remark was made by Kuwaits Permanent Representative at the UN Ambassador Mansour AlOtaibi in a written address during a discussion on the pandemics and security He said the world is living in unprecedented times as a result of the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic which poses a transboundary threat and has been able to impact all aspects of our lives health economic social and political and has led to the death of half a million people and infected 10 million more all over the world This pandemic is as described by the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations the biggest challenge facing the world since World War II he said It is also a living example of the close links between pandemics and security This requires all of us to join efforts to confront epidemics and global health crises and limit their harsh impact through cooperation and coordination via the international multilateral system and regional and international organizations A global crisis like this requires global solutions he added Otaibi went on saying We have all witnessed the SecretaryGenerals historic appeal on 23 March 2020 for a global ceasefire in areas where armed conflicts are taking place in order to focus together on the real battle in our lives facing COVID19 Mobilizing efforts We have seen some other initiatives that were aimed at mobilizing international efforts to reduce the spread of the virus and to reduce its effects on societies and people especially the most vulnerable such as women children people with special needs and displaced persons but there is still more that can be done in this regard the Kuwaiti diplomat said The world needs more serious and decisive stances Here we welcome the adoption of resolution 2532 by the Security Council on this global health crisis that we believe constitutes a threat to international peace and security and we note that the Council has previously had clear positions on other health crises such as Ebola and HIVAIDS I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of Tunisia and France in the past few months to issue a Council resolution on COVID19 he noted He emphasized that the effects of this pandemic are expected to touch many of the issues discussed in the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular On the humanitarian front we are witnessing that the humanitarian situation has started to deteriorate in a number of conflictstricken areas and those that suffer from fragile health systems as a result of years of wars and destruction he said Likewise the spread of this virus will have economic and social effects that may reverse the development gains that some countries have achieved which may exacerbate the root causes of armed conflicts such as unemployment poverty inequality and competition for natural resources he added Political repercussions On the other hand there is no doubt that this pandemic may have repercussions at the political level related to the ability and efficiency of countries and governments to respond effectively to limit its spread and provide the necessary medical care to those in need In addition we see that this pandemic has complicated the way forward for political processes in some conflict areas Faced with these impacts caused by COVID19 we urgently need collective and joint action to unite efforts and visions in order to overcome this deadly disease by utilizing all the tools we have at our disposal mobilizing the energies of experts scientists and specialists to find a vaccine and ensure equitable distribution of it especially in developing countries Otaibi said He also underlined the need to work to build the health capabilities of vulnerable countries and societies provide medical and preventive supplies and equipment to enable the health systems around the world to face this pandemic ensure continued delivery of humanitarian aid in light of the pandemics spread to those in need in areas of conflict and natural disasters and strengthen conflictprevention measures However he admitted that it is difficult to achieve these goals without a comprehensive and effective system of multilateralism that contributes to coordinating the efforts of the entire United Nations system regional organizations international financial institutions and other multilateral entities to overcome the most difficult common challenge facing our world today He continued to say that since the outbreak of this pandemic the State of Kuwait has been working as part of the international efforts to confront COVID19 On more than one occasion it has expressed its full support for the appeal of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral for a global ceasefire and participated in various regional and international meetings related to combating this pandemic To date the State of Kuwait has provided 100 million to support global efforts to combat the virus I renew the commitment of the State of Kuwait to support all international efforts aimed at preserving human life protecting peoples health and overcoming COVID19 he added The Kuwaiti diplomat concluded by thanking and appreciating all health professionals around the world and frontline responders for their noble and courageous efforts to confront COVID19 KUNA

faced by humanity in a century In a time of increasingly challenging situation under the shadow of COVID19 it is even more imperative for us to stay rational and sustain confidence with the aim of looking for solutions to contain COVID19 and have faith that humanity will triumph over this health crisis As Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out in his article entitled Solidarity and

cooperation are the most powerful weapons The Chinese government and people have exerted tremendous efforts and sacrifices in fighting against the COVID19 outbreak and have yielded significant results China will never forget the valuable understanding and support from the international community during the most difficult moment in our battle against the virus Accordingly China is fully aware that only with global solidarity can the international community win the battle against this deadly virus China has been shouldering its due responsibilities by supporting the global response to COVID19 in an effort to fulfill China is solid commitment to solidarity and cooperation To date China has set up a special fund on COVID19 cooperation worth 2 billion yuan KD 87 million provided antiepidemic supplies to over 150 countries and international organizations shared experience on prevention control diagnosis and treatment with the rest of the international community established online knowledge center on epidemic prevention and control that is open to all countries and held over 120 video conferences with more than 160 countries and international organizations In the spirit of mutual support China is not only reaching out to developing countries with vulnerable healthcare systems but also extending its outreach to the hardhit developed countries in Europe and the US At the most difficult times when the world is combating COVID19the Chinese medical expert teams put themselves in harm is way and headed to many parts of the world to support the global response which shows their fearlessness and strong sense of commitment China running at full steam around the clock has been providing antiepidemic supplies to other countries to the best of its ability which gives sustained support for ensuring crucial strategic supplies in the global fight against COVID19 According to incomplete statistics from March 1 to April 30 China exported 278 billion face masks and 7341 million

to the global COVID19 response which adequately reflects the Kuwaiti government is great significance attached to international antiepidemic cooperation We appreciate and greatly value the

own people means preserving global health security and helping other countries in containing the outbreak helps to alleviate their burden as only through solidarity can the international community foster greater efforts However we regret that as people all around the world are joining hands in fighting the epidemic some politicians attempt to label the virus politicize COVID19 and continuingly stigmatize and tarnish other countries It is worth underlining that human history is an evolutionary process of constant battles and adaptation between humans and nature The novel coronavirus may appear in any place in the world and its origin should be researched by scientists worldwide Slanders smears blame games and lies will not help tackle the crisis but will only waste more time and even lead to more loss of lives Our common foe is the virus rather than each other Putting political expediency before people is lives and health and spreading political virus are more worthy of vigilance than the novel coronavirus itself As the most professional international institution with the highest authority in global public health security the World Health Organization WHO plays an irreplaceable role in the face of global public health crisis Since the outbreak of COVID19 the WHO under the leadership of DirectorGeneral Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has played a leading and coordinating role in promoting international antiepidemic cooperation by actively fulfilling its responsibilities which has been widely recognized and highly praised by the international community The

containment efforts Both China and Kuwait have all along advocated and practiced multilateralism actively carried out international antiepidemic cooperation and extended unwavering support for the United Nations and the World Health Organization is leading role in coordinating international cooperation against COVID19 Supporting WHO is to safeguarding international solidarity in the battle against the disease We have reasons to believe that with firm confidence and a collective response in solidarity humanity will prevail over this outbreak and embrace a brighter future
