through a whole set of measures including mass surveillance other countries struck by the pandemic are mulling over adopting these best practices Cyber experts have weighed up whether increased security at the expense of privacy is really worth the painThe rapid spread of the Covid19 virus has forced governments to adopt extraordinary measures a number of countries including China Singapore and South Korea have stepped up surveillance to track those infected with the disease The systems which allow one to monitor the movement of people through their smartphones has already been implemented in 11 countries However increased surveillance has immediately raised the issue of a potential abuse of people is privacy by governments and hackers Asian Mass Surveillance Better Safe Than Sorry China was the first one to instrumentalise its street CCTV cameras drones facial recognition technology mobile apps and a whole lot more in order to curb the spread Dr Binoy Kampmark a cyber security expert recollects that the Chinese government call to hightech companies to develop software to conduct surveillance on those who have contracted COVID19 and those in contact with the infected has led to several advances that risk being abused The systems in term of identifying and monitoring individuals regarding the coronavirus have amplified recently says Kampmark Megvii for instance uses artificial intelligence to measure temperature employing what it calls the AI temperature measurement system Thermal cameras are used to identify suspected suffers with abnormally high temperatures He notes that programmes such as the Close Contact Detector app developed jointly by the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and sections of the Chinese government are informing users about someone in their proximity who have been infected or are suspected of being infected For its part Chinese company Baidu claims that it has developed a facialscanning program capable of using AI to identify individuals who do not wear protective masks Kampmark remarks South Korea followed the suit by tracking people is movement through surveillance cameras bank card transactions and mobile phone location data which help create an application mapping coronavirus cases and sending emergency alerts in real time In South Korea a threepronged surveillance approach has been adopted to combat COVID19 all of it typical of pandemic surveillance the cyber security specialist points out CCTV has been deployed along with phone tracking software and banking transactions Such technological infrastructure has been celebrated as containing COVID19 but at the cost of surrendering any vestiges of privacy All of a sudden the private life and even the sexual affairs of Koreans tested positive for Covid19 became the focus of public attention As Hyung Eun Kim of BBC News Korean noted in early March though no names or addresses were given social media users managed to connect the dots identify and embarrass the infected Nevertheless it seems that a large degree of consent has been offered in this regard by the people of South Korea Kampmark suggests British Tracking Apps Pros and Cons Meanwhile the UK that has recently entered into a policeenforced lockdown is reportedly considering exploiting the Asian best practices As The Guardian revealed on 19 March the Boris Johnson government is in talks with mobile phone providers and tech giants to use phone location data to keep an eye on Brits movements amid the outbreak Kevin Curran professor of cyber security at Ulster University says that mobile apps tracking people with confirmed Covid19 cases have already become popular in the country According to him most of these apps suck data from government health institutions or else the newlycreated online tools rely on users selfreporting that they have coronavirus At this time for instance Covid Symptom Tracker is the third most popular app in Apple is UK store and it is the second most popular in Google Play is chart in the UK he elaborates It was created in three days by researchers at Guy is and St Thomas hospitals and King is College London University Though the creators of this app have said that all shared data would be anonymised and not used for any commercial purpose and that users could delete all their records when the crisis was over the professor insists that it would be far better if all the personal information is deleted automatically once the crisis is over as most people will forget to login again and delete their data According to the academic these applications also require users to share personal details to describe symptoms if they have any on a daily basis as well as to give a temperature reading There is a worry however about fake apps and sites which claim to be humanitarian and collect data for hacking purposes the academic warns People have to be very careful and have confidence in who actually created the app However the most worrying data point would be the people is medical history Curran highlights adding that the example of South Korea indicates that privacy concerns of course are real He expresses dismay at poorly protected websites collecting sensitive data on UK patients to track selfreported cases of the coronavirus as one launched by the University of Oxford last week The website was widely criticised for not being secure enough especially as it is dealing with people is medical data and people were able to navigate other peoples data through simple sequential id searching he emphasises Their first mistake was to collect information on a non secured http webpage This was negligent Also assigning sequential IDs to each report did allow what we call enumeration attacks to be done on the website and access other peoples records That actually would be the greater sin Questionable Efficiency Legal Barriers Curran believes that in general it sounds like a good plan to have selfreporting sites and apps as government statistics to a large degree are just guesses as they can only identify patients with the virus who selfpresented However at the same time most people do not know they have the virus he adds suggesting that in reality the tracking apps are not that effective For his part Binoy Kampmark draws attention to legal barriers in terms of confidentiality and data privacy in the European Union and the United States that make getting the public consent for the government surveillance problematic and in some cases constitutionally difficult Nevertheless Israel is Supreme Court has recently allowed the country is security agency Shin Bet to carry out its mass surveillance program to monitor citizens suspected of carrying the coronavirus by using their smartphone data Shin Bet is campaign had been put on pause by the justices until the Knesset formed a Subcommittee on Clandestine Services to supervise the intelligence work As for how effective such programs are in combating coronavirus we often only have the data supplied by the AI companies on the issue Kampmark underscores These are in turn sold to governments as measures of health and safety pandemic surveillance as a virtue That is where the danger lies As for concerns about data leaks any accumulation of data and in this case medical data permits the possibility of hacking The consequences of developing such data sets have not been considered in their entirety The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect

Cyclone Amphan Terming the BJPs highvoltage political campaign as unfortunate amid the most challenging phase of the pandemic is management political commentator Nilanjan Mukhopadhaya says It is very unfortunate that right from the prime minister downward they have been talking only about politics and been very dismissive about the way in which the country has faced the crisis in last three or four months Shah while addressing the Odisha and Bihar rally admitted the lapses but reiterated that the commitment was clear He said that when the coronavirus crisis hit the Narendra Modi government provided a package of around 266 billion or around 10 percent of the countrys annual GDP for 600 million people in the country But at the same time he did not shy away from slamming the opposition However Rahul Kumar who is the national general secretary of the opposition party in Bihar the Rashtriya Lok Samta Party termed the virtual rallies as bombarding the public with a campaign immediately after the lockdown He told Sputnik that there are no takers for Shahs campaign because people from faroff places like Punjab and Madhya Pradesh are still coming to the city on foot in the absence of transport arrangements by the BJP government While Bharatiya Janata Party with Janata Dal is in power in Bihar Kumar says that health facilities in the state are so bad that people dont not even have water to drink or food to eat The rallies are revealing the poverty in the states while the opposition is doing its work to question the government he adds TomTomming BJP Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote a letter to citizens upon completing the first year of his second term where he said Whether it was the topic of Article 370 for national unity and integrity or the happy outcome of the ageold conflict over the Ram temple is construction or the factor disrupting the modern social system the triple talaq or the symbol of India is compassion the citizenship law all these achievements you remember Pointing out the paradox where migrants are being sent home to their villages and factories are being opened to revive the economy Nilanjan says that in the middle of this all the emphasis of the home minister in his three speeches is essentially tomtomming between what the government did between 2014 and 2019 Further he is reiterating four or five very politically divisive decisions which were taken in 2019 the political commentator says REUTERS ADNAN ABIDIIndian Home Ministry Denies Claims Amit Shah is Going to Meet AntiCAA Protesters in Delhi The Prime Minister Narendra Modiled government has lauded itself for stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status under Article 370 passing the Triple Talaq bill which banned the practice of instant divorce by Muslim men and the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act which resulted in widespread violence and protests in the country for over two months Nilanjan believes that with its virtual rallies the BJP is continuing with its very divisive sharply polarising majoritarian campaign at a time when the country needs to be focused on staging a recovery economically and putting people back on their feet economically as well as socially and medically Narrative of We Did Our Best In spite of imposing the strict countrywide lockdown launching the Prime Minister is Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency announcing a 266 billion stimulus package to help the economy and beginning the Shramik Express for migrants the Modi governments efforts have not borne fruit as the COVID19 cases are rising more than before while the economy is still sluggish and health infrastructure remains poor However Nilanjan says The entire emphasis right from prime ministers letter to the citizens to Amit Shahs three virtual rallies then the talking points which have been prepared for its spokespersons and its party presidents press conference on 30th of last month all this is saying that we have done enough for the people to overcome

Interfax special correspondent Renat Abdullin in which he speaks about the prospects of combating the coronavirus conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East Berlin is position on the Nord Stream 2 project and the future of the arms control process Question The world is now preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic What is the situation in Germany Do German and Russian authorities and experts interact in countering the pandemic and elaborating effective countermeasures Answer Germany has recorded slower rates of coronavirus infection over the past several days We are treating this as a reason for cautious optimism but at the same time it remains very important to continue observing the rules and restrictions imposed over the need to counter Covid19 The situation is developing in Germany slightly differently than in Russia The mass spread of the infection had begun in Germany earlier Currently we are using instruments regarding which very active work had been done for a long time to convince the population of their necessity As for interaction between authorities and experts in this sphere we of course need an exchange within the framework of international formats primarily at the level of the WHO and G20 Both our countries are participating in such an exchange Specific bilateral cooperation between Germany and Russia could take place within the framework of our scientific contacts where we have a number of very close partner projects But in any case multilateral cooperation is of significant importance as this challenge is global a solution to it can only be global Q I believe that one of the main problems that you as an ambassador face is the return of German citizens fr om Russia to home after the international communication was suspended How many German citizens now stay in Russia and how many of them are willing to leave Do they stay mainly in Moscow and St Petersburg or in other regions as well How and when is it expected to organize their evacuation Has cooperation with Russian authorities on this issue been established A German citizens who live in Russia are not obliged to register with the embassy But we are using our socalled system Elefand Electronic Register of Germans in Foreign Countries for our fellow citizens who wish to register and who found themselves in Russia at the moment the pandemic began including those who are now expressing their desire to come home Currently the overall list includes about 2500 people Those wishing to leave are mainly tourists or people who came to Russia for a short period of time The majority of them are in Moscow or St Petersburg but there are German citizens in other Russian regions as well At the same time many Germans have already used the opportunity to leave Russia on regular flights in the past few weeks before restrictions on international passenger traffic were imposed However some of them were unable to do so and we are trying to help them we do so as in cooperation with our European partners too For example many citizens of EU member states were able to leave Russia on special flights organized by France and Austria which is a good example of European solidarity Currently no special repatriation flight is organized between Germany and Russia however we are maintaining contacts with Russian authorities the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow on this issue Our colleagues in Berlin also maintain permanent contacts with the Russian embassy Im sure that if things get to organizing direct flights between Russia and Germany our cooperation will prove successful Q As far as I know EU authorities made a decision to extend visas for Russians who for a number of reasons remain in Europe Even if their visas expired they may extend them for 90 days It seems to me that this is a positive humanitarian move on behalf of the EU Are these problems also solved if German citizens remain in Russia and their visas expired A As the Russian side told us the authorities created a mechanism that provides for a rather simple procedure for extending visas for people who remain in Russia and whose visas are expiring I assume that this mechanism works well Apparently there are quite a lot of European citizens who for objective reasons were unable to leave Russia in due time Q Has Berlin been providing any humanitarian aid to Russia in countering the pandemic Do doctors and experts cooperate on developing measures to counter Covid19 A This pandemic is a stress test for healthcare systems all over the world This applies equally to Germany European countries and Russia The exchange of experience is a key element to best manage this crisis I am certain that there is such an exchange at the level of Russian and German medical specialists because thus we all can learn how to facilitate overcoming the severe period of the pandemic more efficiently As to a concrete request to Germany from Russia for humanitarian aid Im not aware of it The German government is up to now providing medical assistance primarily to its neighbors who are suffering from the pandemic the most including Italy France and the United Kingdom On the other hand Germany has provided significant assistance to Russia in repatriating Russian citizens For example a group of Russian tourists was able to return home from the Caribbean region through Germany After they landed in FrankfurtamMain they were issued special transit permits which allowed them to get to Berlin and fly home from there despite the fact that they did not have visas Q How has the pandemic influenced the economy of Germany and the European Union Ursula von der Leyen has recently spoken about the new Marshall Plan for Europe in order to overcome other crisis Are the things that bad Will the EU survive this crisis A This crisis is a challenge not only for healthcare systems all over the world but also for national economies like in Germany European Countries or in Russia and for the global economy as well The German government has adopted an unprecedented package of measures of economic support There has been nothing comparable in Germany is history Moreover the finance ministers of the EU member states adopted a few days ago a largescale package amounting to more than 500 billion euro that provides for various instruments of support at the levels of states and enterprises and at the individual level Additionally the possibility of stimulating largescale investments for the postcrisis period is being considered All this together is a very ambitious package for economic stabilization which was developed in a short period of time At the same time it is a strong and bright symbol of European solidarity Thanks to this solidarity the European Union should be capable of coming out of this crisis even stronger Q The Spanish flu pandemic claimed 20 million lives twice as more as WW I Apparently Europe and the world in general did not learn the lesson then either in from the medical or from global perspective Do you think the coronavirus pandemic will teach people something A I believe that we all will stockpile certain experiences in the wake of this crisis This will contribute to together form the world of tomorrow and solve issues that are crucial for the planet These are the issues like of climate healthcare and natural resources This seems to be particularly important Globalization opens great opportunities for all parts of our planet but at the same time it bears certain risks The fact that problems pass borders of countries and continents unhampered we are witnessing during this pandemic That is why it is key to approach these challenges jointly and this requires achieving the utmost trust and transparency ensuring the provision of reliable statistical data especially at the initial stage of a crisis and show readiness for joint actions I think that the words of a German politician could be applied to the coronavirus pandemic this is a rendezvous with globalization Q To what extent is Berlin concerned about the current situation on the energy market wh ere prices have dropped and the demand is falling Does Germany advocate the stabilization of the market and prices And one more question How do you perceive prospects of the Nord Stream 2 project the construction of which was stopped or it would be right to say delayed because of the US exterritorial sanctions A We follow discussions of energy producing countries on oil production volumes and oil prices with great interest We are most interested in stability on the energy market As for Nord Stream 2 I continue to assume that this project will be implemented as it is designed for a longterm period The companies participating in its implementation will evaluate how the current crisis will affect it For us the Nord Stream 2 project is an element of our diversified sources of energy of our energy policy and thus it is important for the energy security of Germany and other European countries Germany rejects exterritorial sanctions including those imposed by the United States in relation to the Nord Stream 2 project As for this issue Germany advocates a point of view that differs from that of the US Q A possibility of easing sanctions when the world is countering the coronavirus pandemic has been widely disused What do you think about it Is it possible that sanctions will be eased to a certain extent A The sanctions that the EU announced in relation to Russia were formulated quite clearly The terms of their cancellation are well known and clear as well The lifting of sanctions is directly linked to the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and I expect no changes amid the current pandemic I would like to note that despite the sanctions imposed the EU and Russia continue to trade actively in specific fields For example GermanRussian trade which by the way includes pharmaceutical products and medical goods amounted to 53 billion in 2019 This is a 10 decrease compared to 2018 which is explained primarily by lower costs for resources Q Other topical international issues for example the situation in Ukraine are withdrawing into the shadows Have things stopped there or is there any movement Is there any information about a possibility of holding new meetings in the Normandy Format at the level of foreign ministers or heads of state How does Berlin treat Moscow is position that rather clearly and harshly said that any net meeting in the Normandy Format may take place only after considerable progress in the implementation process is reached A Of course you are right Before a summit or a meeting at the level of foreign ministers the situation would have to undergo certain changes I must say that over the weeks and months that have passed since the Paris meeting the process has halted slightly Nevertheless active negotiations are underway and Germany and France are not weakening their activity for a second and are continuing to make proposals on how progress could be made as far as the details are concerned These may be small issues but they allow at least small progress to be made I would like to touch on another aspect in the current situation This is the issue of denying access to a number of areas in eastern Ukraine for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission allegedly because of the spread of coronavirus I hope that Russia will use its influence and that local authorities in eastern Ukraine will also take measures to grant access to officers of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in order to secure a high level of transparency Q I am sorry for being persistent but I would like to ask you once again I am right to understand that currently no real dates of holding a Normandy meeting in any format are in sight Q Two more important international topics are the situation in Syria is Idlib and Libya It seems that there is certain pause in hostilities What is Germany is attitude to prospects of the development of the situation in these two trouble spots Is Germany satisfied with interaction with Russia in settling them A You are right about the situation in Libya The German government is engaged in settling this conflict within the framework of the Berlin process Regretfully hostilities near Tripoli are continuing A ceasefire has so far failed to be implemented That is why it is still necessary for all who are involved to exert their influence on the conflicting sides in order to stabilize the situation This is of utmost importance in respect to the humanitarian situation in which the people of Libya find themselves keeping in mind the pandemic which is about to affect this entire region as well A certain calm period can be seen in Idlib but this is not the end of the war as in certain districts hostilities have continued It is very important to ensure access to humanitarian aid for the population there especially amid the possible pandemic They live in an especially fragile situation This also applies to other Syrian regions wh ere as a result of the deliberate shelling of hospitals medical aid cannot be provided to any satisfactory extent One more important aspect related to Syria Just a few days ago the OPCW published a report on chemical attacks in March 2017 As part of this report it was unambiguously shown for the first time what side was responsible for using chemical weapons In this case it is the Syrian army It is crucial that the culprits are held liable for such horrendous crimes they committed in using chemical agents Q What is Berlin is position on the future arms control and strategic stability process after the collapse of the INF Treaty and vague prospects of the New START Treaty In your opinion what format is the most preferable for the further dialogue on these fundamental problems Between Russia and the United States Or in a broader international format for example Washington wants to engage China while Moscow wants to engage the United Kingdom and France From Germany is point of view what is the most preferable format allowing to reach an agreement as soon as possible Because uncertainty in this area is potentially very dangerous including for security of Europe and Germany A The German government and governments of other countries are very much disappointed by the situation that is coming to shape in the arms control sphere after the INF Treaty was first breached and later ruptured It is important that we can continue to rely on arms control mechanisms that are based on concrete international treaties and agreements As for the New START Treaty we hope and this corresponds with our strategic interests that this agreement will be extended This issue is about preserving the mechanisms of control and verification over the measures provided by this agreement If we look at the development of the situation in the past years and decades apparently China has considerably expanded its potential in this sphere This is why we hope for and comprehensively advocate for engaging China in arms control mechanisms This requires negotiations even if this process is difficult and demands great patience I would also like to touch on one more aspect which is new arms technologies As for their classification and applicability we also need clarity and transparency There should be no blank spaces in the sphere of arms control Q The 75th anniversary of the WW II victory is approaching What is Germany is attitude to this date May a highranking delegation visit Moscow on May 9 A We know how this anniversary is important to Russia We in Germany treat this event with greatest respect too For example we had scheduled a solemn state ceremony dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the end of WW II for May 8 Regretfully it had to be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic We will carefully follow the respective situation in Russia and discussions on the format of events in Moscow on May 9 As soon as there will be clarity we will be able to understand in what form Germany may participate in it I would like to stress that for us this commemoration gains additional significance too as a symbol for the reconciliation of the people of the two countries This reconciliation we value and esteem highly Q As far as we know military archives are expected to be transferred as part of the celebrations Could you please tell us more details A This joint project is very important for us because it affects the fates of prisoners of war from both countries In this regard an agreement was reached on the transfer of digital copies of archive materials dealing directly with the fates of prisoners of war A large number of historians from both countries and different organizations are involved Currently we are working on transferring the first package of digital data which includes materials on 20000 prisoners of war In the future the project will cover about 500000 copies of archival data We aspire to organize the transfer of the first package before the upcoming solemn memorial date We are currently considering together with our Russian colleagues how to organize this event in an atmosphere that is appropriate to the date This project we consider an important political step a political symbol but it has a deep sense at the level of interpersonal relations as well because as a result of this work many families will learn of the fates of their relatives Q Is there any progress in the investigation of the murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin Is there contact with the Russian side in this area A The Federal Prosecutor General of Germany is conducting the investigation so it is being supervised by the justice agencies I hope that as part of the investigation of this murder case a satisfactory cooperation with the competent Russian authorities has been established

millions of vulnerable people especially in Southern Africa are at risk of malnutrition due to the continent having gone into lockdown in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus Deprose Muchena the regional director from Amnesty International has told Sputnik The continent has been overall reporting a relatively low number of coronavirus cases in comparison to Europe the Americas or Asia but experts say this can be partially explained by the lack of testing capabilities and fragile health care systems in many countries across Africa According to John Hopkins University South Africa and Egypt are currently the two epicenters of COVID19 on the continent with 5359 and 5268 cumulative cases respectively African countries have largely followed the example of western nations and imposed similar coronavirus response measures and lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus We are talking about millions of people in Southern Africa being at risk and vulnerable to hunger because the incomes that they make have been dwindling as a result of the lockdown Muchena said The regional director at Amnesty emphasized that longterm lockdowns could also pose a risk to food production in East Africa where locusts are destroying fields Muchena warned that malnutrition would exacerbate the longterm impact of the virus on the continent where a significant portion of the population suffers from preexisting conditions like tuberculosis and HIV is homeless or lives in indigenous communities and has low immunity to infectious diseases Any deprivation of additional nutrients they need in their bodies feeds onto preexisting disease patterns That undermines the capacity for these governments to be saying we are fighting the virus when the right to life is itself being threatened he said Muchena added that lockdowns undermined peoples ability to survive COPYPASTE APPROACH Muchena who is in charge of Amnesty International in Southern and Eastern Africa said that copying the western approach did more harm to African nations and countries on the continent should come up with other ways to deal with the pandemic It is important for African governments not to copy and paste what European countries are doing but to have very specific responses that meet the needs of their own population Muchena said Earlier in April the prominent human rights watchdog raised alarm saying that putting millions of people across Southern African states into lockdown to curb the spread of the epidemic risked starving them Human rights groups across the continent are asking for specific measures that respond to the needs of the population that is now locked down The prevention the tracing the treatment is all ok but people live on food people live on water and those are not available Muchena said You are talking of a continent that is already afflicted by a triple burden of unemployment poverty and inequality And with unemployment and inequality so high across the African continent the majority of people really live from hand to mouth meaning that they cannot afford to remain in lockdown for a week longer he argued Governments must take measures to give people financial means to stockpile food or access it in different markets Muchena stressed He warned that Africa is public health systems were not strong enough to withstand the impact of the health crisis if a significant number of people required hospitalization In South Sudan alone they have four ventilators and five vicepresidents Therefore African governments should put the money generated through the European Union is freeze on debt repayments into public health care to better respond to the people is needs Muchena insisted We should ensure that governments are implementing human rightsconsistent responses to the pandemic Once resources are there its important that governments in Africa prioritize and deliver on the specific human rights needs of especially marginalized groups he said SOCIAL UNREST Growing food insecurity risks are amplifying the social unrest that is already very real in parts of Africa as people struggle under the lockdown We are seeing it already In South Africa and this is in the country where we are actually seeing significant social protection response compared to other countries Muchena said He estimated that almost 80 percent of Africans were employed in the informal sector with millions more living on social benefits With 80 percent of the economies locked down when the informal sector provides the daily incomes under 1 dollar a day it just creates that social condition for protests to take off he warned Amnesty International has also condemned unprovoked police brutality against people in Kenya and Zimbabwe who violated lockdown measures in order to feed themselves and their families We have reported cases of people being arrested while they were going to buy food in Angola In Zimbabwe police raided a market place causing panic and people running away leaving their food which police confiscated Muchena said The backlash against police has prompted police chiefs in Uganda Kenya and Namibia to apologize in the past two weeks he added INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE The Amnesty International official stressed that foreign assistance to the poorest African countries was essential to avoid a largescale humanitarian crisis Its important for the international community to respond to a new course for international cooperation and assistance in order to create fiscal space African governments will need in order to mobilize new resources to reinvest in the public health system and social protection he said Africa requires a new framework for cooperation increased investment and possibly a full debt relief especially for lowincome countries with limited resources according to Muchena

has cooked up new accusations against Russia of allegedly trying to interfere in Western countries election processes The British parliaments Intelligence and Security Committee published a report this week claiming that Moscow is not only meddling in British domestic politics but also is seeking to undermine the rules based international order Russian officials and experts in turn argue that these Russophobic accusations are farfetched and believe that this report demonstrates the UKs attempt to find itself in a changed modern world as well as search for a common enemy with the West Izvestia writes According to experts the British government had shelved the documents publication for nearly one year and a half because the report mentioned Brexit thus putting UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in an unfavorable light Disinformation the use of trolls for propaganda campaigns on the Internet and distortions in the coverage provided by Russian stateowned international broadcasters such as RT and Sputnik are on the list of accusations in the 50page document However this report like a dozen of similar others lacks one but very important detail evidence the paper says The British MPs also voiced concerns over Russian businessmen who moved to the UK and many of whom allegedly maintain close relations with Russian authorities although some of them claim to belong to opposition circles Meanwhile the authors of the report say that Western countries can effectively counter Russias aggressive action through joint efforts and a continuing international consensus is needed against Moscow Program Director of Valdai International Discussion Club Timofei Bordachev notes that this report reflects what accumulated and happened in British foreign policy in relations with Russia and the EU this is the continuation of the UKs rather chaotic search for its place in the world According to the expert currently the United Kingdom is facing serious problems and many among them are linked to the coronavirus pandemic Furthermore the British establishment seeks to bring back the practice used during the confrontation between the West and the Soviet Union The current international environment is not in favor of the US and its allies including the UK so London seeks to take action Nezavisimaya Gazeta Erdogan goads Greece to spook Haftars allies Turkey is testing Greeces red lines in the eastern Mediterranean region Athens in turn condemned seismic exploration works by a Turkish vessel near a disputed maritime area as intervention and put its armed forces on standby In response Ankara rejected these claims Experts believe that the Turkish leaderships moves are linked to the Libyan conflict President Recep Tayyip Erdogan apparently seeks to test the reaction of his opponents Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes The timing of Turkeys operation is not a coincidence said Jalel Harchaoui a research fellow at the Netherlandsbased Clingendael Institute According to the expert there is a link between Ankaras steps and the latest moves of its regional opponent Egypt in the Libyan conflict In June Cairo which supports Libyan National Army Commander Khalifa Haftar put forward its initiative to iron out the military crisis in Libya This month after understanding that the Turkishbacked LNA opponents are unstoppable Egypt warned that would send troops to its neighbor to protect regional security Ankaras supposed audience is both Greece and Egypt Harchaoui noted Athens and Cairo are in talks on the demarcation of an exclusive economic zone in the sea which runs counter to Turkeys position along the Mediterranean regions borders Ankara seeks to use its confrontational behavior as a way to bully Greece into being flexible in negotiations According to the expert Russia is not expected to react to the maritime dispute Russian President Vladimir Putin has not yet made a strategic decision to directly join a lengthy war in Libya and ensure Haftars absolute victory although there is such an opportunity Kommersant Central Asia battles coronavirus pandemic COVID19 has hit the Central Asian region very hard Russian military medics who earlier helped Italy Serbia Armenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were sent for the first time there A plane from the Russian Defense Ministry transported doctors and humanitarian assistance consisting of medication and equipment to the tune of 150 mln rubles 21 mln to Kyrgyzstan Hundreds of Russian doctors will be working in hospitals in Bishkek and Osh to treat coronavirus patients Although average population density in Kyrgyzstan is just 32 people per square kilometer the coronavirus infection rate started rapidly climbing there Kommersant writes To date more than 29000 cases and 1100 deaths have been registered in the country As a comparison in Moscow where the average population density is more than 5000 people per square kilometer and the population is at least twice as much as in entire Kyrgyzstan some 600 new COVID19 cases have been recorded Meanwhile Kyrgyzstan has recorded more than 1000 cases In June official statements said that the situation in the Central Asian country was virtually critical Other Central Asian countries are also facing an uphill battle against coronavirus The first COVID19 case in the region was registered rather late only on March 13 but by late June the situation had sharply deteriorated By July 22 Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Uzbekistan and Tajikistan had registered a total of 130000 cases of the disease Kazakhstan accounts for more than half of them tallying up over 76000 cases Against this background the authorities reinstated a national lockdown which had been in force between midMarch and early May The best situation is now seen in Turkmenistan The republic has not registered a single COVID19 case However the authorities decided to close the main market in the capital in midJuly for sanitary measures and suspended train services until July 23 Cafes and restaurants were also shut down under preventive measures Citizens were strongly advised to wear masks because of an excessive amount of dust in the air Meanwhile Reporters Without Borders an international NGO reported that in late March the Turkmen authorities prohibited journalists to use the world coronavirus in publications and withdrew it from special booklets which the Health Ministry sends to educational institutions hospitals and offices Nezavisimaya Gazeta Russian gold heads out for export not for reserves Gold export from Russia in MarchMay saw an 11fold surge compared with last spring to 42 bln and an 8fold hike in terms of tonnes due to the increase in prices on precious metal and the Central Banks decision to suspend its purchases according to research by the FinExpertiza international audit and consulting network Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes Precious metals primarily gold are seen as a traditional safe asset during crises Over the past years the Russian Central Bank has been pumping up the share of gold in international reserves but announced that it would stop purchasing gold on April 1 Experts believe that there are several reasons why the Central Bank stopped buying gold from domestic producers The share of gold in reserves reached a rather high level 20 and due to huge demand the cost of the real metal was significantly higher than on its futures trading Another possible reason is that the regulator helped producers to earn money According to chief analyst at TeleTrade Mark Goykhman Russia produces nearly 330 tonnes of gold per year as of 2019 and is ranked third in the world Its impossible to sell that volume on the domestic market he said Until April 2020 the Central Bank was the main buyer As of March 1 2020 the regulator had 2290 tonnes in its reserves However in the near future the Central Bank is unlikely to resume massive gold purchases This does not only allow but also forces gold producers to increase the export of the precious metal There is no point in restraining their activities in production and export On the contrary given the current environment all parties would benefit The country receives an inflow of foreign exchange revenues to some extent partially replacing the decline in revenues from oil and gas Exporters are significantly improving their sales income and profits Accordingly in the foreseeable future the sales of the precious metal abroad from Russia are likely to increase the expert believes Izvestia Retail online trade revenues nearly triple in Russia The coronavirus spread gave a serious boost to developing retail online trade This May its volume grew 28 times higher than the same period last year according to Russias official statistics Retailers began actively entering online market The demand in new domain names most of them are names of famous brands grew 60 Some 37 domain buyers opened Internet shops while 24 created promo sites Izvestia writes During the lockdown Russians got accustomed to online shopping and accordingly the sales of food and snacks skyrocketed the Ministry of Industry and Trades press service said If before the coronavirus spread Internet trade was used as a convenient channel for purchasing largesized goods which are rarely in demand during the pandemic people started actively buying goods on the Internet to satisfy their everyday needs the ministry explained However after the coronavirus restrictions were lifted online sales dropped it noted President of the Association of Internet Trade Companies Artem Sokolov told Izvestia that the coronavirus situation drastically changed the landscape of online trade Right in front of our eyes new forms of delivery were created unique digital solutions for shopping in one click came into our lives via mobile apps and the whole world was able to look at distance shopping not only from the point of view of convenience when shopping but also from the point of view of security he said The most convenient store is not the one located in a separate building but on a smartphone in a persons hands The expert is sure that this trend will remain since millions of people wish to obtain essential necessities without leaving their home Businesses will invest more resources into cultivating new technologies to satisfy high demand through Internet shopping TASS is not

One of the key intrigues of the global agenda for the coming months is who and when will develop a COVID19 vaccine Many countries have decided to reach this goal together and have amassed 74 bln euro through a fundraising campaign the Coronavirus Global Response that kicked off on May 4 The effort was launched by eight countries the United Kingdom Germany Italy Canada Norway Saudi Arabia France and Japan with the support of the World Health Organization and the GAVI and CEPI alliances which should control the distribution of the funds Meanwhile the United States has vowed to create its own vaccine while Russia has taken a waitandsee attitude Moscow is not refusing to take part in the global fundraising campaign but it has not stopped its own research Kommersant business daily writes Many countries rely on their own financing and research and whats more dozens of laboratories around the world have declared that they were working on a vaccine and even launched clinical tests In particular China and India have not expressed any wish to make a contribution A US delegate did not take part in the marathon either The White House expects to get 100 mln doses of the new vaccine this year and the US has launched a national project to fasttrack a COVID19 vaccine dubbed Operation Warp Speed We arent seeing a scenario from Hollywood disaster movies when in the face of an existential threat humanity forgets about disagreements and unites In the fight against COVID19 national selfishness prevails This can be seen both in the inability of cooperation within the G20 framework and in the suspension of US contributions to the WHO said Anna Velikaya a research fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations IMEMO of the Russian Academy of Sciences The creation of the vaccine will become a milestone event of the 21st century and the country that will achieve success will show the entire world its attractive conditions for fostering advanced areas of science and a favorable environment for the development of competent state policy in this sector Russia has yet to decide whether it will take part in the global initiative or not the paper writes On the one hand Russian officials have welcomed the WHOs efforts but on the other hand Russia has not announced plans to sponsor global efforts on creating the vaccine preferring to focus on its own developments XXX Izvestia EU up in arms over Russias growing Balkan influence amid COVID19 pandemic While some EU memberstates complain that Brussels is not providing them with enough financial and humanitarian assistance in combating COVID19 the European Commission has decided to allocate funds for six postSoviet states Georgia Ukraine Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus and Moldova The West has never concealed that the goal of the Eastern Partnership is to pull former Soviet countries out of Russias orbit This time there are plans to earmark 37 mln euro to develop civil society and promote political reforms Besides the EU is concerned about the rising influence of Russia and China which have been actively helping the Balkan states combat the coronavirus pandemic Izvestia writes Brussels is sluggishly sticking to its policy to contain Russia in the postSoviet space Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics National Research University Dmitry Suslov told the paper Its important for the EU especially during the coronavirus pandemic to show that it remains a geopolitical actor and that it is here to stay the expert said In the current environment building relations with Eastern Partnership countries is one of the major opportunities for European bodies to gain attention the expert said Brussels is alarmed by the assistance provided by Russia to EU countries So they want to highlight that Brussels is not changing its policy concerning the postSoviet space So it will keep supporting mainly Ukraine Georgia and other Eastern Partnership countries Recently Brussels has been worried about growing Russian and Chinese influence in the Western Balkans amid the coronavirus pandemic On May 6 an online summit was held with the aim of showing the Balkan states that Brussels wants them to join the EU Another goal of this event was also to demonstrate that these countries cannot align themselves too closely to Russia and China and should act accordingly European diplomats believe that their financial support granted to the Balkans is more important than humanitarian aid provided by Moscow and Beijing However the Balkans have a different opinion XXX Nezavisimaya Gazeta Russia thwarts NATOs Arctic push Despite the coronavirus pandemic Russian and NATO navies have switched to a new stage of vying for the sphere of influence in the Arctic A NATO naval strike group consisting of four US and UK warships had entered the Barents Sea for the first time over the past decades The Pentagon notified Russia about the operation last week in order to prevent a misunderstanding reduce the risks and prevent any escalation However the NATO strike group in the Arctic close to Russias borders forced the Russian Fleet to act Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes The Russian cruiser Marshal Ustinov which is designed to attack strike groups is gearing up for military maneuvers and the area of live firing will be closed for navigation and flights These exercises are not a coincidence given the steps of the NATO strike groups in the Barents Sea the paper reports This not the first time the Russian Navy is using this tactic The naval proving ground where live firing from the Marshal Ustinov cruiser will be conducted is located in the neutral waters to the north of the main naval base of the Northern Fleet The closure of a certain area of the Barents Sea for navigation will serve as one of the obstacles in the maneuvers of NATO ships especially if they move towards Russias borders said Chairman of the Central Committee of All Russian trade union of servicemen Oleg Shvedkov He also stressed that the NATO strike groups operation in the Barents Sea is an unfriendly act The US guidedmissile destroyers USS Porter and USS Donald Cook are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles and important Russian military and strategic areas are within their strike radius including naval bases on the Kolsky Peninsula such as the key base of the Northern Fleet Severomorsk where Russian surface ships and nuclearpowered vessels are concentrated XXX Izvestia US seeks to mine Moon without Russia Washington has started drafting an international agreement to outline the terms of mining on the Moon The potential partners of the socalled Artemis Accords will be Canada Japan European nations and the United Arab Emirates However Russia the worlds major space power will be excluded from this deal The Pentagon is against Moscows participation claiming that Russian satellites in nearearth orbit conduct maneuvers allegedly posing a threat to US spacecraft Meanwhile Russia is not planning to give up its interests on the Moon Izvestia writes The White Houses plans have stirred up a negative response from Moscow Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that US President Donald Trumps comments on exploiting lunar resources need to be analyzed by lawyers but any attempts at space privatization were unacceptable Deputy Director General at Russias state space corporation Roscosmos Sergey Saveliev also emphasized that any efforts at expropriating space and aggressive plans on capturing the territories of other planets would hardly contribute to productive international cooperation Washingtons scheme for lunar mining amid the current coronavirus pandemic seems at least premature and even not quite appropriate and could be just another populist move by the Trump administration the paper writes According to Program Director at the Valdai Discussion Club and the Russian International Affairs Council RIAC Ivan Timofeev given that countries lack opportunities for a fullfledged Moon exploration mission during the pandemic its just ridiculous to write some agreements and fantasize who will occupy territories so this adds nothing but extra irritants to relations for example with Russia Anyway currently there are no means of delivering lunar resources to Earth Thats why the US plans are nothing more than chestthumping and pulling the wool over everybodys eyes said Vyacheslav Dokuchayev a leading research fellow at the Institute for Nuclear Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences XXX Kommersant Russia should step up efforts on going green experts say The Energy Center of the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo has laid out scenarios of Russias response to other countries policies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions even amid declining Russian hydrocarbon exports According to researchers the best choice for Russia would be to lead efforts in this direction opting for ambitious goals on cutting emissions and redirecting investments in extracting fossil fuels in favor of lowcarbon technologies The research cited by Kommersant business daily notes that the key role in the environmental agenda is not only how it is implemented and regulated in Russia but also the plans of other countries many of which are major importers of Russias fuelandenergy sector on reducing greenhouse gas emissions The key theses of the report are that over the past 40 years global warming in Russia has been 25 times quicker than on average on the planet and 45 times quicker in the Russian Arctic According to the forecast this pace is going to climb At the same time the global environmental agenda creates a longterm threat to key Russian exports such as oil petroleum products coal natural gas metals and products from the timber and chemical industry The hydrocarbon trace of goods is becoming not only an important consumer feature but also a basis for introducing border hydrocarbon regulations such as the Border Carbon Tax in the EU Russia is reaction to the climate threat may depend on the pace of the global response to climate change and the attitude of Russian society and the state to this problem The key choice arises between two extreme scenarios Continuing Current Policies and Global Climate Unity the study said In both scenarios Russian hydrocarbon exports will drop 15 by 2040 by volume and 17 by value According to this research the decline in energy exports creates a threat that Russias annual GDP growth rate will fall to 0608 by 2040 These estimates were made before the coronavirus pandemic and given COVID19s influence on energy markets all these forecasts will be more negative the authors said TASS is not responsible

global pandemic where everyone else is trying to do the same New York has been competing with several other states to purchase muchneeded ventilators from China Its like being on eBay Cuomo recently told the press with 50 states bidding against one another driving the price up The issue became even more complicated when the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA entered the bidding war They bigfooted us Cuomo said driving the price per ventilator up to 25000 Were going broke Cuomo estimates that New York will need upwards of 40000 ventilators to be able to handle the influx of stricken patients when the outbreak hits its peak At the moment New York has 17000 ventilators availableincluding 2500 on order from Chinaand Cuomo doesnt expect any more Were on our own Plans are in place to begin imposing a triage system to prioritize ventilator availability if and when the current stockpile is exhausted These plans include the issuance of an emergency waiver that permits health care providers to take a patient off a ventilator to make it available for another patient deemed to be more viablethat is who has a greater expectation of surviving the disease Cuomos predicament is being played out around the world in places like Italy Spainand Iran where the outbreak of coronavirus has hit particularly hard The difference however is that while the US Italy and Spain are able to scour the global market in search of lifesaving medical supplies Iran is not US sanctions targeting the Iranian financial system ostensibly imposed to prevent money laundering by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command which has been heavily sanctioned by the US over the years have made it virtually impossible for Iran to pay for humanitarian supplies needed to fight the coronavirus outbreak As bad as it is for Governor Cuomo at least he can enter a bidding war for medical supplies Iran cant even get its foot in the door and it is costing lives Making matters worse at a time when the international community is pleading for the US to ease sanctions so Iran can better cope with an outbreak that is taking a life every ten minutes the US instead doubled down further tightening its death grip on the Iranian economy The global coronavirus pandemic will eventually end and when it does there will be an accounting for how nations behaved Nations like Russia and China have been repeatedly vilified in the US media for any number of reasonseven the Russian aid shipment containing the sanctioned ventilators has been dismissed as a propaganda ploy What then do you call the US blatant disregard for select human lives The callous indifference displayed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials to the suffering of the Iranian people by increasing sanctions at a time when the situation cries out for them to be lifted in order to save lives when contrasted to the ease in which US sanctions on Russia are ignored when lifesaving medical equipment is needed drives home the point that as far as the US is concerned human life only matters when it is an American one That might play well among American voters it shouldnt but for the rest of the world it is a clear sign that hypocrisy not humanitarianism is the word that will define the US going forward EDITORS NOTE A previous version of this article erroneously stated that entering a financial relationship with RDIF is prosecutable under the US sanctions regime In reality RDIF is under sectoral sanctions that only apply to certain interactions which according to a State Department spokesperson do not include purchases of medical equipment The article has been changed accordingly Think your friends would be interested Share this story The statements views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and

have been erupting across countries in Africa as the coronavirus and lockdown procedures installed in a bid to try and slow down its spread have dramatically exacerbated food shortages reported the Daily Mail Several violent protests have broken out across South Africa over access to food parcels being handed out by authorities with people defying social distancing measures hurling rocks at police and setting up street barricades Police have been dispersing angry crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets Mr President we are in the middle of a food crisis Its war out here This plea on social media from a community leader in Mitchells Plain township in Cape Town South Africa underscored the volatility of the situation Joanie Fredericks addressed the plea to President Cyril Ramaphosa over the fiveweek lockdown imposed to try and slow down the spread of the coronavirus As huge crowds have been queuing for food distributed by Fredericks and other volunteers the community leader voiced his fears for how things might spiral further out of control When we started out feeding people we started out with the very vulnerable the children the disabled people and the pensioners But we are way past that Mr President we are past the stage of sending people away an emotional Fredericks pleaded Residents were quoted as saying hunger has driven people to loot shops in Cape Town with skirmishes breaking out as the fourth week of a 35day shutdown installed on 27 March led to many losing their informal earnings There is a bunch of us at home getting fat and there is a bunch of people who really have nothing And it speaks a lot about the inequalities in South Africa that are likely to come out Julian May director of the Centre of Excellence in Food Security at the University of the Western Cape was cited as saying The official added As people are not getting food parcels or hear of other people getting parcels they are starting to react And I do not think that is going to ease unless there is more rapid delivery of food to people in poor areas The Institute for Poverty Land and Agrarian Studies PLAAS issued a warning that there is every likelihood of violent conflict

efforts experts were cited by the Guardian as warning the current unrest starting to grip the continent could spiral out of control From a food security perspective some places are very close to famine The number of people on the verge of being extremely vulnerable was already very high What we fear is that this number will further increase because of the impact of Covid19 on food security Dominique Burgeon the director of emergencies at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO was quoted as saying Compounding the pandemic crisis was the fact that swathes of the horn of Africa were

Russia with Love humanitarian mission to help stop the health crisis is still working in Bergamo the epicentre of COVID19 in LombardyRussian medical personnel have participated in the disinfection of various nursing homes where the highest mortality rate in Bergamo 182 was recorded Now 32 Russian virologists together with their Italian colleagues are treating coronavirus patients in a new field hospital set up at the Bergamo Fair Thus began the Russian team is second phase of work which arrived in Italy as part of an agreement between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Oliviero Valoti Bergamo Field Hospital is chief doctor has shared his views on how Russian specialists are working in Italy as well as what results theyve managed to achieve Sputnik How do you assess the work of the Russian virologists From the perspective of health procedures was it easy to interact with the Russian team Oliviero Valoti From a professional point of view our Russian colleagues are certainly highlevel specialists Obviously at the beginning we had to understand how much they could do and whether their methods were in line with our standards regarding intensive care In a very short time we realised that their way of working was absolutely aligned with what we do I must say that we were very lucky because a Russian doctor who had been living in Italy for 20 years worked in our intensive care unit in Bergamo In the early days she stayed to work in the field hospital set up at the fair helping us to communicate with our colleagues from the Russian Armed Forces which was great since she managed to quickly lift the language barrier At the same time the Russian team is always accompanied by excellent translators who also have great command of medical terminology Sputnik The Bergamo Field Hospital is designed for 142 patients with 72 of them being in intensive and subintensive care Could you tell us more about what the Russian specialists are dealing with now What kind of job have you assigned them with Oliviero Valoti Up until now we have entrusted this group of Russian specialists with intensive and subintensive care patients These are patients who need serious treatment they are either intubated and therefore need ventilation or they are weaning from respiratory support and are just starting to breathe autonomously And then there are also patients who need respiratory support with additional oxygen they can be considered subintensive care patients Id say they are 50 percent of one type and 50 percent of the other type Not so long ago we got another group of Russian specialists whom my colleagues call general practitioners which is not very common here Weve realised that they are general practitioners not intensive care doctors and can take care of less serious patients They have also started collaborating with Italian doctors and nurses in the hospital and I must say that they are helping us a lot because they help reduce the load and evenly distribute the number of shifts Sputnik Do you manage to work together Is there any tension or competition between doctors Oliviero Valoti Absolutely not therere absolutely no problems The doctors are interacting well and discussing possible treatment options together Id say they have a great relationship Sputnik Is it possible to make first assessments Have the Russian doctors managed to help you reduce the load in the intensive care units Oliviero Valoti Weve managed to perfect our interaction with the Russian doctors and together weve reduced the load on the intensive care units in the main hospital building Weve also managed to transfer to the department several patients admitted to the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo and this has certainly unloaded the entire hospital Sputnik How many patients have already been transferred to the department of the Russian doctors Oliviero Valoti To date 29 patients have been transferred to the intensive care unit managed by our Russian colleagues Sputnik Have the Russian doctors used any new methods or innovative equipment against the coronavirus that have helped Bergamo cope with the emergency Oliviero Valoti I havent seen any particular innovative methods I must say however that they brought several dozen ventilators for treating patients 29 in total We can say that they are now enough Also all the other intensive care equipment at this temporary hospital has also been brought by our Russian colleagues Sputnik Fortunately the virus spread in Bergamo is slowing down for the first time in 40 days there are no new coffins in the city church How long do you think youre going to need the support of the Russian doctors Oliviero Valoti Personally I think it would be important to have their support until what we call Stage 2 begins We must understand what will happen when we gradually return to normal life Actually Im concerned that people will start going out again because we have yet to understand whether the epidemic will worsen when people start going out again It would be great to be able to get help from Russian doctors until we are sure that there will be no new outbreak and consequently no new patients who need intensive care As soon as everything is settled of course they will go back home Sputnik The other day the Italian foreign minister announced that in the coming weeks new flights from Russia will deliver mechanical ventilation devices to Italy Do you still feel the shortage of medical equipment Do you need further support from Russia Oliviero Valoti I dont think we still need it in Bergamo because the intensive care units which were urgently deployed to receive serious patients will soon be closed and dismantled We have several hospitals that if necessary can be equipped with all the equipment brought by our Russian colleagues some of the equipment will be stored separately Therefore I think there is no further need unless of course this virus gives us some new surprises Alas since this is a new disease no one can know this Sputnik I also hope that you will no longer need new equipment and that we will all soon get out of this emergency Thank you for your work Oliviero Valoti Thank you too thanks to Russia and the Russians The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of

justintime supply chains have been providing cheap labor and products but the coronavirus pandemic has shown us the huge cost of neglected independence Covid19 has opened the kimono of globalism and whats underneath is ugly The virus has illustrated the importance of and our reliance on justintime supply chains Supply chains are only as strong as their weakest link If any ingredient is missing from that supply chain the nation controlling that commodity can break it causing devastating economic geopolitical and social consequences For example take emergency medical supplies and critical drugs Most antibiotics as well as the main ingredients to produce them are made in China India has prohibited the export of hydroxychloroquine the malaria drug that President Trump touted as a game changer in the treatment of Coronavirus Even basic overthecounter drugs like paracetamol are outofstock Hens teeth and capable Central Bankers seem easier to find than N95 facemasks gloves thermometers pulse oximeters hand sanitiser and isopropyl alcohol We also rely on other nations electrical parts to run critical infrastructure trucks trains planes and automobiles The imposition of national export bans on medical supply chain ingredients is a wakeup call for every nation state that has become reliant upon other nations for products they no longer produce domestically Scarcity of critical commodities and medical supplies needs to be part of every National Security dialogue People is lives depend upon the unrestricted access to and supply of these drugs medical products and equipment which today thanks to 30 years of neoliberal globalism are now beyond our control We need to rebuild this infrastructure and become selfsufficient in providing necessities Right now we do not have the ventilators or drugs required to combat and treat Covid19 who decides who lives or dies We should NEVER have been in this position we must never be in it again Any disruption to our supply chain will result in a surge in unemployment and mortgage defaults and people wont be able to feed their families Civil unrest has already begun in Italy and it will go viral globally Countries need to urgently review and categorize which industries are a matter of national security or more simply put are a matter of life or death to their citizens When I stood for a seat in last Decembers UK Parliamentary elections independence restoration of democratic principles and liberty and financial conservativism were the cornerstone issues guiding my campaign Each nation state needs to rethink and recategorize its priorities The health safety and prosperity of the citizenry should be placed above identity politics the toxicity of an entitled cancel culture and mob rule by social media When taking a sober look at Brexit and my reasons for wanting to leave the European Union Covid19 provides a stark reminder that in order for a nation to survive and thrive independence not interdependence on supply chains should be priority number one Covid19 has illustrated how interdependence can cost lives Covid19 has ravaged Italy where the death rate has been oscillating between 11 and 14 These are the highest recorded mortality rates attributed to coronavirus during this crisis This is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis They need help and they need it now They called upon the EU but the cries fell upon deaf ears The only help came from Russia Last time I looked out of the 154 countries I reviewed in 2017 Italys GDP Gross Domestic Product growth over the previous 17 years was in the 152nd spot right above Haiti and Zimbabwe Italy has issued the most debt in the EU and owes around 4 trillion which as I have been warning for years Italy can never and will never repay A default is imminent The Great Financial crisis of 2008 caused Italys youth unemployment rate to skyrocket By 2014 these numbers topped 42 one of the highest in the EU as Italys debt soared Of course central bankers have the ultimate bailout solution Just follow these instructions Step 1 For Windows hit CtrlP for Apple hit Command P Step 2 Kick the can down the road Step 3 Repeat step 1 Step 4 Repeat step 1 Step 5 Pray and delay Step 6 Frantically repeat step 1 Step 7 Run for cover and shelter in place because our stupidity and hubris along with too much debt credit and leverage have crashed the global financial system These bankers policies have caused a system crash and the greatest economic depression in history is imminent The good news is since Brexit has been approved the UK will not have to pick up Italys debts or the debts of the other fiscally profligate EU member states The money saved will be spent on rebuilding industries infrastructure and supply chains to repair Britains economy The rebuilding of critical businesses will create thousands of high paying jobs across the United Kingdom at a time when employment opportunities are most needed The statements views and opinions

of responsibility remains unstable and is tending toward further escalation In these conditions the forces set up within the CSTO today have enough potential to address the set tasks At the same time special attention will be given in the future to equipping them with modern weapons and military hardware as well as command and communications systems All these issues are reflected in the CSTO military cooperation development plan for the coming five years The CSTO will continue holding military exercises to develop new forms and methods of using the collective forces which will boost the effectiveness of the tasks set for CSTO groups of troops Q Can the CSTO take part in peacekeeping operations under the UN auspices If yes are there CSTO peacekeepers in any trouble spots A As of now the CSTO peacekeeping forces have not directly participated in UN peacekeeping operations At the same time it should be noted that the CSTO peacekeeping forces generally meet the UN is key requirements and standards both in terms of their structure and in terms of their readiness to act as intended I am sure that the further strengthening of the CSTO peacekeeping resource will contribute to the organization is growing authority in the international arena For the purposes of practical interaction with the UN Department of Peace Operations the CSTO plans to invite its representatives as observers to the Unbreakable Brotherhood 2020 command post exercise involving CSTO peacekeeping forces to be held in Belarus Additionally we are planning to update the legal basis regulating the CSTO is peacekeeping activities In the interests of developing CSTO peacekeeping forces and maintaining their preparedness for performing missions including under the auspices of the UN we plan to update the structure and composition of the peacekeeping forces and train the contingents of CSTO member states in line with programs and methodology which comply with UN standards Q Does the CSTO interact with other international organization besides the UN A The CSTO Charter prescribes interaction with other international organizations Naturally the UN plays a central coordinating role and therefore serves as the key partner of the CSTO This interaction rests upon a solid foundation of laws and agreements and embraces every major area of the deterrence of modern threats and challenges The CSTO has also been actively cooperating with the Commonwealth of Independent States the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe An example of this is the participation of OSCE observers in the Channel annual regional antinarcotics operation in the CSTO The CSTO is ready for close interaction with all interested international and regional organizations operating in the field of security and views NATO as one such influential organization Q When speaking about threats to CSTO countries we usually mean the terrorist threat from Afghanistan What is the situation in the TajikAfghan border zone A It is no secret that serious losses have been inflicted on the terrorist organization ISIL banned in Russia most of Syria was liberated from militants and the terrorists command system and infrastructure were destroyed after resolute actions by the Syrian government with support and assistance from Russia However terrorists have become active in northern Afghanistan they are hatching plans to infiltrate the neighboring states of Central Asia As a result the importance of the TajikAfghan section of the external border of the CSTO states as an antiterrorist buffer has grown Extra political and military measures are being taken to stabilize the situation and interaction between regional and international organizations is being improved Military infrastructure is being created on the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan new methods for fighting terrorism drug trafficking and illegal immigration are being used and work on a draft version of the CSTO target interstate program to strengthen parts of the TajikAfghan border is being completed Q It is common knowledge that citizens of Russia Tajikistan and other CSTO member states fight among the ranks of terrorists in Afghanistan Syria and other countries How can mercenaries be countered Is it possible to thwart the activities of those who recruit them in our countries A This issue has long been in the CSTO spotlight For example the Mercenary special operation held in the CSTO format is aimed at blocking recruitment channels at entry and exit for people who might take part in terrorist activities and at neutralizing the resource base of international terrorist organizations in the CSTO space Some 100 people involved in terrorist activities were detained last year in an international operation conducted under the aegis of the CSTO more than 250000 people were checked and 61 people were placed on the international wanted list We consider it feasible to continue such operation in the future Compiling a common CSTO list of terrorist organizations is still on the agenda We hope that our partners from Armenia and Belarus will speed up the changes to their national legislations that are necessary for this Q Illegal migration undermines the national security of any state in any part of the world It leads to an increase in crimes negative trends on the labor market and upheavals in society How are the CSTO member states protected from this phenomenon A The CSTO is conducting the Illegal operation Its task is to isolate from the huge number of episodes connected to the powerful migration flows in Eurasia those that that aim to breach the law carry out criminal schemes and profit from traditionally close and diverse ties that postSoviet countries still have A number of illegal immigration routes from South and Southeast Asia to EU countries via CSTO member states were shut down last year and more than 159000 violations of migration laws were prevented in particular foreign citizens who illegally stayed in the territory of CSTO member states for a long time were tracked down Operation Illegal 2019 led to the detention of over 1000 wanted individuals and more than 8000 foreign citizens were expelled or deported from CSTO member statesadministratively Law enforcement agencies of Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Russia opened almost 7000 criminal cases oncharges of organizing illegal migration Financial monitoring agencies of Belarus and Russia detected over 2000 suspicions financial transactions conducted by foreign citizens An important result of interaction between our countries in the field of immigration is the fact that fewer attempts are being made by illegal immigrants from third countries to use the CSTO space as a transit route to countries of the European Union

of COVID19 thinks a Gazabased doctor Unable to stop its spread and desperate for solutions Hamas has turned to Israel for help It appears that Tel Aviv is happy to assist the Islamic group not only to avoid a spillover of the disease but also to avert the potential rocket fire that might follow if the situation continues to deteriorate After declaring the Gaza Strip was void of COVID19 which has killed more than 35000 people worldwide Hamas finally acknowledged that the virus has reached their territories too Initially only two people were infected by the deadly virus Those cases came from Pakistan via Egypt queuing with others at the crossing that connects the Sinai Peninsula to the enclave Those individuals as well as the people they came in direct contact with were obliged to sign a paper requiring them to quarantine themselves for 14 days Hamas has also introduced a number of other measures in order to curb the spread of the virus These included the construction of a thousand quarantine units in the northern and southern parts of the Strip the shutting down of mosques and the closing down of Gaza is crossings That however did not stop the pandemic from spreading At the end of the month the authorities were forced to acknowledge that the number of COVID19 patients has increased bringing the total to nine people so far and Rami AlAbadlah the head of the department of infectious diseases at Gaza Ministry is of Health fears the situation might continue to deteriorate due to the coastal enclave is peculiarities First of all the Strip is overcrowded housing some 18 million people ed secondly it is one of the most densely populated areas on Earth with houses built in such a way that they are in close proximity to one another and lastly Gazans tend to socialise something that can eventually lead to the infection of tens of thousands of people But these are far from being Gaza is only problems In 2009 the World Health Organisation warned of a laundy list of Gaza is medical issues These included young or inexperienced staff old tools as well as the lack of maintenance to keep new equipment working Israel is blockade of the area imposed in 2007 shortly after Hamas took over of the Strip has not helped the situation either limiting Gazans sanitation abilities and making the process of receiving medical equipment from abroad long and tedious Time has not solved any of these problems says AlAbadlah Even before the eruption of the virus Gaza is hospitals were largely understaffed Nor did they have teams of professional doctors trained to deal with such types of infections he explained Reports back up his claims According to estimates the city of Gaza with its nearly 600000 people can only offer some 60 professionals working in intensive care units ICUs whereas the number of beds in these departments only amounts to 62 The number of medical ventilators needed in case of an emergency also leaves much to be desired with the entire Strip possessing just 69 such machines Even before we talk about heavy equipment we lack the most basic and elementary items including masks disposables and hazmat suits that can guard doctors working with those patients Once the panic started masks for example have become a commodity they vanished within days says AlAbadlah Former Enemies Turned Friends Hamas is aware of the situation and the repercussions that might follow including the shattering of the group is rule if the situation is not contained The spokesman for Gaza is Ministry of Health has already appealed to international aid organisations asking for some 23 million to support the health system in the Strip In recent weeks the Jewish state has allowed the shipment of more than a thousand medical examination kits as well as hundreds of hazmat suits into the Gaza Strip expressing its willingness to cooperate with Hamas despite past tensions Although Hamas continues to slam Israel blaming it for the dire medical situation in the Strip it also seems to appreciate the gesture Since the outbreak of the pandemic Israel is south who is become accustomed to living under the fire of Hamas rockets since 2001 is now witnessing a new reality with very few rockets hitting the Jewish state is territories in recent weeks Hamas has also called off the March of Return protests that kicked off in 2018 in an attempt to force Israel to put an end to the Palestinian refugee problem indicating that the group was interested in cooperation not animosity AlAbadlah said he understood the logic behind such a cooperation If the situation gets worse in Gaza it will spill over to other areas too affecting everyone around us he said But for the Jewish state assisting Hamas is more than a question of solidarity or the prevention of a humanitarian crisis For Israel it is a question of security According Yoni BenMenachem one of Israel is leading Middle East experts Tel Aviv is concerned with the spread of the virus primarily because it might put the Islamic group into a corner If the amount of those infected continues to rise if bodies start piling up with Hamas unable to solve the recurring crisis it might have no other choice but to divert the public is attention by initiating a confrontation with Israel and this is something the Jewish state wants to avoid

chaos Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko has given an interview to Interfax correspondent Ksenia Baygarova in which he speaks about prospects for RussianEU relations after the EU leadership changed He also spoke about Russia is reaction to the possible redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons from Germany to Poland Grushko announced the upcoming visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to Russia and said that RussianTurkish partnership has remained strong despite differences Question The EU leadership changed half a year ago Back then many people in Moscow expressed cautious optimism and hope that RussianEU relations would improve Have these expectations proven true Answer Nothing has changed so far As a classic writer once said the restive steed and timid deer must neer be harnessed to one cart Let us wait and see how the thinking process develops in the European Union For now the European cart stands still perhaps because interests of various countries are colliding including where Russia is concerned There are certain politicians in particular in the Baltic states and Poland who are holding on literally by all means to the geopolitical position related to their idea of building relations with Russia as an adversary Yet there are other countries whose representatives openly admit that first of all the sanctions have not brought the desired effect in other words in the EU is language they have not changed Russia is behavior and secondly these sanctions contravene the profound interests of the European Union itself Brussels has trapped itself by linking these sanctions to the fulfilment of the Minsk Agreements Kyiv says it is not going to fulfill the Minsk Agreements and suggests various ways of interpreting them in particular claims that these are recommendations of some sort although as you know the Minsk Package of Measures was endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2202 in 2015 and became part of international law However proponents of the sanctions could not care less about these legal details Q Obviously no cancellation of sanctions can be expected in the near future But given the interest of businesses is it possible that some provisional measures will be taken until the Minsk Agreements are implemented or some kind of partial easing of sanctions A We are still realistic about the prospects I think however that strategic interests of the Europeans should prevail sooner or later It is obvious to us that if Europe wants to develop in the new polycentric world and to be not just an economic center but also a political and military one it should be interested in maintaining a normal and healthy relationship with Russia Russia is also interested in normal healthy relations with the EU that would be based on respect for each other is lawful interests and be equal As for the sanctions they have a multiplying effect for some sectors of our economy They have created fierce competition which is making businessmen and investors more efficient and competitive both in terms of organizing production and in terms of improving the quality of products We can see that businessmen have continued doing their own business despite the restrictions If we look at the number of companies that now work in Russia and I mean our main investors which are Italy France and some others it has not been falling There was no drastic fall let me put it this way Yes there were certain fluctuations but nevertheless the general presence of European businesses has remained at about the same level as it was before Another case is that the economic situation has changed because of the coronavirus and general negative changes in global trade It is no secret that according to some expert estimates just 30 of the global economy is in the green zone which is governed by clear norms and rules About 30 is in the red zone where various restrictions are used to a certain extent And approximately 30 is the uncertainty zone This uncertainty of course shackles businesses since predictability and clear rules are the key elements of fullyfledged economic cooperation By the way Kyivs ambiguity regarding the Minsk Agreements is explained by the desire to prolong sanctions against Russia for as long as possible This is how they perceive the interests of their own country Western countries just turn a blind eye to this and in various ways encourage the Kyiv authorities The majority of the EU countries are NATO members and recently the alliance made a decision to increase the status of Ukraine to the level of a partner with enhanced opportunities This is the direct encouragement of nationalist forces and the party of war in Kyiv The ball is in the EU is court and as I imagine in the longrun if we think about genuine interests of the Europeans sooner or later they will have to abandon this failed policy on Russia By the way they have made some headway towards us EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell declared the beginning of a strategic review of relations with Russia Let us wait and see how this ends Q Back in 2016 Russia came up with the initiative to take stock of relations with the European Union The EU in turn put forth five principles of developing relations with Russia linking them to the implementation of the Minsk Agreements Moscow called this position shortsighted Will Russia come up with new initiatives in relations with Europe under the new EU leadership A Those five principles were actually part of the sanctions package They cannot be called a strategy For example they say that the EU will speak with Russia only on the issues that the EU is interested in We took note of them We also converse with the EU on topics that Russia is interested in There have been no new initiatives so far Nevertheless we are one way or another in dialogue in many spheres despite the announced restrictions This primarily includes the whole range of conflicts in particular in Syria Libya as well as Ukraine since the EU is leading countries which are France and Germany are parties to the Normandy Format Consultations on Balkan issues have become regular as well We are interacting on the economy By the way Russia and the EU have a new sphere of interest namely deriving lessons from the fight against coronavirus and taking postpandemic measures After all the pandemic revealed shortcomings in the patterns of international cooperation We have made proposals as to how we should combine our efforts in the healthcare sector This also includes the development of vaccines the exchange of knowhow and supplies of equipment and medications This is important If we draw the right conclusions that we should not shut ourselves off but on the contrary should combine our efforts this would help generally improve the climate of relations between Russia and the EU I would single out digitalization and green economy among the promising new spheres for dialogue and probably even for interaction This is fresh ground in terms of international interaction and it is much better if we till it all together rather than plot by plot thus preventing unnecessary dividing lines here At the same time I cannot fail to recall how we were perplexed by the campaign launched in the West when we began providing assistance in opposing coronavirus to Italy Serbia Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries We were reproached because it was said that Moscow was trying to take advantage of faults in cooperation between the European Union and NATO countries in order to gain some geopolitical advantages and disunite Europe This was an absolutely unjust and blatant campaign In fact we did not advertise our efforts much and helped those who asked for our assistance We gave what we were really able to give keeping in mind our pressing need for example for ventilators test kits medicals masks and medicines The line of my duty made me address issues related to Russian military humanitarian mission in Italy My hair stood on end when I read European press Allegedly this was Russia is secret operation seeking military penetration into Italy and then securing a stronghold there Horrible It looked as if it was possible to get into Italy one of the most open countries in the world only under the disguise of a military doctor wearing a chemical protection suit a mask and glasses The Italians themselves were stigmatized in the EU and NATO for accepting Russia is aid And the story was very simple The Italian prime minister asked our president for help It was given And it was given in full interaction with the receiving party When the tasks were fulfilled in an orchestrated manner we left within two days Q Politicians in Europe have been speaking more often in favor of creating EU is own army as the EU is own troops that are not affiliated with NATO would bolster Europe is independence and reduce Europe is dependence on the United States Do you think these plans are realistic And in general does Moscow see antiRussian attitudes in the EU is military activity A We understand that the Europeans need to be autonomous and independent in security issues The bipolar structure of international relations is gone It was one situation when Europe was part of the transAtlantic half of the bipolar standoff But now if the EU wants to be a center of political and economic influence it will obviously seek to possess the relevant potential in the field of military security We have said on many occasions that we understand the objective reasons that prompt Europeans to progress towards their defense identity and independence in this area Importantly this progress should not follow the Cold War patterns and should not create new dividing lines Such a risk exists NATO is trying to take charge of the process and subjugate it for the purpose of defending against the threat coming from the East in other words Russia Q Many Western politicians reproach Russia for attempts to drive a wedge between the EU and the US A It is the United States that is trying to drive a wedge into transAtlantic unity as it views Europe as its colony and tells it which countries to trade with and not to trade with and which to buy gas from and which not to It not only threatens but also imposes sanctions on its own allies The United States either leaves or destroys arms control agreements which have fundamental significance for its closest partners Europeans are publicly complaining that the Trump administration has monetized Article 5 of the Washington Treaty which in their opinion is sacrosanct It is not Russia that forces European countries to spend 2 of their GDP on military needs or to buy American weapons So let those alleging that Russia is attempting to drive a wedge look at themselves in the mirror Q But do geopolitical differences between Europe and the US play into Russia is hands A What does it mean into Russia is hands Russia for many reasons is interested in normal relations with the US and Europe Let me remind that in better times RussianEU trade stood at 417 billion and back then of course our share in the global GDP was less significant For example the figure stood at 500600 billion as far as China and the US are concerned And those are close figures So from the point of view of trade and economic ties relations with Russia were of strategic importance for the EU We are not going to give this up Yes indeed we have been investing in the development of the Eurasian Economic Union EAEU lately and have been rapidly developing our foreign trade and economic relations in the East But this is the objective reality and demand because economic growth drivers are moving eastwards and this is the general trend But this does not mean that we are turning our back on Europe and not just because we are bound by railroads gas and oil pipelines but also because we are tied together by common history culture and finally geography We believe that the EU is real interest cannot be about cultivating hostile relations with Russia Q Many people fear today that after Russia passed the constitutional amendment on the priority of the national law over the international it will cease to fulfil decisions of the European Court of Human Rights ECHR The Venice Commission has already expressed concerns to this end A This is not about the fulfillment or nonfulfillment of judgements Of course the ECHR will continue working and accepting claims from Russian citizens However we will be complying with these judgements as much as they comply with the Russian Constitution There is nothing unusual about that Such provisions exist in the legislation of many countries among them Finland Georgia Albania Serbia Germany the United Kingdom Italy and Austria Here is one of the latest examples On May 20 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany said that it was impossible to fulfill the decision of the EU Court of Justice on the legality of the public sector purchase program of the European Central Bank citing considerable excess of competences vested to the EU court This situation is not linked to the ECHR but it serves as an example from the point of view of national and international law Recent years have shed light on the problem of Western countries exercising their majority to attribute to international organizations functions that go beyond their statutory documents In particular the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW Technical Secretariat created an attribution mechanism Should we take a legal path such a mechanism could have been created only through amending the Chemical Weapons Convention and through ratification by all participating states if they agree But in this case this is done through simple voting And then attribution mechanisms emerge and these attribution mechanism are not provided in documents they contradict the very nature of these international instruments and they replace national competences in the sphere of assessing compliance or noncompliance with conventions or treaties just as they replace the prerogatives of UN resolutions So some kind of institutions created by unlawful means some kind of experts will point at countries saying that they do not comply with something and at the same time as part of some Western associations develop unlawful sanctions instruments which can be immediately put to use on command from the mechanisms controlled by the West How can we accept that Q But coming back to the ECHR For example a Russian citizen after being released from prison is awarded compensation from Russia in the ECHR Will this keep on working after the Russian Constitution is amended A The fact that we have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms makes it part of our domestic legislation Q So nothing will change A It will change by ruling out legal practice collisions between ECHR judgements and the norms of the Russian Constitution There are loads of cases in which participating states declare their inability to fulfill judgements either completely or partially because they contravene particular constitutional provisions By the way if we speak about the European Convention on Human Rights the nonparticipation of the EU as a supranational organization in this convention is a considerable gap The negotiations have been ongoing for several years but the cart is still there At the same time joining other Council of Europe conventions the EU insists on socalled disconnection clauses meaning that the convention is provisions are fulfilled only when they comply with EU laws including their possible changes In fact this leads to the fragmentation of conventions of the Council of Europe and EU institutions fall outside the scope of the European Convention on Human Rights Q The Netherlands has recently filed a lawsuit with the ECHR against Russia over the MH17 crash At the same time it expressed readiness for negotiations with Russia on this matter Could you comment on this Is Moscow in consultations on such issues with the Netherlands Australia and Belgium Is Russia ready to pay compensation to the injured party And in general what is your assessment of the MH17 trial A We are following the trial and unfortunately the legal proceedings and now the stated intention to turn to the European Court of Human Rights ECHR show that The Hague is continuing to keep to the version of events initially chosen according to which Russia was appointed the guilty party before the evidence was collected As for consultations with the Netherlands and Australia we have had them on legal issues but they have no relation to the direct work of the court Q Just recently Russia and NATO resumed discussions at the level of chiefs of general staff Is it possible that political contacts at other levels of the NATORussia Council NRC will resume A We have made no decisions on rupturing relations with NATO Political dialogue was and is upheld be it even outside formal NRC meetings For example there are contacts between Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and the NATO Military Committee chairman They had a telephone conversation recently Occasionally about once in six months the Russian chief of general staff meets NATO is Supreme Allied Commander Europe who is also US European Commander The NRC has also met But the thing is that there are no topics for discussions The NRC was convened to overview the security horizon and to preemptively expose common threats and challenges It also considered options and ways of cooperating in neutralizing these threats keeping in mind the activity of other organizations so as not to duplicate them This means it sought the niches where all NRC members can have common vision of what should be done Q And there is no such common vision right now A There is no vision but presentday threats have not gone away they have just become more acute For example Afghanistan We were cooperating well on stabilization there Very significant projects were implemented One of the largest is the fight against drugs More than 3000 officers for antinarcotics services of Afghanistan Pakistan and Central Asian countries were trained under NRC auspices But now cooperation the fight against piracy and fight against terrorism has been wound down The last thing that was addressed in the NRC was the launch of the NRCs first ever joint operation to ensure safety of scrapping chemical weapons taken from Syria However NATO decided that Russia must be punished and gave up any cooperating It shot itself in the foot Q But NATO and Russia have many questions for each other that arouse concerns Are these issues addressed in the NRC A The main challenge in RussiaNATO relations in the practical sphere is preventing dangerous incidents and not misreading each other is intentions which means deescalation Leaders of NATO member states constantly speak about it Who would argue We are ready for substantive dialogue but it cannot be held without the military NATO decided to rupture all military ties except for the channel of the chiefs of general staff With due respect to ambassadors it is not for them to discuss what a safe distance between ships and aircraft should be and what frequencies pilots should use to communicate when approaching each other Moreover NATO always insists that the Ukrainian issue must be discussed which is nonsense given the role of the OSCE and given that there is the Normandy Format which brings together two NATO member states So we are ready for substantive work but By the way last year saw two NRC meeting which discussed military security and a very serious problem which is the fate of the INF Treaty because it affects the security of NRC members We assume that such discussions should move us along the right path otherwise the dialogue will be impaired Q Do you see as real a possibility of redeploying nuclear weapons from Germany to Poland What would Russia is actions be if this plan comes to fruition keeping in mind that this would be a breach of the RussiaNATO Founding Act A We are following this very closely The RussiaNATO Founding Act nails down the rigid obligation of the alliance is member states not to change the configuration and the geography of deploying nuclear weapons and relevant infrastructure Of course we would like to hope that this obligations will be observed But actions of the US administration to put it mildly somewhat broaden the understanding of the boundaries of the possible So there is no certainty If we see any progress towards making concrete plans or relevant preparations we will take every precaution including military necessary to ensure security Q So Russia will quit the Founding Act A I think that would be a death sentence on this document Q It turns out that the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe CFE Treaty is ruined There is no more the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces INF Treaty The US withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty The New START Treaty is on its last legs And now the Founding Act Does this mean chaos in the arms control sphere How should we overcome it A Yes there is chaos And chaos is where the United States is heading If we talk about pillars on which the European military security system was based just look at the American policy of the past few years The US disrupted the ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty the cornerstone of European security as its preamble goes Then they quit the INF Treaty after all it seemed that no one would lift a hand against it Now spontaneous withdrawal from the Treaty on Open Skies And if what you are talking about the redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons takes place this might be the coup de grace So far there are no detailed agreements to this end but hints that such scenarios may take place Keeping in mind the shameless way the US acts disregarding anyone interests such a possibility cannot be ruled out Q Could Russia in this case redeploy tactical nuclear weapons closer to NATO borders A All necessary measures will be taken As we have said before there will be no deployment on our part if there are no US intermediate and shorterrange missiles in Europe As soon as those missiles emerge we will deploy ours The countries that are practically fighting for any form of US military presence and the status of frontline states I mean Poland and the Baltic states should be aware of the cost of this choice for their own security and their allies Q Is Russia engaged in any discussions with NATO Does it seek explanations over the reinforcement of the missile defense component in Poland A We had discussions previously There even were initiatives to create joint missile defense But what can be discussed here today The plans are being implemented and a missile base armed with MK41 launchers is due to open in the territory of Poland in 2021 That will break the balance even further and will create a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation especially as the Americans tested groundlaunched cruise missiles just two weeks after their withdrawal from the INF Treaty The problem is just getting more acute The system is already ready in Romania MK41 launchers have been installed there these are universal launchers that could fire various types of missiles The same MK41 launchers are installed on board US ships armed with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System They can also load Tomahawks ie intermediaterange missiles Naturally all those factors are taken into account in the defense planning process Q How would you assess the implementation of the initiative to use transponders for military flights over the Baltic Sea A There has been one ray of light in the gloomy RussianNATO relationship it appeared when a Baltic Sea project team for air safety was set up under the NATORussia Council is auspices involving Russia NATO representatives Finland Sweden and the Baltic countries This resulted in an agreement on an international offairway route between St Petersburg and Kaliningrad which was certified by all countries in the area of responsibility of which it lies It has become an official route recognized by Eurocontrol The use of this route by Russian government aircraft primarily military ones makes it possible to send out flight plans beforehand and use transponders Civil air traffic controllers can see aircraft that fly this route on their radars This is a significant improvement of the situation in term of eradicating risks for commercial aircraft as air traffic is very dense in this region This shows clearly that when experts are engaged and parties take a depoliticized approach some tangible results can be attained no matter how modest they may be At the same time we have questions for NATO member states Even when our planes follow this route with their transponders on NATO fighters keep intercepting them Q Is the idea of dispatching a UN mission to ensure the security of OSCE mission in Ukraine still relevant In general how would you assess the activity of the OSCE mission A No this idea has stopped being relevant It was put forward by Petro Poroshenko when he was Ukrainian president We agreed because in contrast to the UN the OSCE does not have a weapon arm All of its missions are unarmed This is a monitoring and assistance mission At one point Poroshenko said that the security of the mission is officers should be ensured No one threatens them today We support the activity of the OSCE mission and believe that it is exercising a very important function But speaking of the essence of the problem this is not about the mission and the way it operates but about Kyiv is unwillingness to make progress on the path of settlement and fulfillment of the Minsk Agreements in the political and security spheres Q Could you confirm that the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to Russia is being prepared When could it take place A Indeed an agreement on Macron is visit to Russia has been reached in principle The time has yet to be set It can be assumed that out of international affairs the entire range of strategic stability issues the arms control situation in the broadest sense of this word European security and of course the situation in every existing hotbed such as Libya and Syria will be discussed The relevance of these issues increases in the context of the recent events The issues have become part of the fabric of the RussianFrench dialogue at the highest and other levels Q There is an impression that despite all the positive moments RussianTurkish relations are an alliance of convenience rather than strategic partnership primarily keeping in mind differences on the Middle East Do you allow for a situation in which for example Ankara is actions in Libya or Syria would cause a black cat cross the path of bilateral relations A Id rather not view RussiaTurkey relations outside the general context of international relations which are not in very good shape As collective principles weaken politics starts shifting to alliances of convenience There is a history of RussianTurkish relations It is well known and has its fair share of black cats On the other hand much headway has been made in building a strategic partnership thanks to the efforts of the two presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan If you take a look at the content of bilateral relations which embraces the economy energy and humanitarian contacts you can hardly miss the fact that they rest upon a solid foundation Obviously there are elements of positive interdependence Such projects as for instance TurkStream and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant influence the very nature of relations Yes we acknowledge that Russia and Turkey may pursue different interests in particular in the Middle East But do not forget that it was Russia and Turkey that managed to create with the assistance of Iran the Astana format which is currently laying down the key principles of the Syrian settlement process Despite all nuances of the national stances difficulties and different viewpoints we maintain the strategic unity in the issue of Syria is future and believe that this should be a single indivisible nation within the current borders and that the Syrians themselves should decide their future This is very important We manage to come to an understanding despite any disagreements If we speak about the fabric of the political dialogue it is hard for me to tell what other countries have such close practically daily contacts with us These are not just unparalleled in terms of the intensity of contacts between the leaders but also contacts on the ground our servicemen jointly run patrol missions in Idlib and near the SyrianTurkish border We have come a long way and have achieved much and although we have disagreements we are absolutely open to discussing them Q What actions will Russia take if the US buys Russia is S400 systems from Turkey A This is impossible Any standard contract includes a clause on the end user Such systems are never sold if there is an understanding that they might be resold Q Could you please comment on the decision of the Turkish authorities to change the status of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul A We regret it There are just a few symbols of the modern world with the history running through centuries and the influence they had on our evolution They all require the most careful and respectful attitude The cathedral is in Turkey but without any exaggeration it is a common heritage It is the historical spiritual interreligious and cultural significance that made Hagia Sophia a world heritage site protected by UNESCO We hope that all obligations regarding the status of this cathedral its administration preservation and access to it will be fully met

freeze in US North Korean dialogue Russian Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora has given an interview to Interfax in which he speaks about prospects for resuming dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington the current situation in North Korea as well as Moscow is assistance to Pyongyang Question North Korea has set a kind of a deadline urging the United States to fulfill its part of obligations and ease sanctions in exchange to disarmament steps that Pyongyang had already taken There have been no tangible actions on Washington is behalf Do you see signs that North Korea has turned its back on the negotiations with the US and that the dialogue has once again reached a stalemate Answer You are not rendering absolutely correctly the essence of demands that Pyongyang put forth before and is putting now Let is start with what was in 2019 Chairman of the State Affairs Council Kim Jong Un in his political speech at the session of the DPRK is Supreme People is Assembly in April conditioned the resumption of the dialogue with a new calculation method that the Americans should propose and start implementing in the period left before the end of 2019 Detailed explanations regarding what Pyongyang thinks this new calculation method to be were offered to the Americans on the sidelines of the USNorth Korean summit in Panmunjom on June 30 If previously Pyongyang had been ready for a kind of an exchange where each North Korea is step towards denuclearization is accompanied by appropriate Washington is actions for example the lifting of some sanctions the North Korean leadership categorically rejected this scheme after Hanoi It was said that there would be no more bargaining To put it short the Americans must now not only give up enmity towards the DPRK but also prove this with certain actions Only after this Pyongyang is ready to come to the negotiating table In fact an ultimatum dealing with the complete reformatting of the basic approaches to the settlement of the nuclear problem of the Korean Peninsula was put forward And here we got an emotional decision likely to be explained by deep Vietnamese disappointment The failure of the American North Korean consultations in Stockholm on October 5 clearly showed on the one hand Washington is unpreparedness to accept the new pattern and on the other hand Pyongyang is determination to adhere to it Nevertheless Pyongyang kept its promise and kept the pause and took no serious actions until the end of the year although the US did not send any significant signal but calls to resume the dialogue and vague hints that it is ready to meet the North halfway in some things In the last days of 2019 the fifth plenum of the Seventh Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea took place It summed up disappointing results of the Korean détente initiated by the Korean leadership in 2018 and made a conclusion that it had become clear that the US aggressive policy towards the DPRK and sanctions against the country is an objective reality that would last forever It was followed by an official statement on January 11 the first one this year by North Korean Foreign Ministry advisor Kim Kye Gwan There was a phrase that absolutely clearly reflects Pyongyang is position The resumption of the KoreanUS dialogue is only possible on the condition of full acceptance of our terms by Washington However we clearly understand that it is not ready for it and moreover is unable to do so This understanding of the situation is the foundation of the new political course the socalled frontal breakthrough endorsed by the plenary meeting It implies that the country will concentrate on domestic affairs and will reinstate the socalled parallel variant which was in effect before 2018 developing the civil economy while strengthening defense capabilities As for the dialogue with Washington which they deem to be pointless for now it seems to have been postponed at least until after the US presidential election They shall see what happens next Q Earlier the North Korean leader said that Pyongyang would soon present a totally new kind of weapons that will change the status of North Korea Moreover Pyongyang changed the foreign minister Experts explained these as North Korean step to wind down the dialogue with the US How does Moscow in general treat these Pyongyang is signals A As far as the North Korean problem is concerned it is very important to give precise quotes Kim Jong Un said at the last December plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea which I have already mentioned that the world will see new strategic weapon of North Korea soon enough One can only guess what it is however one should keep in mind that any country has the sovereign right to strengthen its defense capacity And it was widely discussed here in Pyongyang that North Korea got a new strategic status after the test of a ballistic missile on November 29 2017 which foreign experts based on parameters of its flight made known classified as an intercontinental one Speaking of Ri Son Gwon is appointment as the new foreign minister Id rather not link it directly to the adjustment of the policy on the US track The foreign minister has never been a significant actor in the dialogue with representatives of Washington The issue of relations with the US and their derivative the nuclear problem has always been the area of the first deputy foreign minister To our knowledge Choe Son Hui remains in charge of this area Naturally the policy she is carrying out on the US track is not her own but strictly follows the course set by the chief of state Clearly Moscow cannot be happy with the deep freeze in US North Korean dialogue which is fraught with an escalation of tensions in the region adjacent to our Far Eastern border We expect the negotiations to resume sooner or later and as they say are ready to stretch out a helping hand to Pyongyang and Washington In this context we continue to promote our plan of action prepared together with the Chinese colleagues to ensure a comprehensive settlement of the situation on the Korean Peninsula Q Is the issue of easing sanctions against North Korea amid the coronavirus pandemic on the agenda Or is the principal position of the US that Pyongyang is steps are insufficient for any exemptions still a stumbling block for the consideration of this issue in the UN Security Council Do restrictions hinder the supplies of medical equipment to the DPRK A The issue of easing sanctions amid the pandemic and not only with regards to the DPRK but also other countries whose population is suffering from these restrictions was put forth by a group of countries at the UN General Assembly session on March 26 2020 however the US and its allies who as it is widely known are the main champions of human rights blocked adoption of a decision to this end It seems that the Americans themselves were unable to formulate what they considered to be sufficient moves that would waive objections as far as easing restrictions is concerned However they seriously impede the supplies of medicines and medical equipment We are as it is said present on the spot and get a lot of confirmations that direct bans very negatively impact this situation for example as far as equipment for treating cancer is concerned just as the situation in which the Americans in fact pursue anyone who has any trade relations with the DPRK even if we talk about absolutely harmless things Q According to statement by North Korean authorities there are no Covid19 cases in North Korea In your opinion how realistic and accurate are these statements Does Pyongyang inform you about the pandemic A I must say that the North Korean administration undertook the most resolute and firm measures to prevent that infection from penetrating the country And it was done before anyone else did so Even China was keeping its borders open when they imposed travel restrictions in late January and completely locked the border in early February Since then it became absolutely impossible to arrive in the country even for North Korean residents staying abroad still none of them is able to come home as known residents returning from abroad are the main source of infection in any country Border provinces which have the closest relations with China have been isolated from the rest of the country just like Pyongyang which was visited by Chinese tourists in January As for persons who arrived before the start of the epidemic in China including foreign citizens they were put under obligatory 30day quarantine and were daily checked by medical teams for one month after that As early as in February everyone was wearing a mask temperature was taken at the doorstep of every institution and every residential building and hands and footwear were sanitized In the middle of February schoolchildren and students were completely isolated and that regime was eased only in early May Some other exemptions can now be seen in the country We were allowed to go to markets and all major shopping malls imports have more or less resumed but there is no international passenger traffic and masks and total disinfection remain obligatory We know that foreign experts doubt the reliability of information about the absence of Covid19 cases here and say that preventive measure would be unnecessary in complete isolation if North Korea actually had no infections However local infectionists have different logic They say that coronavirus is extremely bad and the ways of its transmission as well as pathogenic and other features have yet to be fully studied So theyd better stay cautious and take no risk By the way I have spoken with a European diplomat who also doubted that the North Korean authorities were telling the whole truth I dared him to give at least one reason why such information would be concealed and he gave me two he said the North Korean authorities did not want to tell the foreign audience about their problems for the image is sake and secondly did not want to scare the population for fear of panic I strongly disagreed with him Pyongyang does not hesitate to provide the WHO and international humanitarian organizations with comprehensive information about local diseases such as tuberculosis and dysentery and receives substantial assistance in their treatment Why should coronavirus be any different As for panic no one fears it here as the local public is monolithic and extremely disciplined By the way it is much more stress resistant than any Western society In general given what I have said I am inclined to trust the reports regarding the absence of infection in North Korea I have lately had a number of meetings with heads of the North Korean Foreign Ministry including the minister and his deputy and the issue of coronavirus was high on our agenda Q China Russia and international organization provided aid to North Korea in combating the spread of the coronavirus Was the supplied aid enough Does North Korea need more similar supplies against the pandemic backdrop A To our knowledge the country independently provides itself with masks and disinfectants I believe that things are not so good with medications and ventilators The supply of these goods would be proper and relevant The primary objective is to prevent coronavirus from penetrating the country North Korea has been quite successful in doing so Q Will Russia keep oil and petrochemical supplies to North Korea at the same level despite the coronavirus pandemic or they will be cut A We do not supply oil to North Korea while we resumed the export of petrochemicals in the amount of 20003000 tonnes monthly after a pause caused by antiviral actions This is roughly last year is level While doing that we are strictly complying with the requirements of relevant UN Security Council resolutions including regular notification of the Sanctions Committee on the amount of our shipments Q Earlier this year you said that the issue of supplying a large batch of wheat to North Korea from Russia after a bad harvest in 2019 was being considered Is there an understanding when such supplies may begin and what amount is in question What other assistance are we going to provide to Pyongyang in the near future A The first batch of Russian wheat amounting to 25000 tonnes was supplied to North Korea as humanitarian aid this May It was a timely action considering the beginning of the socalled barley hump here in June This is the period of the most serious grain shortage last year is stock is low and the new harvest has yet to begin winter barley is harvested in the north of the Korean Peninsula in June Hopefully we will be able to supply more wheat soon North Korea appreciates this gratis assistance for a number of reasons including the severe drought of last year it does not have enough grain Q According to the Russian Foreign Ministry as of late January there were about 1000 former North Korean workers who were to go home Has the pandemic hindered their return Have former North Korean workers who failed to go home remained in Russia A As I said given the complete closure of borders North Korean citizens who were staying abroad as of late January are still unable to return to the home country North Korean workers staying in Russia found themselves in the same situation Q The North Korean leader was invited to attend the Victory Parade in Moscow that was to take place on May 9 and that was rescheduled because of the pandemic Has the North Korean side informed Moscow of the level at which it was expected to be represented at this event Was Kim Jong Un going to visit the Russian capital Is there an understanding what will be the level of the representation of North Korea after the new date of the parade is announced A I would like to ask you to address this question to the Russian presidential administration Q One cannot fail to ask about the recent widely speculated disappearance of Kim Jong Un who as it is known has reemerged in public In your opinion what was the constant discussion of the North Korean leader is health and elaboration of various theories aimed at Was it an attempt to destabilize the situation in North Korea A I should say I believe it is wrong to discuss the health condition of the North Korean leader The wild allegations made in this regard evoke quite negative feelings to put it mildly I do not think it is a purposeful campaign aimed to destabilize the republic Few people inside the country knew what US newspapers were writing about and what South Korean deputies were saying on those days Most likely it was a fantasy of unscrupulous individuals who wanted their minute of glory and those speculations were disseminated by mass media outlets which are greedy for sensations and pardon my tautology are highly unscrupulous

The coronavirus nonworking holiday in Russia will be extended until April 30 President Vladimir Putin announced in his second pandemicrelated address to the nation Experts say that the fight against the virus may lead to a tenpercent drop in the countrys GDP but the enforced vacation extension will help control the spread of COVID19 Izvestia writes It is hard to say at the moment if we will be able to break the chain of infections by extending the nonworking period Those who contracted the virus before the lockdown may emerge over this time said Alexander Lukashev Director of First Moscow State Medical Universitys Martsinovsky Institute of Medical Parasitology Tropical and Vector Borne Diseases It wont be possible to cut all contacts between people because there are businesses and organizations that cannot suspend their activities including medical facilities Anna Oreshkova an infectious disease doctor explained However in her words these measures are necessary because the healthcare system could explode if everyone fell ill simultaneously Experts need to analyze trends in order to figure out if the virus spread is declining Virology Professor at Moscow State Universitys Department of Biology Alexei Agranovsky pointed out According to him conclusions and forecasts should by no means be made after only a few days of observation Meanwhile the economy is estimated to lose nearly one trillion rubles 13 bln following the first weekoff said Pavel Sigal First Vice President of the Opora Rossii organization In his view it is the small and midsized

Institute According to him in the face of great uncertainty it is hard to tell how the economic situation will develop XXX Nezavisimaya Gazeta Washington blames pandemic on Beijing Beijing hid the scope of the coronavirus outbreak in China and downplayed the death toll depriving the world of the opportunity to promptly take protective measures an intelligence report handed to the White House says According to experts recent data on the number of infections and deaths in the United States has made it clear that the coronavirus pandemic has effected the country more than China which is making Washington step up its propaganda war Nezavisimaya Gazeta notes Meanwhile according to the Western media Chinese diplomats are not going to avoid harsh rhetoric in debates with foreign opponents after Chinas leader Xi Jinping had ordered them to show more fighting spirit There is a widespread perception among common people in China that America seeks to prevent their countrys power from growing So when diplomats rebuke the US over issues such as the coronavirus and the Hong Kong protests it resonates with the Chinese Vladimir Batyuk Chief Research Associate at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute for the US and Canadian Studies believes that Washingtons information blitz against Beijing is directly linked to the American presidential election campaign The coronavirus has smashed it all Until recently few doubted that Donald Trump would be the triumphant one But the epidemic has put him in a zugzwang position where like in the game of chess every next move makes things worse If Trump continues to combat the virus the most populous regions of the US will have to face a lockdown which will deal a harsh blow to the economy In the situation of an economic crisis the incumbent president will have slim chances of being reelected There is also another option Trump can say that the country has enough of lockdown and needs to get back to work He already said that on March 24 but he had to take his words back later because leaving the epidemic uncontained would have had terrible consequences and it would have also undermined his chances for reelection This is why an attempt to blame China or someone else looks completely understandable since it fits in with the logic of the election race the expert emphasized XXX Izvestia NATO struggles to adapt to pandemic The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has succeeded in adapting to the climate created by the coronavirus pandemic and continues efforts to ensure security NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said following a videoconference of NATO foreign ministers Experts interviewed by Izvestia point out that the statement is nothing but an attempt to make an appearance amid the pandemic Its not entirely correct to say that the coronavirus has not affected NATOs activities In March the alliance had to reconsider the agenda of the Defender 2020 military exercise which was expected to become its biggest postColdWar military game in Europe NATO remains first and foremost a military and political bloc which seeks to accomplish strategic tasks though strengthening its military presence The alliances expansion is part of that line said Elena Ponomareva a professor from the Department of Comparative Political Science at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations The alliance could be more active in the situation of an epidemiological disaster but it does not have a humanitarian aspect she added When global healthcare issues take center stage the need arises to redistribute funds thereby reducing defense spending Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council RIAC Andrey Kortunov pointed out The publics attention has shifted to more important security challenges Voters in both Europe and the US are inevitably starting to ask why spend so much money on NATO when there is the coronavirus threat the expert concluded NATO officials are showing off their activities in a bid to reaffirm financial and political priorities that the West had established in recent years Kortunov explained XXX Kommersant Donbass republics accuse Kiev of disrupting prisoner exchange Officials in the selfproclaimed Donbass republics have published lists of prisoners they were ready to hand over to Kiev in exchange for their detainees The Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics DPR LPR accuse Kiev and Ukrainian President Zelenskys chief of staff Andrei Yermak personally of undermining the prisoner swap plans The publication of the prisoner lists is aimed at putting pressure on the Ukrainian authorities who have recently abandoned some provisional agreements Kommersant wrote Talks on prisoner swaps between Kiev and Moscow as well as between Kiev and the Donbass republics have always been uneasy but successful as a rule However neither of the parties have published prisoner lists before to shame the other side and force it to make concessions Its unlikely that the Donbass republics decided to make such a move without consulting Russia Following the March 26 videoconference Moscow made it clear that it was frustrated by changes in Kievs position on previously agreed on decisions Senior Researcher at the Russian State University for the Humanities Department of PostSoviet Countries Alexander Gushchin pointed out that DPR and LPR officials want to put the spotlight on the Ukrainian leaderships unwillingness to take crucial steps to achieve peace in Donbass Until recently Andrei Yermak kept saying that elections in Donbass might take place in the fall at the same time as local Ukrainian elections but now when plans to create an advisory council and carry out a prisoner exchange have failed it seems not just unlikely but absolutely impossible the expert told the newspaper The publication of the prisoner lists will not necessarily produce a serious backlash over the situation However it is another effort by the Donbass republics to reaffirm their identity and point to Kievs weakness as Ukraine is entering another stage of its struggle for political survival Gushchin emphasized XXX Rossiyskaya Gazeta Vendors giving away flowers on Moscow streets Floral vendors have started to give away roses and tulips on Moscows streets Flower shops closed in accordance with the mayors decree and are unable to sell their remaining flowers Instead of tossing them in the trash vendors are trying to make women happier amid the current lockdown Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports The flower giveaway is an act of charity and also a move to bid farewell to small businesses that took an incredible amount of effort time and money to build It is a common situation these days because many businesses us included are just

delivery services and are now selling the remaining flowers at a discount of 3050 Once it is all over many shops will not reopen Zhilokov pointed out According to him rental payments are the main problem Many landlords are unwilling to make concessions and want their money regardless of virus outbreaks and natural disasters Besides there are loans and employee wages to pay Given the lockdown businesses just cant afford it all Zhilokov explained The National Flower Growers Association in turn believes that it is high time for the government to support local producers Italian flower growers have already asked the government to offset their losses the association is head Alexei Antipov noted We would also like to ask for support he added TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in

a curfew from 6pm to 6am as of March 25 Syria braces itself for a potential medical crisis The Syrian healthcare sector has been crippled under a maximum pressure economic sanctions campaign that has collectively punished the Syrian people for the duration of a war waged against them by the same governments inflicting the catastrophic economic damage Hospitals and medical care centers have been targeted and occupied by the extremist armed groups throughout Syria further reducing the Syrian stateability to deal with the looming threat of an apparently rapacious pandemic Sanctions increase the risk of pandemic spread All measures taken against the Syrian government by the UK US and EU are ostensibly to protect the Syrian people Of course sanctions never protect the people they deprive the people of basic needs they decimate essential infrastructure They are designed to weaken the target state or leadership to turn the people against the government to serve USled foreign policy agendas in the region Sanctions enable war and destruction they are taken to bring resistant nations into line with horrifying consequences for the civilian population The US is taking action to sanction Assad regime Lt General Ayoub for the violence perpetuated against the people of northern Syria Such violence that impacts civilians humanitarian workers and hospitals must not be tolerated We stand on the side of the Syrian people Secretary Pompeo SecPompeo March 17 2020 Instead of lifting sanctions to allow nations like Iran and Syria to combat what is described as a global pandemic that threatens the lives of all Syrians and Iranians according to the media hype the USled coalition of humanitarian intervention is effectively doubling down on their prosanction prowar rhetoric as a recent statement from the UK US France and Germany has demonstrated Former UK Ambassador to Syria Peter Ford described the statement as a thinly veiled cry of solidarity for AlQaeda in Syria There is not a word here with which Hayat Tahrir Ash Sham the dominant jihadi group would not concur White Helmets weaponize Covid19 to ensure Syrian people suffer more The AlQaedalinked White Helmets group have sprung into action to defend the sanctions regime and to effectively condemn the huge majority of Syrian people to further misery should the pandemic take hold in Syria An organisation with a history of collaboration with the US Coalitionsponsored armed groups in Syria itself funded by the same governments has been triggered by the billionairemanufactured PR complex that manages and directs this shadow state construct We have seen a flurry of activity on their Twitter accounts their primary platform promoting the White Helmet coronavirus campaign This is nothing short of cynical exploitation of a world crisis to weaponize it against the Syrian government via an entity that has served this purpose since its establishment in Turkey by a former British military intelligence officer James Le Mesurier The White Helmets have published a statement calling for sanctions against Syria to be maintained The statement is based on misinformation and duplicitous narratives including the claim that Syria and Russia are deliberately targeting hospitals omitting that these hospitals are invariably taken over by the Al Qaedadominated armed groups in areas they control converted into terrorist triage centers prisons courts military centers and torture chambers Raed Saleh the leader of the White Helmets was recently given a platform in the Senate to feed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the talking points that it should adopt Salehs highly politicized speech is echoed in his tweet instrumentalising the coronavirus crisis to further amplify the talking points historically and fraudulently used to criminalize the Syrian government while airbrushing Nusra FrontAlQaeda from the Syrian conflict landscape White Helmets are neither neutral nor humanitarian So in summary the White Helmets a supposedly neutral humanitarian organisation are sustaining their donors maximum pressure campaign against the Syrian people they claim to support If the White Helmets were anything other than an extremist propaganda construct implementing the US Coalition regime change policy against Syria they would have demanded a ban on sanctions to enable the country to collectively deal with the coronavirus crisis Three things stand out in this tweet 1 A gullible Kelly Craft falling hard for the WhiteHelmets deception 2 Standard WHelmets child abuse 3 A photo of Craft with a caption that plays to her ego Al Qaeda in disguise continues to win American hearts minds Syria Walid walid970721 March 24 2020 The White Helmet organisation should be condemned for effectively enabling mass suffering and death in Syria not only by providing cover for internationally designated terrorist groups but now for endorsing sanctions that will ensure the perfect

joined the hundreds of others on our street and the millions across Scotland and the UK to applaud bang pots and pans and compress car horns for the frontline health and care workers who face the dangerous battle against COVID19 daily It is a small act of solidarity with and appreciation for ordinary men and women who do extraordinary tasks in their line of duty to care for the victims of this horrible virus and protect the rest of us from contracting it We salute every one of those workers However before going to my garden last night I watched the evening news bulletins and heard much talk from politicians about getting back to normal Tory Health Minister Matt Hancock talked about it last week as well and it made me think and reflect on what these politicians actually mean What is normal to them Like everyone else with children I am anxious about my daughter is education and want her back at school as soon as safely possible I want to be able to hug and kiss my elderly mum during my brief visits to her home to prepare food for her I want to spend time with my sisters and inlaws and socialise together the way we used to every other weekend I want to get back to regular 7 a side games with my mates and games of badminton and tennis at the local sports centre I want to feel the buzz of entering Celtic Park to cheer on the best team in Scotland I want to return to the forms of socialising we all took for granted before the covid19 lockdown Going for a meal shopping seeing a movie We are social animals We thrive on socialising That is a normal I want to embrace once again as soon as possible But that is not the only normal the politicians have in mind When they talk of normal they really mean the way society was ordered before the covid19 crisis and that is why I want to roar loudly and passionately that what we had before was not normal and under no circumstances should we aspire to get back to it It was not normal for hundreds of thousands of fellow human beings to be homeless and forced to sleep rough on our streets As of March 2019 84740 households are stuck in temporary accommodation up more than 75 percent since December 2010 where the use of BBs and hotels to put up hardup families hit its lowest point since 2004 Shockingly Shelter estimate there will be 135000 children living in temporary accommodation by Christmas 2019 It was not normal for fourteen million citizens across the UK to be living in poverty and struggling daily to survive on inadequate benefits or poverty pay with almost sixty percent of the poor in employment and seventy percent of the four million children living in poverty being brought up in working households The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty about 56 of people living in poverty in 2018 were in a household where at least one person had a job compared with 39 20 years ago Seven in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family the charitys annual UK poverty report found It was not normal for millions including fulltime workers to be reliant on food banks to feed themselves and their families Nearly 4 million adults in the UK have been forced to use food banks due to shocking levels of deprivation figures have revealed for the first time It was not normal for annual budget cuts in the provision of healthcare social care and education to reduce such essential services to the point where hospital waiting times had reached record levels NHS vacancies were running at 100000 and schools were increasingly incapable of offering pupils a proper comprehensive education Everyday headteachers are having to make difficult decisions decisions about which basic supplies they can afford and which staff will have reduced hours because there is simply not enough money Since 2015 every Prime Minister has claimed to be putting more money into schools than ever before But the hard truth is that nearly all schools in England are worse off now than 5 years ago Grotesque Inequality is Not Normal It was not normal for major corporations and their billionaire owners to arrange their tax affairs so as to avoid and evade taxation and leave the low paid cleaners in their swanky head offices in London paying more to the public purse than them The City financier who admitted he paid less tax than his cleaner has become chairman of Savills More than 9000 of the richest people in the UK collected more than 1m each in capital gains last year exploiting a loophole that could result in them paying tax at a rate as low as 10 And there is certainly nothing normal about providing incentives to countries with atrocious human rights records to purchase bombs and missile systems made in the UK with the benefit of huge government subsidies so they could be used in poor countries like Yemen to murder and maim hundreds of thousands indiscriminately including tens of thousands of children in actions widely condemned as war crimes Britain is leading arms manufacturer BAE Systems sold 15bn worth of arms and services to the Saudi military during the last five years the period covered by Riyadh is involvement in the deadly bombing campaign in the war in Yemen The last five years have seen a brutal humanitarian crisis for the people of Yemen but for BAE it is been business as usual No Going Back to the Normal Of the Rich and Powerful None of the above is normal It is on the contrary an abnormal situation and I implore the people of Scotland England and Wales to declare to themselves and their families that never again will we return to that abnormal state This COVID19 crisis has exposed the realities of life that the rich and powerful spend acres of space and billions of pounds covering up in normal times It is not the rich and powerful who matter in society It is not the wealthy bankers slick stockbrokers or billionaire hedgefund managers and media corporation owners who add value to our lives They are irrelevant to our lives They live like parasites sucking wealth and riches which they have never earned and do not deserve The nurses the doctors the hospital porters the paramedics the social care staff the delivery drivers the supermarket workers the bus train and taxi drivers the supermarket employees the pharmacy personnel the posties the teachers the firefighters the police officers the musicians and live performers and millions of other low paid and undervalued workers are the ones who are essential and enrichen our lives The grotesque inequalities of income power and opportunity which dominate society like cancer were never normal and now that they stand exposed as the ugly carbuncle they are they must be obliterated forever No going back to normal wage poverty public service cuts homelessness and endless wars Here in Scotland fellow freedom fighters must resolve with greater determination than ever that the unionist normal subjugation of Scotland must plague us no more Britain is an outdated and unsustainable imperialist creation not a country It never has been and never will be our country We will not return to normal dismissal of our right to selfdetermination Together we unite to defeat COVID19 but then we unite to break the British state and set about creating a new fairer and much better normal in an independent Scotland The views and opinions expressed

the Red Cross Delegation in Ukraine Florence Gillette Recently as a result of agreements between the President of Ukraine and the President of the ICRC the humanitarian aid was sent to Ukraine How the process of its distribution is going on and which cities have already received it Are there any distribution issues In the framework of COVID19 ICRC is supporting health structures places of detention and others with some medical equipment and pharmaceuticals on both sides of the line of contact Following a conversation between the President of Ukraine and ICRC President Ukraine has facilitated a plane to bring some of these goods and also medical items necessary to take care of other daily needs for medical care in eastern Ukraine The cargo is particularly important for the Donbas region where people and communities are struggling with the threat of the COVID19 while already suffering from the consequences of the lengthy conflict Items from the cargo are in the process of delivering The humanitarian aid delivered by plane doesnt differ much from the one the ICRC brings to Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict it is just that the specific items for the prevention and treatment of the COVID19 have been added to it Distribution of humanitarian aid is preceded by an assessment of population needs and of the requests from health structures water companies and other local actors In the current conditions we have adapted our distribution modalities we adapted the organization of distributions limiting the number of people respecting physical distancing rules and enhanced hygiene practices in line with WHO recommendations for specific populations that are more at risk doortodoor distribution without physical contact was organized How do you assess the current humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine in relation to the Covid19 pandemic Do the local populations already suffering from the conflict really need such support How do you evaluate risks of humanitarian catastrophe in the occupied territories Of course the Covid19 pandemic exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the conflictaffected areas as it created additional difficulties for people living there The transportation between cities and smaller towns or rural areas in Donbas is almost completely stopped as well as the movement across the line of contact Many elderly people are temporarily left without help from their loved ones living on the other side of the line of contact Electricity gas and water supply are all suffering from the intensification of the conflict that occurred at the same time than the pandemic Since the beginning of the year at least 20 civilians were wounded or dead on both sides of the contact line which is more than double comparing to the same period over several years Except for ICRC assistance with covid19 what kind of assistance the local population in Donbas needs COVID19 pandemic is a threat faced by all of us including in Donbas In eastern Ukraine the populations continue to suffer from the consequences of the conflict and many of their needs are primarily related to these consequences A large part of the population that remained there is composed of elderly and pensioners They must cope with isolation and carry the brunt of hostilities on their livelihood and their essential services Therefore their needs for material assistance access to basic services and protection are very high This includes needs for psychological support What measures are being taken in Donbas to prevent covid19 outbreak We have taken the necessary preventive measures to limit the exposure of the persons benefitting from our programs our interlocutors and our employees These measures include maintaining a safe distance during the distribution of assistance wearing masks and protective gloves and whenever possible substitute physical interaction by digital or phone interaction for psychological support for instance In addition we are supporting hospitals responding directly to the pandemic For example we equipped the hospital in Rubizhne with an electric generator to ensure that patients can be under ventilators even during power outages We installed several boilers and water tanks in the infectious ward of the hospital in Mariupol where Covid19 patients are being treated Meanwhile we maintain our regular support to primary health centers so that patients with chronic diseases continue to receive their treatment which is even more so essential during this pandemic Throughout the governmentcontrolled areas of Ukraine we worked closely with the Minisitry of Justice since the beginning of the pandemic to support their effort to prevent and respond to COVID19 Amongst other direct6 actions we provided basic hygiene parcels and soaps We also support activities at national level of our partners from the Ukraine Red Cross Society who have a central role in the communication and on information campaign on COVID19 According to the information you are receiving from local organizations and hospitals as well as your employees observations how difficult the current Covid19 outbreak situation in Donbas is How many people are sick and died because of covid19 The ICRC does not report information on the number of cases and deaths due to infections with Covid19 therefore we rely entirely on official statistics provided by the relevant health authorities and structures The UN SecretaryGeneral has recently called for a global ceasefire to combat Covid19 Ukraine emphasizes that it complies with the terms of the Minsk agreements In your opinion what can make Russia cease fire in Donbas Does this moment give an opportunity to stop the aggression of the Russian Federation After all surely you also have information about how much Russia the Russian population suffers from Covid19 As an independent humanitarian organization mandated to work in the situations of armed conflicts and violence the ICRC welcomes any initiative that can lead to limit and mitigate the humanitarian consequences of conflict How do you assess Ukrainian authorities decisions to combat the Covid19 pandemic Are measures taken to overcome it decisively Ukraine took the threat of COVID19 very seriously early on and worked on mobilising local national and international efforts to deal with the threat The authorities are trying to have a holistic approach of the matter looking at social and economic impacts in addition to the health matters As everyone throughout the world we are all learning how to manage an unprecedented crisis The early response in Ukraine the mobilisation of all including in the civil society and private sector are definitely elements that should contribute to mitigate the threat in the best manner possible Also looking at humanitarian matters the ICRC would like to thank the authorities for having anticipated early on the need to adapt the COVID19 prevention measures in a way that continues to support humanitarian efforts In addition the ICRC President had the opportunity to meet President Zelenskyy at the onset of the crisis albeit virtually due to the pandemic As a result Ukraine facilitated the air transport of 14 MT medical cargo for ICRC health response ICRC teams and myself are in very regular contact with representatives of the government of Ukraine the Verkhovna Rada and local authorities as well as the international community to ensure that our efforts are complementary to that of others and respond to the most acute needs What are the other areas of ICRC activities in Ukraine Do you plan to draw as much attention to them as you are spending on the fight with Covid19 outbreak A very good question that is not answered in one sentence We are a rather large organization with 600 employees only in Ukraine and with the budget of over 70 million CHF It allows us to carry out important humanitarian action Our activities are many aimed to protect the people affected by the conflict but also to provide them aid and tackle the lasting consequences of what they are going through That means that we have developed programs to address the urgent need of the affected population but also to support their resilience building We provide food parcels and hygiene kits when this is the only option but also try to support people to develop their own livelihood employment or coping mechanism like for example cash assistance livestock green houses small grants etc We also support water companies in repairing and maintaining the water supply systems on both sides of the line of contact We have a program to repair private houses and public buildings damaged by the hostilities or such as health facilities and schools We also deliver supplies medication and equipment to health care centers along the line of contact and support front line hospitals that are treating wounded people etc We also develop a network of organizations and professionals who provide psychosocial support to affected people and communities as well as advocate for those who cannot talk for themselves on both sides of the contact line In parallel we also work on protection of the people affected from direct hostilities and to be able to do that we hold seminars on international humanitarian law for Ukrainian Armed Forces and battalions as well as Security Forces and Border Guards We also have a confidential and bilateral dialogue with all sides on the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law And we work with SESU and other relevant actors on dissemination of mine danger and prevention of mine accidents and support mine victims Furthermore we advise legal authorities in passing the laws that will ensure protection of civilians We connect lost family members via our tracing activities and support families of the people who went missing in the conflict find the whereabouts of their beloved ones For that we support families of the missing and their associations but we also do the ground work we help repair equip and train the forensic institutions and authorities work with government bodies and parliament structures on introduction and implementation of laws that would lead to finding the whereabouts of the missing Finally the ICRC works closely with the penitentiary system to help them comply with international standards in regard to condition of detention and treatment of detainees This also includes material assistance such as rehabilitation of medical wards kitchens of heating systems We maintain a close contact with people affected by conflict on both sides of the line of contact via our daily presence in remote locations our humanitarian hotlines and our social media channels and the people tell us on daily bases what they need and expect from as Do you plan to do more work online to avoid direct communication with people because of the pandemic We have already taken measures that can minimize the likelihood of spreading the Covid19 Our employees always wear masks and protective gloves when distributing assistance and we have adapted our activities to avoid direct contacts with a large group of people We have replaced many facetoface meetings by contacts through phone social media and videoconference For example we replaced the group sessions on mine danger on the allocation of grants for opening small enterprises by informing people online and interact with them by phone or social media We worked with schools to integrate mine risk awareness sessions in their new remote education platforms We are conducting online trainings for the associations of families of missing persons for example We are now exploring more activities that can be done online Our humanitarian hotline operators work in an enhanced mode any anyone can call and ask questions about any of our projects What do you do to prevent casualties from landmines What are your training activities Our activities are concentrated on information and prevention on the threats posed by unexploded ordnance of war such as landmines and support to the victims Even though in many places nature took over and hid the traces of the mines these continue to injure maim and kill civilians The best way to prevent accident remains a strong awareness by all those moving in areas that are affected and a thorough identification and marking of such areas Therefore we have to be alert and continuously organize awareness session for the affected population provide SESU with the equipment put up or provide mine signs think of all society groups that are potentially in the bigger risk than the others We even go for performance art and education to reach out to one of the most potentially endangered population which are children We accompany and support those who those who survived mine accident through various programs What does the ICRC do to get access to detainees in occupied territories As we see even an agreement that was signed by Normandy Quartet leaders hasnt been implemented What could really help to push this situation Visiting those detained in context of conflict is an important part of the ICRCs mandate and we are engaged in ongoing dialogue with all relevant stakeholders to have access to all those detained in relation with the conflict in eastern Ukraine I would also like to use this opportunity and explain that the ICRC work in detention is purely humanitarian in nature Our objective is that detainees are treated humanely and that the condition of their detention are according the international humanitarian standards Our visits have modalities that entail for registration of all detainees private talk with detainee without witness s that they can freely share their concerns and the ability to deliver family news or parcel I have to say that we have been able to deliver parcels and messages for some detainees but unfortunately not to them directly We will pursue our efforts in the name of the families who approached us and for the sake of those detained What else does the ICRC do to help people living in the occupied territories How do you help with delivering letters and providing calls between relatives facilitating the treatment of the wounded From the very beginning of the conflict the ICRC opened offices in Donetsk and Luhansk Severodonetsk Slavyansk and Mariupol to assist people living on both sides of the contact line Our assistance and support such as deliveries of family news or facilitation of the treatment of the wounded are provided to the people via those offices following our internal procedures based on the principles of humanity neutrality and impartiality of our action How do you coordinate your work with other international organizations in Ukraine including assistance related to covid19 outbreak We coordinate and inform each other of the respective plans and actions during bilateral meetings We hold regular briefings to all the embassies as well as keep a permanent contact with the Ukraine Government local authorities the civil society and the structures on the NGCA Have you visited the east of Ukraine or are you planning to visit it Over the last year I travelled east on a regular basis went to many locations on both sides of the line of contact from the sea of Azov up to Stanista Luhanska to meet those who lives under the daily sound of guns I also met local and regional authorities talked with doctors and engineers working for the populations and that the ICRC supports in their endeavor I definitely plan more visits when the situation with the Covid19 pandemic will allow so Such trips are essential for me to better lead the ICRC teams in Ukraine but primarily to carry the voice and concerns of the affected population to national and international levels What goals do you set for yourself What you already have achieved What difficulties does the ICRC face in Ukraine We set goals on annual bases and we do that via detailed and lengthy process of planning for results we strive to get in the year ahead These goals are very specific but all serve to one overreaching aim to protect and help civilians and victims of the conflict We have achieved a lot in Ukraine in the past six years by implementing the activities and programs I described above We were able to reach millions of people caught by the conflict Our work is likely only a drop in an ocean of needs but we can still measure the small yet lifechanging difference we made for thousands of individuals and families and hundreds of communities Many became independent economically again others have access to the treatment they need every month children have safer schools even though they live within hundreds of meters of the line of contact Do you have any wishes for the Ukrainian authorities to overcome the COVID19 pandemic and resolve the conflict in the Donbas I wish that all of us in Ukraine and throughout the world overcome this crisis and learn from it to better prevent future crisis and ensure a better response to such

reconsider one is life Anastasia Stepanova a participant of space simulation experiments stated in the wake of the multiple restrictions over the COVID19 pandemicOver the past weeks the world has taken unprecedented measures to contain and fight the spread of the coronavirus disease Borders are being shut flights cancelled production suspended and people sent home In Russia President Vladimir Putin signed an order designating the week of March 30 a paid holiday to encourage people to stay home and therefore prevent the disease from further spreading Stepanova has been a crew member of SIRIUS19 and Mars 160 international projects simulating space missions to the Moon and Mars and through that has had experience with monthslong periods of isolation Isolation is not a reason to panic but a reason to reconsider your life attitude to the planet to family and relatives to your health and everything that surrounds us After the first isolation I saw life and the world with different eyes At the Martian station I felt unity with nature and the planet as much as ever Stepanova said After returning to Moscow it was difficult to get used to the constant informational noise that pollutes our thinking so much distracts and interferes with concentration she added The orders for selfisolation at home due to the pandemic caught many off guard but Anastasia Stepanova a participant of space simulation experiments believes that these requirements are not just feasible you can even benefit from quarantine Stepanova who is a junior research fellow at the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences a space journalist and a rescue volunteer at the SpasReserv said that space has been her dream ever since she fell in love with science fiction Of course I dreamed of getting there to space to explore the Universe even deeper she said When in 2013 Mars Society announced an open call for volunteers for the international project Mars160 initially planned as a yearlong mission in an Arctic station which simulates life on Mars Stepanova submitted her documents to bring her space dream closer to being realised I applied and after a few years of qualifying rounds I made it to the finals But by then the programme was changed to 3 months in Utah and 1 month in the Arctic In the end I got into it and joined a wonderful international crew being the only one from Russia and the only one with humanitarian education at that time she said The programme was an imitation of life on Mars and the participants could only leave the station in spacesuits to conduct microbiological and geological studies Stepanova recalled We rehearsed how to look for life on Mars based on microbiology as well as the search for extremophiles these are microorganisms that survive in extreme conditions It is these microorganisms that can live on Mars For example we found extremophiles in the minerals of gypsum which is in abundance on Mars Then we put these sleeping microorganisms in a special solution in which they woke up and showed themselves she went on to say During the SIRIUS19 experiment which simulated a Moon mission Stepanova studied the psychology and behaviour of a person in a confined space in extreme conditions in the groundbased experimental complex of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences The project was carried out jointly with NASA Isolation in Projects and Today Stepanova went on to say that after the Mars160 experiment it was not at all difficult for her to go through isolation for the next project On the contrary it was very easy primarily due to the busy schedule regime physical activity friendly team and high motivation to contribute to space exploration It all helps to live and enjoy a similar experience I consider isolation a unique and cool chance to test yourself to be surrounded by the same enthusiasts and to do what you love she said Only by being flexible and adaptable can one overcome long periods of isolation she added It is very important when in such teams all members are motivated and understand the ultimate high goal the scientist said While the isolation during the projects was voluntary Stepanova went on to say the participants did not have the comforts of home that people now get during selfquarantine We are all in comfortable apartments and houses with Internet You can treat yourself to your favourite food order online something that will make you happy chat on the phone look out the window and see the sun We did not have all that during the experiments And if you look at yourself from the outside perhaps we have become too spoiled and thats why many have a negative reaction when we are limited in something even for our good she added Tips to Have Useful Isolation Stepanova gave some pieces of advice on how to enjoy an isolation period which is necessary today to contain the spread of the coronavirus and protect the entire world First observe the regime wake up at the same time be physically active hold a plank for a minute minute and a half and then cook a delicious breakfast After breakfast you can quickly read the news and get to work creative work rmareading cleaning the apartment that is useful things she said Stepanova also stressed the importance of communicating with family and friends We are used to

preoccupied by its own problems So Ukraine should understand that there is no chance to count on the Wests financial and political support Meanwhile this could encourage the Russian and Ukrainian leaders to resume talks on normalizing ties namely on the economic front the expert emphasized COVID19 could offer a surprise chance for the UN Security Councils memberstates at this coming autumns meeting where they will have to decide like they once did in Yalta on how to live in a multipolar world in the future XXX Nezavisimaya Gazeta Turkey lacks trust in Syria deal with Russia The Erdogan regime has been flexing its muscles in Syrias Idlib which is still controlled by radical groups and militants loyal to Turkey Meanwhile some Syrian opposition media outlets claim that Ankara has been reconfiguring forces protecting the province and has been trying to integrate militants into its military units The Turkish leadership is apparently seeking to reduce the risks of clashes with Assads forces in case the ceasefire is broken Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes Syrias opposition newspaper Enab Baladi wrote that the Turkish military command planned to reset the situation in Idlib Its sources claim that Turkeys brass seeks to set up a more organized army in this area formally disbanding the current coalition of Syrias armed opposition groups The oppositions integration into Turkeys regular units is obviously a response to the escalation in February and March when dozens of Turkish troops died Russian International Affairs Council expert Anton Mardasov told Nezavisimaya Gazeta According to the expert the key radical structure in Idlib Hayat Tahrir alSham HTS which swallowed up the rest of Jabhat alNusra terror group outlawed in Russia is highly likely to be reconfigured Another question is that if the situation in Idlib stabilizes HTS will find it hard to play the Damascus threat card and impose their rules on the Turks in the deescalation zone the pundit said Obviously Turkey is trying to compensate for a major problem in its military policy in Syria the lack of a clear strategy on boosting its presence in the buffer zones that have been resistant to the Syrian regimes pressure Mardasov noted Meanwhile Damascus is interested in engaging such influential Turkish foes in the region as the United Arab Emirates and this makes the situation even more complicated For Russia its advantageous to search for a balance between Turkey and the Persian Gulf states Moscow is not ready to raise the stakes in talks with Ankara he stressed XXX Kommersant Frontline focus moves from Syria to Libya Despite a deal between the parties to the Libyan conflict on a humanitarian ceasefire due to the coronavirus pandemic the fighting in the wartorn North African country rages on This week the forces of the UNrecognized Government of National Accord seized control over the coastal area between Misrata and the border with Tunisia Against this background there have been reports that Russia is allegedly recruiting Syrian mercenaries and deploying them to Libya in order to enhance the positions of the Libyan National Army led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar Moscow has declined to comment on these statements but made it clear on numerous occasions earlier that it kept a distance in the Libyan conflict Fayez AlSarraj who leads the internationally recognized Government of National Accord GNA based in Tripoli told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he would not sit down at the negotiating table with Haftar after the disasters and the crimes he committed against all Libyans He also claimed that his opponent broke all the agreements deciding to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic in order to attack Libyas western regions According to Sarraj Russia claimed that Russian mercenaries in Libya were not representing Russias interests and were not funded by Moscow There are Syrians who are coming from Syria along DamascusBenghazi flights run by Cham Wings airline which is blacklisted by the US Treasury Department We dont have any contracts with mercenaries we signed a deal on military cooperation with Turkey in broad daylight he said answering a question whether Syrian mercenaries were fighting on the side of Tripoli and the Libyan National Amy Both the GNA controlling Tripoli and the LNA based in the east have accepted the proposal of UN chief Antonio Guterres on a humanitarian ceasefire in order to battle the coronavirus One of Syrian oppositions commanders Fateh Hasun told Kommersant that they had information that Russias Wagner Group private military company backed by Bashar Assad recruited hundreds of young Syrians near El Kuneitra and Deir ezZor According to some opposition sources nearly 3500 Syrian special ops will be sent to Libya under an agreement between Damascus Haftar and Cairo They could arrive by planes to Egypt and then sent through the EgyptianLibyan border However given the current situation in the Syrian army its difficult to believe in such a largescale agreement It is not ruled out that these reports could serve to justify the ongoing military alliance between Tripoli and Ankara the newspaper writes XXX Media Russias economy could lose nearly 240 bln over coronavirus The total losses for Russias economic sectors which are the worsthit by the coronavirus pandemic could reach 179 trillion rubles 239 bln while up to 155 mln people could lose their jobs according to macroeconomic research by the National Rating Agency Izvestia reports The crisis will deal a heavy blow to the service sector while the food industry agriculture fishery and forestry sectors will be the least affected According to analysts the government wont let this significant damage happen and will take additional measures for ironing out this economic crisis In its new forecast the National Ratings Agency relies on a basic scenario where the GDP and real wages would decline nearly 3 and the dollar rate would surge to 8590 rubles to the US currency Experts believe that this optimistic scenario where economic growth would continue and a pessimistic scenario characterized by a deep fall are highly unlikely The Russian National Wealth Funds reserves will be drained in the coming two years rather than in six years as the government said earlier specialists from the Economic Expert Group which consult with the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of Economic Development predicted according to Izvestia Given the scale of the current crisis the experts warn that the government will have to ditch the budget rule and take out loans while the Central Bank would have to start printing money to buy the Russian governments securities The hallmark of the current situation is virtually a full lack of revenues including in the sectors which are the most vulnerable to shock This creates a serious threat of an exodus of small firms from the market which have no reserves severing production ties and a sharp rise in unemployment and mounting poverty the authors of the article wrote XXX Nezavisimaya Gazeta Pentagon puts Chinese virologists under microscope US intelligence is investigating the

and Pacific region He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions is a New Zealandbased legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East Asia and Pacific region He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions North Korea has been testfiring ballistic missiles on a scale that suggests 2020 will be its busiest year of testing But is this recent show of force mere muscleflexing or does Pyongyang have something greater to gain While most countries have been working on coping with the fallout from the Covid19 crisis North Korea has been busy testfiring ballistic missiles over the past few months with March being a notably busy month Just this Tuesday North Korea fired off a barrage of missiles from the ground in an usual show of force which also saw fighter jets firing an unspecified number of airtosurface missiles along the countrys east coast Analysts are trying to put their finger on the reason behind North Koreas increased missile activity particularly during the current pandemic The main argument visible in most media seems to be that given the economic woes facing North Korea even before the coronavirus crisis the North has to demonstrate its strengthened military capabilities if it is to successfully consolidate power and increase morale in the country There are a few notable things however we can deduct from the evidence to hand Firstly the majority of launches in March landed in the Sea of Japan known in the Koreas as the East Sea Japan as we know is host to tens of thousands of US troops so it could be that Pyongyang is sending a direct message to its counterpart in Washington Secondly the North has been testing advanced rocket launchers capable of firing multiple rockets In fact in its launch of March 20 the missiles appeared to resemble those of the US Army Tactical Missile System which can fly low are difficult to detect and are just as problematic to intercept It is becoming increasingly clear that under a barrage of these missiles the US and South Korean missile defense systems would struggle significantly to shoot them all down Most remarkabe however is that the recent tests show that even during the moratorium on longrange missiles and nuclear tests Pyongyang has continued to successfully develop its missile technology to great effect The dire need for sanctions relief Pyongyang has called the pandemic a threat to its national survival Indeed the Covid19 crisis has done the dirty work of the US government to a greater extent than the US government could ever hope to do itself While the US has punished North Korea with sanctions for decades and has not relented during the pandemic China has routinely intervened to assist the reclusive state in bypassing these sanctions With the North relying on China for more than 90 percent of its trade this is no longer a viable and reliable tool to weather Washingtons sanctions regime in the face of the closure of borders At the start of April the UN special rapporteur on the right to food released a statement calling for the lifting of sanctions on a number of economies including North Koreas stating it was a matter of humanitarian and practical urgency This particular UN expert is apparently not too wellversed in the art of appealing to Donald Trumps senses and sensibilities if he has any as the idea that North Korea could suffer a humanitarian crisis is unlikely to swing him one way or another The mainstream media has for years portrayed North Korea as a derelict state run by an inept and slightly wild leadership However oversimplifying North Koreas position in the world and how it came to be the state it is today fails to do justice to the bargaining power that North Korea truly has During the Korean War armistice talks the North and South agreed that each side would be represented by three countries The North chose Poland and thenCzechoslovakia but in what eventually became a red herring was hesitant to choose a third It was only at the last minute that the North chose the Soviet Union putting the US into a state of shock and panic The North Koreans eventually agreed to choose an alternative country to appease the other side but only if the South agreed to waive restrictions on rebuilding airfields It turns out the North needed its airstrips to fly planes off whereas the South could utilize aircraft carriers instead In other words the North introduced an item out of nowhere to make concessions with in order to get the UN to agree to concede an issue which really mattered to them A rarely discussed fact of history yet seems to me to be increasingly relevant as time goes on What if the North isnt a crazy rogue state thumping international waters with missiles but is merely using the tools at its disposal to create bargaining issues over which it can concede at a later date If it is true that Donald Trump recently wrote another letter to Kim Jongun offering cooperation during the coronavirus crisis then perhaps the North isnt just flexing its muscles for the sake of it At the end of the day we all know the bargaining points Pyongyang truly cares about moving forward sanctions relief and an end to the threatening military movements on North Koreas borders We also know that the North would be willing to even put its nuclear weapons on the table as a bargaining gambit to achieve those ends If Donald Trump was as great a negotiator as he thinks he is he could have figured this out years ago Which is why I suspect the underlying goal of the US isnt to denuclearize the region but to overthrow Kims government and acquire trillions of dollars worth of minerals in the process Think your friends would be interested Share this story

global pandemic The scenario and some of its findings bear an eerie resemblance to the COVID19 pandemic and the challenges faced in fighting itUrban Outbreak In September 2019 the US Naval War College NWC in Newport Rhode Island assembled a team of 50 experts to think out ways to address a global pandemic on an international level The twoday war game scenario was called Urban Outbreak 2019 and many of its premises and conclusions are startlingly similar to the crisis and responses seen as a result of the COVID19 novel coronavirus pandemic In Urban Outbreak the team of experts faced a deadly infectious disease that attacked the victims respiratory system and spread rapidly across a metropolitan area Militarycom explained Their attempts to quarantine infected groups coordinate international aid and find a place for the vast logistical apparatus of the US military all struggled to contain the disease The experts on the panel hailed from the NWCs Humanitarian Response Program as well as the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences USUHS the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health NCDMPH and Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Lab Their conclusions drawn from the exercise were published on Wednesday Conclusions Parallel COVID19 Lessons The group arrived at 16 conclusions and provided expanded explanations for them in the report Many of them mirror those already discovered in practice by addressing the COVID19 pandemic while others could find use among experts strategizing about how to contain the virus that has already infected more than 1 million people in 171 countries killing at least 50000 of them For example in thinking out how people would react to various government initiatives the experts noted that forced mass quarantine or other top down approaches to an outbreak that securitize the response with law enforcement andor military enforcement may not be successful and could increase the spread of the disease Early actions and planning across all sectors are exponentially more important than reactive measures once the disease is widespread the experts also found Responders may be overconfident if they are not directly connected to the field Frontline health care workers and first responders are often a good source of realistic assessments they also noted The experts also warned of the danger of misinformation spreading the dangers of citizens hoarding goods and the possibility that gangs religious groups and other nongovernmental authorities could rise to social prominence in some communities amid the crisis Incorporating the present crisis into their report the experts noted that its better to focus on the death toll as the primary indicator of the scale of the outbreak since confirmed case counts will always lag and be incomplete Without real time and widespread testing of infections mortality offers tangible and reliable data they found Mortality doubling time is the most important and widely accessible metric for winning the race against COVID19 in the absence of extensive testing Resistance to Thinking Outside the Box Benjamin Davies the game is designer and the associate director of research for NWC is civilianmilitary humanitarian response program told Militarycom on Wednesday that a major problem faced by the planners was that they kept focusing on how past outbreaks such as those involving Ebola have been fought rather than on what the present situation required For example since the US military didnt provide direct aid to infected populations in the 2014 and 2016 outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa the experts were really stuck on the military not doing so in their scenario either This opposition to thinking outside of past boxes actually impaired the war game itself in ways that might have hurt the response to the present crisis The original pathogen proposed for the game had an R0 rate of transmission closer to the COVID19 virus exhibited itself with cold and flulike symptoms and required longterm intensive medical care for a small portion of the population the report notes The learning opportunity lost by failing to use the original pathogen proposed is now obvious Instead the game focused on a known and curable bacterial pathogen Outbreak on Carrier Theodore Roosevelt Some echo of these observed tendencies among leadership might be found in the present crisis involving the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt The warship has dozens of detected cases of the novel coronavirus but when the ships captain raised alarm with Navy brass about his inability to follow established quarantine standards for his crew of more than 4000 sailors he was reprimanded for it His alarmist letter was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle last week and he was sacked by the Navy on Thursday Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly told reporters Thursday that Captain Brett Crozier the Roosevelts commanding officer demonstrated extremely poor judgment amid the outbreak noting that sending the letter to as many people as he did was completely unnecessary to do It created the perception that the Navy is not on the job the government is not on the job and its just not true Modly said

and a scatter of local and national newspapers is an Irish journalist commentator and writer at RT Previously based in Amsterdam he wrote for DutchNews and a scatter of local and national newspapers Liberalism is based on a series of commandments Repeated by politicians and parroted by the press phrases like diversity is our strength become mantras long after they stop making sense But Covid19 is changing all of that Liberalism is a fluid ideology and its tenets arent written in any great treatises or founding documents There are no stone tablets bearing its commandments and citizens of liberal democracies dont carry their little red books of party orthodoxy as the subjects of communist China once did But that doesnt mean these tenets dont exist With the Covid19 coronavirus killing 10000 people worldwide the pressing question is for just how long theyll continue to Freedom of movement and residence for persons in the EU is the cornerstone of Union citizenship EU Parliament The Covid19 pandemic has done away with the open borders at all costs dogma in record time When EU health ministers met in Rome last month they agreed that closing the continents borders would be disproportionate and ineffective Two weeks later and with the virus seeping out of Italy French President Emmanuel Macron declared nationalism the true crisis and stated the virus does not have a passport The virus may not have a passport but people carrying it definitely do Now less than a month after the Rome meeting the Schengen Area has effectively ceased to exist Almost every European country has sealed its borders suspended flights andor limited entry to foreigners Europe has replaced China as the epicenter of the pandemic with the right blaming porous borders for the virus spread Open borders is a nice idea when business is booming and people arent dying But faced with an actual crisis the leaders of the liberal west revert to national selfinterest Modern civilization has based its specific foundation on the principle of liberty which states that man is not a mere instrument to be used by others but rather a main autonomous living being Altiero Spinelli European federalist Spinelli dedicated much of his life to European integration and the concept of personal liberty is one regularly invoked by Europes leaders However Covid19 has put paid to the platitudes Quarantine is now mandatory across the continent Italians violating the isolation order can be fined roughly 227 or jailed for three months Spain has arrested dozens and issued fines of up to 33000 as have France and Norway In the UK a bill passed on Thursday gives the government sweeping new powers to restrict personal freedom in the name of public health According to the bill public health officers will be given the power to order the detention of potentially infectious persons for screening Even after testing the bill allows the state to forcibly isolate the suspected carrier for a necessary and proportionate period of time Parents too must surrender their children to health workers if asked or face a fine A draconian crackdown worked to stop the virus in its tracks in China but our leaders like to pretend that they place individual liberty over the good of the state They say that the government has grown kinder and gentler since the Middle Ages In reality force their hand and they give carte blanche to their officers to act as Medieval syndics cordoning off plaguestricken streets and enforcing the lockdown under pain of imprisonment The European family may well be anything but perfect But it is the best thing that we have for bringing the countries of Europe around the same table JeanClaude Juncker former EU Commission President EU leaders settled on United in Diversity as the blocs motto in 2000 in a bid to inject some vitalism into the stodgy bureaucracy that is the Union The ongoing pandemic has proven that phrase just as empty as it sounds Brussels power to act decisively during public health emergencies is relatively impotent Earlier this month as Italys cases climbed into the thousands the government in Rome sent out a desperate plea through the unions Mechanism of Civil Protection for medical supplies and assistance However Brussels lacks the power to order its members to comply and not one member state volunteered German Chancellor Angela Merkel described her decision to take in more than a million migrants in 2015 as a humanitarian one and called on her EU neighbors to share the burden Now though the comradeship is gone With Covid19 ravaging Italy and Switzerland Merkels government banned the export of protective masks France also restricted the flow of protective equipment abroad while the bloc as a whole banned the export of medical equipment beyond its borders even to obedient clientstates like Serbia Only China having itself been hammered by the virus stepped in to fill the void shipping five million masks to Serbia and a group of 300 doctors to Italy So much for the European family European civilization is the best civilization All mankind being all equal and independent no one ought to harm another in his life health liberty or possessions John Locke English philosopher The idea of the social contract that citizens band together and behave themselves for the good of society was born in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment Since then we Europeans like to see ourselves as a more civilized bunch than our hyperindividualist American cousins or our friends abroad coerced into order by authoritarianism In reality Europe has experienced seven decades of uninterrupted peace Weve never had our civilization tested Now with a killer virus on our doorstep some of us have reverted to an anarchic state of nature overnight Disregarding the words of Locke not to mention the law reports of looting have surfaced from France Italy and the UK Scuffles have broken out in supermarkets as panicked shoppers stockpile food and water while waves of shoppers have stripped shelves bare leaving nothing for the elderly and disabled In Britain even food banks which set aside essential supplies for the poorest and most vulnerable in society have been burglarized Is this the Europe of Locke Hobbes and Rousseau Apparently not at the moment Think your friends would be interested Share this

overcome common enemy coronavirus US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan has given an exclusive interview to Interfax special correspondent Renat Abdullin in which he speaks about USRussian interaction in fight against the pandemic the stabilization of energy markets prospects of the arms control dialogue celebrations of the 75th anniversary of WW II Victory and the situation in Venezuela and Libya Question The presidents of the United States and Russia have communicated rather actively on countering Covid19 What bilateral cooperation opportunities do you see on this track in addition to sending personal protective equipment ventilators and so on Is it possible to organize cooperation among doctors on developing a vaccine or other measures to counter this pandemic Answer Well that is a great and topical question It is at the forefront of my mind every day The United States is committed to the global fight against Covid19 but as the President and Secretary Pompeo and others have said we cannot fight this virus alone no country can And I know that President Trump is grateful for first for the phone conversation with President Putin back at the end of March in which the United States agreed to purchase needed medical supplies fr om Russia which were delivered shortly thereafter in New York City I know the President and all Americans were grateful for that Both countries have provided humanitarian assistance to each other in times of crisis in the past and no doubt will do so again in the future This is a time to work together to overcome a common enemy that threatens all of us As Secretary Pompeo has made clear right now what the world needs is transparency and openness We still dont know the precise source and origin of the virus And as Secretary Pompeo has said we urge every country that has information about the virus and is working on a vaccine or therapeutics to share that information broadly in the scientific community so the world can stop this pandemic fr om continuing to spread With respect to future US aid to Russia I do not have any details to share at this time Im quite confident however that if there is a need that the United States under the leadership of President Trump would provide assistance that Russia needed to combat this pandemic The President has made that clear and we want to do all we can to save lives generally and in particular to save the lives and improve the health of Russian people Q The other area of close personal contact between Trump and Putin happened when the new oil agreement was being prepared Is it possible to say that stable working contacts at a high level on energy issues between our two countries were established and that they are viable outside of the present active stage of negotiations A You are absolutely right that those recent phone calls between our presidents our Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister my friend and colleague Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette and the Energy Minister here in Russia were all important developments in addressing the instability in the oil markets and I think a sign of the importance of our relationship and of the need for continued dialogue Just as we were discussing Covid19 the relationship between that pandemic and the uncertainty and the unsettlement in global energy markets it is important that our governments maintain the type of dialogue that they have to address those issues and I think the recent conversations not only with the Russian government but with other leaders on energy issues by President Trump was an important step in that direction Q The 75th anniversary of Victory in WWII will be celebrated soon How do US authorities treat this anniversary and the cooperation between our two countries in the antiHitler coalition during the war And one additional question how important is the joint statement which was released recently by Trump and Putin on Elbe Day in spring 1945 A Well the end of World War II in Europe and the defeat of Nazism and fascism that it represents are important events in the United States that can never be forgotten And I know how important it is to the Russian people to the Russian government that that victory also be acknowledged Which is why the joint statement fr om President Trump and President Putin clearly underlined the fact that Nazi Germany and the other Axis powers were not defeated by one country but by many nations coming together with a common goal So I think that statement was an important one signifying that the people of the United States of the Soviet Union the Russian people and of so many countries around the world suffered great losses in this war And as we mark this somber anniversary its important that we remember that joint sacrifice We also remember that the Second World War continued for another four months and of course the recovery efforts after the war lasted for many years thereafter I am in particular and I know the United States people are proud that we supported the heroic sacrifices and struggles of the people of Russia and other countries in the Soviet Uni on through our LendLease Program and through our own sacrifices on many wartime battlefields not only in Europe but also in Africa Asia the Pacific islands and at sea As we work together to defeat common enemies in particular in this 75th anniversary this month in defeating Nazi Germany it is a proud historic moment and I am honored to be a part of it as the Presidents Ambassador here in Moscow Q US National Security Advisor Robert OBrien was expected to attend the celebrations in Moscow Regretfully the parade has been cancelled because of the pandemic Is there an understanding regarding new dates for his visit or any other possible ways of contact with the Russian side A Well first it is important to notice as I did through a statement at the time the decision was announced that we fully support the Russian government is decision to reschedule the commemorations fr om May 9 It is my understanding that a specific date for such commemorations has not been set But we in the United States Government are looking forward to a time when we will be able to join together safely to celebrate properly I would expect that just as we were planning for a highlevel delegation for May 9 once international travel is possible and a rescheduled date has been set I would expect a similar level delegation would come for inperson engagement with our Russian counterparts to celebrate the end of the war Q The possibility of holding a nuclear five summit which was proposed by President Putin in Jerusalem has been widely discussed Is it possible that such a summit could be held in a videoconference format or in any other format in the coming months or perhaps before the end of the year A Well we recently delivered a message to President Putin from President Trump agreeing that a P5 meeting was a good idea Its my understanding that the substance and logistics of such a meeting are under consideration More broadly we have seen how important it is for the P5 members to work together to tackle some of the biggest challenges to international security P5 members have found common ground on important issues from promoting nonproliferation regimes to supporting the resolution of regional and internal conflicts and countering the scourge of international terrorism Russia undoubtedly has an important responsibility as a P5 state though as we have seen in Syria Russia has too often fueled instability for example by continuing to support the brutal Assad regime contributing to the horrible humanitarian and refugee situation in Syria and beyond But that doesnt remove the need for us to continue to work with Russia as both P5 members and as major nuclear powers In addition as Russia and China expand their strategic capabilities we need to work together to achieve effective modern multilateral arms control and risk reduction And this is certainly President Trump is vision and one of his highest national security priorities Q Has the dialogue on strategic stability and arms control been frozen due to the pandemic or both sides still have consultations The United States insists on engaging China in such consultations Russia proposes engaging France and the United Kingdom What is Washington is attitude toward this idea A Well on the broader issue Secretary Pompeo and Foreign Minister Lavrov spoke some weeks ago to discuss among other things arms control including New START And I believe theyve had a subsequent phone conversation since that one its probably a month ago The United States as you note has been quite clear that our priority is to think more broadly than New START to acknowledge that New START is important but to think more broadly And you have heard President Trump say that it is his desire to include both China and Russia in our next steps in pursuing arms control We stand ready to engage with both Russia and China on negotiations for an agreement that meets our criteria of advancing US allied and partner security is verifiable and enforceable and includes partners that comply responsibly with their obligations We are continuing to review the possibility of an extension of the New START treaty taking into account the threats we face today which are different than the threats we faced ten years ago Its simply a recognition of the fact that it is a changed security environment over the last decade We also acknowledge Russia is statement that it has no preconditions to the extension We do not have meetings to announce at this time but my expectation based on the conversations between Secretary Pompeo and Foreign Minister Lavrov is that there will be dialogue between the United States and Russia soon on the New START treaty and arms control We are slowed somewhat due to the Covid19 situation but my expectation is that we will engage with Russia at least virtually and we will also continue to engage Russia in the New START treaty is bilateral consultative commission and other diplomatic channels to work cooperatively to address both technical questions and issues related to the ongoing implementation of New START and related issues Q Mr Ambassador I am sorry for pressing a little but what about the Russian proposal engaging France and the United Kingdom in the future START talks A Well we have discussed this I have in particular in my prior capacity as Deputy Secretary of State and I noted in connection with President Putin is P5 proposal that there was an opportunity for all five countries to engage in arms control discussion and I think that that may be an appropriate topic to include in a P5 discussion Of course that needs to be worked out with the P5 members as we address the agenda but that is one opportunity to include France and the United Kingdom Q Is the United States ready for negotiations with Russia on hypersonic weapons Is it ready for such negotiations within the framework of separate consultations or as part of the general dialogue on arms control A Well we certainly want to discuss all issues related to arms control not simply New START New START is important but its not the only issue on the agenda Our interest in dialogue and pursuing discussions on arms control was reinforced by the recent announcement that my friend and colleague Marshall Billingslea has been appointed as the Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control I have spoked to Marshall and I know that he is eager to engage with Russian counterparts on these issues as well as reaching out to the Chinese to extend to expand our discussions multilaterally as weve just been discussing I expect in light of Secretary Pompeo and Foreign Minister Lavrov is conversations and Marshall is appointment that there will be movement and additional discussion soon on arms control Q Attention to regional conflicts which have recently been in the global media spotlight has diminished against the backdrop of the pandemic Id like to ask you about just two of them Do Washington and Moscow support the dialogue on Libya and Venezuela As for the former what steps do you think need to be taken to deescalate the Libyan conflict And about Venezuela Is the United States still seeking the ousting of Maduro Is it possible to establish dialogue between Maduro and Guaido in any form A Well let me start with Libya Basically I can summarize the United States position on Libya very simply We want to see three things the implementation of a ceasefire the withdrawal of all external forces and a return to a UNfacilitated Libyanled political process We are against external or foreign forces in Libya and that includes private military contractors and others who are supported by outside governments including Russia We do not want the conflict widened beyond what it has already become We want there to be a ceasefire and a withdrawal of all those external forces because its a situation wh ere foreign interventions are only exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the country The United States will continue to support Libyan parties in achieving a longterm cessation of hostilities and ultimately a political settlement that will enable all Libyans to enjoy a more peaceful future And so we call on everyone to uphold the commitments they made at the Berlin Conference several months ago and abide by UN Security Council resolutions that are already in place You also mention Venezuela And our position again on Venezuela I can summarize succinctly The United States supports Venezuelas interim President Juan Guaido and the democratically elected National Assemblys efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela Just last week Secretary Pompeo spoke with interim President Guaido to discuss the Framework for a Democratic Transition that the United States through Secretary Pompeo proposed at the end of March which shows how the crisis and US sanctions could be ended This framework for a democratic transition is the most recent and strongest example of the United States commitment to securing a peaceful political resolution for Venezuela And thats the most important thing a political resolution that respects the democratic rights of the Venezuela people The Maduro regimes increased repression of Venezuela is democratic actors and of doctors and of journalists telling the truth about the Covid19 response should be condemned by all countries Maduro has been blocking international food and medical assistance for the people of Venezuela He is hurting his own people Hes an obstacle to the development of his country And this must stop The United States as I mentioned has laid out a framework for a democratic transition that we have discussed with a number of interested governments including the Russian government and we believe it is the best way forward to achieve that democratic transition and peaceful solution for the crisis in Venezuela Q When will it be possible to resume practical operations of the USRussia Business Council The agreement about establishing such council was reached by two presidents And in general what promising areas of economic cooperation between our two countries in the future can you name because the economic and trade relations between US and Russia is to be honest at a low very level at present A You are quite right and its been a priority of mine since I was appointed Ambassador to focus on economic cooperation between our two countries Unfortunately the pandemic has caused disruption not only with the economies around the world but also with my plans for focusing on increasing our economic cooperation But as we work through the current situation the most important thing we can do is to work together to make sure people are safe and as we discussed at the outset that there is appropriate exchange of necessary medical equipment and supplies and so on At this point and we hope that is soon experts will determine that we can start slowly resuming some sel ect lowerrisk prepandemic business practices And I certainly hope that business engagements between our countries will resume in ways that are safe and that the approximately 1000 US companies working in Russia will be able to get back to work These companies range from large multinationals to small American entrepreneurs and they employ thousands of Russians and make an important contribution to the Russian economy I have told the American business community that promoting business ties in the nonsanctioned portion of the Russian economy is one of my key priorities as Ambassador And I have some experience with this having previously served in the US Government as the Deputy Secretary of Commerce before I was Deputy Secretary of State In the interim during the quarantine as a result of the Covid19 pandemic I have tried to maintain my outreach to the US business community I have spoken with members of the American Chamber of Commerce twice over the past month by teleconference and am scheduled to speak with them again this week And I can assure you that these American business leaders tell me they are eager to resume business operations here in Russia but understand the need for patience as we all work to flatten the curve and defeat this virus As for the highlevel Business Leaders Dialogue we were looking at different models of engagement that would be productive before the travel restrictions came into place There is one thing however that I do need to mention that is going to be difficult to convening this type of dialogue and that is the continued detention of Michael Calvey a prominent American business man who has been successfully working here for decades but he has been under house arrest for a long time as the result of a criminalization of a business dispute And that type of activity casts a pall over the entire business and investment climate in Russia So resolving Michael Calvey is case is going to be key to getting a business leaders dialogue into gear In the meantime there is a lot of work going on in the background as we prepare for reengaging I continue to reach out virtually with American and Russian business leaders In addition to my virtual meetings with the American Chamber of Commerce I recently held a virtual briefing with the Business Council of International Understanding which included over 50 senior American and Russian business leaders The embassy trade team is holding several sectorspecific engagements all virtual unfortunately including in the information technology life sciences and franchising sectors But we all look forward to a time when conditions warrant a highlevel business dialogue And when that day comes we will be ready for a substantive discussion on ways to increase trade between our two countries Q Space has recently been one of the few positive examples of interaction between Washington and Moscow But the situation is changing How will growing competition on the space services market impact cooperation between Roscosmos and American aerospace corporations Wh ere do you see potential conflicts of interests and wh ere do you see opportunities for growth A Well my colleagues at NASA I have met with the Administrator of NASA Administrator Bridenstine and several other colleagues at NASA who are working very hard on these current challenges and opportunities I would have to point to our continued positive cooperation as a signal for the future But my NASA colleagues are better placed to discuss the most recent current issues involved in our space relationship I can speak more broadly about how over time our relationship with Russia on space issues has been extremely important In fact as we speak US astronaut Chris Cassidy is aboard the International Space Station with two Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner All three of them traveled to the International Space Station on a Soyuz rocket last month And that could not have happened without the decades of cooperation that preceded it It is just one in a long long line of successful collaborative efforts between the United States and Russia in space In fact we have had a human being in space every single day for the past 20 years The International Space Station has been continuously occupied since November 2 2000 We could not have accomplished that without great cooperation between the United States and Russia And I know my colleagues at NASA are working hard with their colleagues at Roscosmos to continue that cooperation Q Mr Ambassador can I ask your permission for my last question if possible I would like to return to the start of our interview when we spoke about the energizing contacts between the leaders of our two countries I think Trump and Putin spoke in recent months more often than in a couple of years before and there are also contacts between Pompeo and Lavrov and OBrien and Patrushev Is this just a temporary thing related to the pandemic and the crisis of energy markets or do you see potential for activating bilateral and international interaction to cover other topics as well given the fact that the world is now facing a unique set of challenges A Well I might challenge the premise of your question because Ive been either Deputy Secretary of State or Ambassador to Russia for three years now and our level of communication whether it is at a presidential level or at the secretarial level has been relatively constant I recall my first boss Secretary Tillerson traveled to Moscow in the Spring of 2017 And the recent interactions that you have cited between our presidents between Secretary Pompeo and Foreign Minister Lavrov and at lower levels I speak with colleagues in the Foreign Ministry all the time I know that my successor as Deputy Secretary of State does as well It is an indication of the importance of the United States and Russia as permanent members of the UN Security Council with many mutual issues of interest a number of which we have talked about today So I would say that there has been I think the frequency has picked up in the first three or four months of this year because of Covid19 and the energy markets the unsettlement in the energy markets but I think you will see that there is a longer term trend of the United States and Russia continuing to focus on issues of mutual importance both on large strategic issues and on smaller peopletopeople issues And in that connection Id mention that Russian authorities continue to make allegations about US exchange programs and about Russian students in the United States and the US Government role in this that unfortunately misrepresent the facts and are just simply false It appears as though the United States is being portrayed as unconcerned about the welfare of young Russians in our country In fact it is the exact opposite we are profoundly concerned about their welfare and very interested in providing with them with the opportunities to come and study in the United States And for these programs that we are talking about we feel that Russian parents have the right to decide how and wh ere to educate their children We are grateful and gratified if Russian parents want their children to study in the United States we welcome them we work to ensure those students are safe What the Russian government has been talking about recently was a private sector program for high school students And on this program participants receive no funding from the United States Government Also for privacy reasons neither the US Government nor the organizations implementing these exchange programs give out the names of minors without the permission of their parents But these were all minor children who came to the United States at the direction of their parents and with their parents approval And these students and their families have been given information on how to register with the Russian Embassy if they choose to do so Private host organizations managing these programs maintain contact with all students and in particular with the Russian students at all times And we in the United States Government continue to provide support so that Russian students foreign students all foreigners in the United States who want to return to their home countries can do so safely if they choose My friend the Russian Ambassador to the United States Ambassador Antonov noted in an oped in the New York Times not that long ago and I think I am quoting him that our countries can develop stereotypefree perceptions of each other only through frequent and authentic cultural exchanges And I wholeheartedly agree And I also think exchanges should be separated from politics So we are going to continue to work to support all students Russia students and all students from other countries who have come to take advantage of the marvelous educational opportunities in the United States And with respect to Russian students whose parents have sent their sent their children to study in the United States we will work with the Russian Embassy and the Russian government for those students who want to return home to Russia to do so safely and promptly

bogeymen The outbreak has led Iran is neighbors to close their borders creating a physical manifestation of the isolation the US has sought to impose upon the nation for so long Help patronizingly offered by Washington in such a situation is likely to be seen as an insult given that the drug shortages and general poverty caused by US sanctions have clearly intensified the Iranian people is suffering Pompeo attempted to counter the mountain of evidence that the US is to blame for the Iranian medical system being less than robust by insisting there has been a continuous avenue for the movement of medical and humanitarian goods inside Iran they have not been sanctioned at any time However reality has demonstrated otherwise The International Court of Justice in The Hague ordered the US to end its sanctions on humanitarian supplies to Iran in November 2018 but Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told a press conference earlier this month that US obstructionism has continued to block such deliveries for over 18 months And Pompeo himself let slip last February that he was aware the maximum pressure regime had made things much worse for the Iranian people Indeed that was the point we are convinced that will lead the Iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regime Human Rights Watch warned in October that these sadistic policies had almost certainly contributed to documented shortages of lifesaving drugs and placed the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy Also on rtcomIran seals off religious sites as coronavirus death toll rises Pakistan reports new casesEven the Wilson Center a thinktank on whose board Pompeo now sits sounded the alarm about the pronounced role of sanctions in creating shortages of lifesaving medical supplies and drugs in Iran calling the causeandeffect relationship irrefutable back in 2013 years before Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and imposed even harsher sanctions Last month Switzerland opened the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement a private trade channel with Iran in order to circumvent the thoroughlyblocked official channels but Tehran has been forced to pay through the nose every step of the way and its patience is wearing thin The spectacle of Pompeo who famously said Iranian leadership must stop their destabilizing behavior if they want their people to eat posing as Tehran is generous benefactor merely adds insult to years of injury As of Friday Iran has 388 confirmed coronavirus patients while 34 have died meaning the mortality rate has far outpaced that of China where

political ideology above the welfare of the Venezuelan people even in the face of real attempts at reconciliation between the nation is political factions by refusing emergency loans to the Latin American country Ken Livingstone former mayor of London and honorary president of the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign told Sputnik on Tuesday Venezuela is attempt to access some 5 billion was rebuffed by IMF officials on the grounds that there remained no clarity among its members on who constituted the legitimate presidential authority within Venezuela a statement that alludes to Venezuela is ongoing political standoff between elected President Nicholas Maduro and opposition figure Juan Guido Both the US and the EU recognized Guaido as interim president following his declaration while fellow IMF members such as Turkey Russia and China have voiced their support for the ongoing Maduro administration a point of divergence that has only grown as Venezuela slid further into economic and social turmoil over both political divisions and USimposed sanctions The IMF not approving the request for resources is putting ideology above the welfare of an entire people The US is undoubtedly behind this decision Livingstone said Following last January is power struggle in Venezuela Washington intensified pressure on the country by imposing new sanctions As of Tuesday the US government is believed to be considering offering some form of sanctions relief if Venezuela agrees to form a transitional government made up of representations from both the current administration and various opposition factions Given that the sanctions themselves have had a serious impact on Venezuela is ability to deal with emergencies such as COVID19 Livingstone noted that a report by the Washingtonbased Center for Economic Policy estimated that the sanctions have inflicted more than 40000 deaths from 20172018 Food and medicine imports continue to be delayed disrupted and canceled he added Inevitably this is affecting Venezuelas capacity to deal with the Covid19 pandemic but unlike Brazil say the government has taken swift action to contain its spread Combating the virus will put an enormous ongoing strain on the country so additional resources from the request to the IMF are still desirable he said The former mayor added that a number of members of the opposition including National Assembly Speaker Luis Parra recently urged Washington to lift the sanctions due to the coronavirus pandemic Following longstanding efforts to engage in dialogue with politicians of the rightwing opposition which has yielded positive results Maduro recently invited opposition leaders to discussions in the Apostolic Nuncio the Vaticans embassy in Caracas in order to try to reach consensus over the nations response to COVID19 These are constructive moves which put to shame the IMFs willingness to see more deaths in Venezuela rather than take a humanitarian position and offend us President Donald Trump who is busy putting corporate interests and his reelection chances above the health and lives of American citizens Livingstone stated In addition the IMF is refusal to grant a loan request from Venezuela to help offset the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a ripple of protests inside and outside the Latin American country with critics of the Fund having welcomed last week is statements from EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell supporting both Caracas and Tehran is requests for financial aid Josep Borrells statement that the EU is going to support Venezuelas request for IMF financial assistance is clearly welcome I say this not just because of his emphasis on the need to step up international cooperation and solidarity but because of his specific recognition that it is US sanctions that are placing Venezuela in a difficult situation by preventing it from selling its oil Livingstone said adding that EU support signifies a potential divergence within the IMF is membership According to the exmayor Borrell is statement also effectively acknowledges that only just over a third of the IMF membership recognizes Juan Guaido the failed coup leader and selfproclaimed president while the United Nations continues to recognize Nicolas Maduro as the elected leader of the country As a result this statement poses a muchneeded challenge to the position of both the IMF and its ultimate paymaster the United States Livingstone said Caracas had originally requested access to the IMF is Rapid Financing Instrument RFI set up in 2011 to assist lowincome nations struggling to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters and viral outbreaks in midMarch after the IMF said that it was making 50 billion available to tackle COVID19 through its

leading oil producers set for April 9 via teleconference is expected to turn into a heated debate The sides will discuss cutting oil output by 10 mln barrels per day The reduction in production will be for at least three months from May until late July 2020 Its highly likely that Saudi Arabia will account for 3 mln barrels Russia for 15 mln and the other participants for 55 mln experts told Izvestia However it is not ruled out that the efforts to reach a deal could fail The looming risk is that the United States Canada and Norway wont join the agreement and Russia wont accept this The Saudis could again demand much greater cuts from Russia and this would be inappropriate for Moscow the paper writes Russia is ready to cut oil output by 16 mln barrels per day a source close to the Energy Ministry told Izvestia Director General of the National Energy Security Fund Konstantin Simonov pointed out that a major oil output cut would be very sensitive for Russia The suspension of production at oil wells would be a real disaster for Russia mainly due to climate conditions he said explaining that Russia could not work like the socalled swing producers such as the Saudis and US shale oil companies who could halt production if needed According to Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh OPEC members have not yet reached an agreement on the terms of the deal Analysts are also uncertain in their forecasts on the meetings outcome The key issue is whether a broad range of oil producing countries will agree to join the cut This concerns the US Canada Norway and others There is an opinion that without this Russia wont be willing to join the deal said stock market expert at BCS Broker Konstantin Karpov If the deal is clinched oil will get serious support and probably the Brent price could exceed 30 but it is unlikely to rebound to 4045 without relaunching the global economy the expert noted The current oil market situation is the worst in history the International Energy Agency noted in its review on April 1 Meanwhile recently Chinas oil demand has revved up and it has increased oil purchases from Russia However China alone cannot fully compensate for the market plunge in Europe and the US Nezavisimaya Gazeta Coronavirus pandemic fails to reconcile US and Iran Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has requested a 5bln loan from the International Monetary Fund IMF to fight the coronavirus Meanwhile the United States intends to block Irans bid since Washington believes that Tehran seeks to use these funds for other purposes The US is also not letting the European Union provide a fullfledged humanitarian aid package to Iran as millions of Iranians are suffering Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes that Iran has not received the IMFs aid package since 1960 and President Rouhani believes that due to this the countrys chances to obtain such help are high At the moment Iran has officially reported 67200 COVID19 cases including more than 4000 deaths However on Saturday some businesses will be allowed to partially resume work This signals that the economic situation in Iran severely hit by US sanctions is desperate according to the paper Meanwhile US authorities fear that the IMFs loan could be spent on providing assistance to Irans sanctioned economic sectors or on its military operations in the Middle East the Wall Street Journal wrote Earlier the US offered to send medical supplies to Iran but Tehran had rejected this assistance Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said that he did not trust Washington not ruling out that the US could have created the coronavirus Washingtons sanctions policy is not expected to subside under President Donald Trump Senior Researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Oriental Studies Vladimir Sazhin noted Its very regrettable that the coronavirus did not become a factor for building at least temporary bridges between Washington and Tehran The US could at least expand the list of humanitarian cargo supplied under the INSTEX system which has finally started working As for the loan US intelligence doubts that the money will be really used for fighting COVID19 and reach ordinary people but rather end up in the pockets of middlemen because corruption in Iran is very high the expert told the paper However the US decision to block the loan to Iran would deprive its citizens of a chance to get assistance Izvestia Russian NGOs seek governments assistance amid coronavirus Russias NGOs have requested a range of anticrisis measures to support them amid the COVID19 pandemic These could include deferments on loan payments and a moratorium on fines for failing to fulfill state contracts This proposal was outlined in a letter by Deputy Speaker of the Russian Federation Council upper house Andrei Turchak to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin President of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sergei Katyrin sent a similar request to First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov noting that the risks that NGOs could go bankrupt have significantly mounted The organizations have reported huge financial losses Today more than 1000 private kindergartens and over 800 private schools for at least 100000 children are in jeopardy These educational institutions employ more than 18000 teachers who could face the risk of not getting paid the association of nonstate kindergartens children clubs and schools in Russia said Our market share was nearly 23 and by the end of this year it was projected to rise to 36 But now it will plunge to 1215 Some 20 of schools and kindergartens will survive the organizations chair Marina Shilkina told the paper In his letter sent to the prime minister on April 8 Turchak noted that amid the spread of COVID19 the role of civil society in Russia is growing like never before Sociallyoriented NGOs and volunteers have been providing active support to the Russian authorities by helping citizens across the country Some 85 volunteer regional centers set up by the United Russia party employ some 85000 volunteers who deliver medication and food to elderly citizens help doctors and distribute protective gear Unfortunately the further deterioration of the crisis will inevitably impact socially oriented NGOs which will negatively affect their activities and as a result the development of civil society The current objective difficulties do not allow them to complete all mandatory procedures on time which risk their activities coming to a halt the document says The State Duma lower house Committee for the Development of Civil Society estimates that the government should provide assistance to nearly 130000 social NGOs and the particular volume of assistance is yet to be counted Nezavisimaya Gazeta Russian Central Bank dumps gold in favor of dollar The major domestic buyer of gold the Bank of Russia has encouraged a largescale export of the precious metal giving banks more advantageous terms The regulator reduced and then suspended gold purchases for state reserves Experts attribute this to a growing demand for foreign currency Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes Last year gold exports grew sevenfold by volume and eightfold in price according to Russias customs statistics In JanuaryFebruary Russia exported some 17 tonnes of gold to the tune of nearly 854 mln and the United Kingdom received nearly 90 of this volume However experts say that the quarantine restrictions could deal a blow to these exports The Union of Gold Producers of Russia is urging the Finance Ministry to allocate funds to replenish the State Fund in order to rescue the sector According to the Union in 20152019 Russia boosted gold output securing third place in the world in terms of gold production for the sixth year in a row In 2015 Russia produced 255 tonnes of gold and in 2019 its output reached 3295 tonnes As of January 1 2020 the Bank of Russia had 22713 tonnes in gold reserves Chairman of the Union of Gold Producers Sergei Kashuba told the paper However since April 1 2020 the regulator has stopped buying gold on the domestic market and this put Russias gold production sector in limbo Financial analyst at BCS Premier Sergei Deineka sees the regulators steps as very pragmatic The drivers of gold exports are the prices amid the increased demand for the metal and the need to compensate for the decreasing export revenues he noted Amid the coronavirus pandemic the global demand for gold and its prices is on the rise while Russias currency reserves started declining over the reevaluation of foreign currency including the Chinese yuan and the euro and the falling price of debt assets Kommersant Moscow eyes surveillance system to track foreign tourists The Moscow mayors office seeks to

output Global oil demand fell by about 1015 mln barrels per day and in the next few weeks it may drop to 1520 mln barrels per day about 20 of the worlds total production due to the coronavirus pandemic and the failure to extend the OPEC deal Now the OPEC members ministers intend to discuss the issue of containing oil production again A federal official told Vedomosti that the meeting is likely to be held on April 9 via teleconference Russia hopes that the United States will join the deal the newspaper wrote Saudi Arabia is also ready for a significant drop in production if Russia and the United States make cuts However antitrust laws could prohibit the United States from participating in the cartel OPEC unites not oil companies but sovereign states legally it is a supranational international organization Pavel Ikkert a partner at law firm Nafco told Vedomosti Numerous large and relatively small companies are engaged in oil production in the United States making it difficult to implement any measures to cut domestic production If the deal to reduce production by 10 mln barrels happens it will be a miracle Fitchs Dmitry Marinchenko told the newspaper But such a decline will have a greater psychological effect since the oil markets imbalance will not be completely eliminated BCS Premier Senior Analyst Sergey Suverov said The scale of Russias cut will depend on whether the United States joins the deal But approximately the volume of reduction can reach about 115 mln barrels per day he said This is a lot for the Russian oil industry and the reduction process may drag on for several weeks or even months the expert added It may be technically difficult for Russian companies to quickly cut production so that they can recover later once demand rebounds capital investments may be needed Marinchenko noted X X X Kommersant Red Cross chief calls coronavirus pandemic a stress test The coronavirus pandemic has changed the world through apparent physical and psychological strain on the general population to having farreaching uncertain economic consequences In this situation strong states and legitimate authority are needed President of the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC Peter Maurer said in an interview with Kommersant He believes that the pandemic can teach the global community to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and cooperate in the face of a universal threat Maurer believes that the coronavirus situation is really extraordinary and serious but he would not call it unprecedented If you stop paying attention to chronic diseases to other infections that have not gone anywhere you simply transfer resources from one problem to another We need to look at health systems as a whole he insisted In order to fight this particular pandemic and provide people with timely and highquality medical care strong states and legitimate authority are needed he told Kommersant On the other hand this is too serious a problem to deal with it alone To carry out all the necessary research countries need to unite share experiences and take common measures Maurer believes A multilateral research format for the development of pandemic medicines and vaccines should be created a format with the participation of states and other interested parties such as large international corporations that can conduct relevant research along with the scientific community and humanitarian organizations he noted Governments need to share their experiences disclose what works and what does not so that some kind of impartial assessment can be made Maurer believes that the current situation is a huge stress test Such crises should be used as an opportunity to understand that the world can change and people must change with it and look for new ways to move forward he added Meanwhile the Red Cross continues to face the same problems in conflict zones The situation in the Middle East Africa and Afghanistan is already difficult due to war and violence and the pandemic is only worsening the conditions Governments around the world are taking restrictive measures and that impedes the organizations activities Maurer noted The current situation also has a profound impact on the economy since it could prevent the organization from raising funds X X X Izvestia Russias GDP to suffer in 2020 due to nonworking holiday The Russian economy may lose 3 or 33 trillion rubles 43 bln by the end of 2020 and the recession will last for several quarters due to the nonworking month of April according to experts interviewed by Izvestia The expert community believes that the country will face a recession over several quarters with the service transport tourism construction and financial sectors being hit the hardest However analysts emphasized that the world economy will slow down even more and in 2021 economic growth will return to Russia Extending the nonworking holiday until the end of April significantly increases the risks of an economic recession and a decline in the populations wellbeing chief analyst at BCS Premier Anton Pokatovich told Izvestia In addition the lockdown combined with a decline in income will sharply reduce aggregate demand Thus the cost of the nonworking holiday to the economy may amount to about 356 trillion rubles 45 bln78 bln or 35 of GDP according to the results of the month The yearonyear decline will reach 2526 the expert believes At the same time the global economys losses under an adverse scenario of the spread of infection will be even greater than Russias therefore a slowdown by the end of the year is inevitable Director of the HSE Market Research Center Georgy Ostapkovich told the newspaper Russia is more autonomous and isnt very dependent on global value chains so today that is a plus the expert noted The transportation sector which accounts for 10 of the populations total spending will be hit the hardest by falling demand Gazprombank noted Spending on leisure clothes and shoes will also be reduced The summer season is a big question so the tourism and leisure sector will be hit hard predicts Anton Tabakh director of macroeconomic analysis and forecasting at Expert RA In addition even the wedding industry the beauty and fitness spheres and restaurants that fail to adapt to the new reality will suffer greatly X X X Izvestia Scientists call for creating plasma bank in Russia from coronavirus recoveries A center for collecting donor blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID19 needs to be set up in Russia though the coronavirus epidemic in the country is not as widespread as in some other parts of the world experts interviewed by Izvestia believe Such a center has recently been opened in the United States where the number of infected people is 58 times greater than in Russia The plasma transfusion technique for ill patients was approved at an accelerated pace by the FDA the Food and Drug Administration This is very necessary the method of plasma transfusion meets expectations and the risk of its use is equal to the possible benefits Pavel Volchkov director of the laboratory of genomic engineering department at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology told Izvestia However in order to properly collect the material at least five different tests are needed he added Head of the infectious diseases department at HClinic at the RUDN University Danila Konnov agrees with the need to set up such a center Since there is still no effective remedy for COVID19 any treatment that has shown its effectiveness should be investigated and possibly used on severe patients he insisted The development of the epidemiological situation will show whether this method will be needed urgently or not the scientist noted But organizing a massive plasma sampling and its preparation under the current lockdown conditions will not be easy Another difficulty is that in Russia there are fewer people with confirmed coronavirus cases and recoveries he added X X X Kommersant Mailru Group relaunches ICQ messenger Amid a sharp increase in the popularity of video calls a renowned Russian IT company Mailru Group decided to relaunch and rebrand its ICQ messenger with a focus on group communication The company has been running the messenger since 2010 and since 2017 it has also developed the TamTam messenger but both are inferior to WhatsApp Viber and Telegram in terms of audience in Russia Experts told Kommersant that the time for the relaunch is perfect but it is unlikely that the updated ICQ will become a significant source of revenue Mailru Group has developed the ICQ New messenger based on the original ICQ the company told Kommersant It has been available in application stores since April 6 and is installed by updating the existing messenger ICQ New is supplemented by artificial intelligence technologies that are used for quick answers based on context and will be able to automatically decrypt voice messages and will focus on group communication the company noted Mailru Group with a total monthly audience of over 80 mln users has an inexpensive channel for attracting an audience to its new ICQ FinSight Ventures managing partner Alexey Garyunov told Kommersant The company chose the right time to restart Telegram is facing a lawsuit in the United States due to plans to release cryptocurrency and audiences have a growing need for video and voice conferences amid the pandemic he said However it will not be easy to compete with industry leaders globally in particular in the Russian market for ICQ New a source in the communications services market told the newspaper It may have a chance if the company decides to make ICQ a messenger for a niche audience the source believes TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews

movement the ICRC would be working alongside the World Health Organization NGOs and the humanitarian community atlarge to fight the pandemic on all fronts across Africa Our work to serve people affected by armed conflict and violence in Africa cannot grind to a halt because of COVID19 More than 40 percent of ICRCs operations are in Africa Many of these programs are lifesaving and in places where few other organizations have access Violence and conflict continue Climate shocks continue We will have to respond to the needs we always have with the additional threat that COVID19 brings This virus will challenge us in new ways Wells stated In addition the spokeswoman said that the pandemic would affect each country differently based on the strength of health care systems and how quickly the virus can be contained In this regard the ICRC will work with its national society partners to ensure that the organization is responses are tailored to local realities and needs she noted ICRC

detention We are committed to leaving no one behind in the COVID19 pandemic As we race to contain the spread of COVID19 in communities we must also not forget prison populations Many detention facilities in Africa are extremely overcrowded making physical distancing impossible and creating fertile ground for COVID19 to quickly spread unless infection prevention measures are taken Wells said According to the spokeswoman the ICRC is working across the continent to implement measures aimed at preventing the spread of the disease inside detention facilities and detecting cases early With family visits also being suspended it will be incredibly important to use other means of communication such as letters or phone calls so that families can keep in touch with one another Many detainees also rely on their family for food medicine clothing and other items she added All our work will be touched in one way by COVID19 All delegations in Africa reoriented their plans to face the challenges ahead both in terms of adapting existing programs to respond to the shifting needs COVID19 creates and developing new programs to tackle COVID19 headon Wells stated The spokesperson added that the travel restrictions being put in place by countries created new challenges in how the ICRC could get people and supplies where they were needed to be The environments in which the organization work are already highly unpredictable and volatile and these restrictions just add another layer of complexity she said SUPPORT FOR CENTRAL AFRICA With the spread of the coronavirus the ICRC has started providing national health care institutions and hospitals with necessary equipment and information on how to treat COVID19 patients In the Democratic Republic of Congo we are supporting the Ministry of Health in setting up quarantine and isolation measures in two provincial hospitals in Bukavu and Goma We are also training staff in eight referral hospitals in suspected

management and putting in place infection control measures to reduce the risk of the virus from entering detention facilities the spokeswoman added In South Sudan in addition to adapting how we treat gunshot and other lifethreatening injuries we are supporting the National Prison Services of South Sudan to run information sessions on COVID19 to prevent the disease from entering places of detention We are also installing hand washing facilities in the most populated prisons and distributing hygiene items to detainees Wells stated Meanwhile in the Anglophone region of Cameroon the ICRC is employees are delivering soap and other household goods to 650 families The plan includes the distribution of 22 tonnes of soap and 44000 jerry cans in prisons and communities in different parts of the country as well as the provision of bleach and cleaning products to detention centers she added EFFORTS IN MALI SOMALIA ETHIOPIA AND KENYA With South Africa being the only African country capable of implementing a COVID19 response similar to what is being done in Europe other states need assistance from the international community Within the context the ICRC is providing the necessary equipment across the continent and helping out hospitals In Mali we are setting up infection prevention control in all the primary health clinics we support including quarantine capacity at two facilities We are also prepared to set up transit sites for suspected COVID19 patients before they are transported to treatment centres We will also be providing chlorine and chlorine sprayers and other disinfectant equipment to health care facilities Wells said Meanwhile the ICRC has provided isolation tents to the Mogadishu hospital in Somalia which can be used if there is a surge of COVID19 cases In addition the organization runs health education sessions and provides soap to communities clinics and hospitals together with the Somali Red Crescent We are also implementing a surveillance system EWARN and contact tracing at the clinics level in collaboration with Somali Red Crescent to collect information and monitor suspected cases We are as well providing hygiene items in places of

provided soap for detainees and set up hand washing stations in 20 detention facilities across the country where the employees also distribute leaflets with information on COVID19 prevention symptoms and what to do if someone gets sick Wells went on to add that the ICRC had shared guidance and recommendations with authorities and was cooperating with the Ethiopian Red Cross in sharing prevention information with communities In Kenya the ICRC together with the Kenya Red Cross are supporting the Kenya Prison Services on infection prevention control by helping them develop protocols provide hygiene training to prison staff set up screenings quarantine and isolation facilities and guide authorities on how to humanely manage the lives of inmates she added ICRC TO ADD TO MEDICAL DELIVERIES IN LIBYA In Libya the ICRC supports the Libyan Red Crescent and health authorities in promoting COVID19 preventive measures The organization has also delivered hygiene products such as soap and bleach to more than 3000 detainees and taken measures to improve hygiene and sanitation conditions for displaced Libyans living in collective shelters by repairing water infrastructure Future plans include disinfecting these shelters Our regular deliveries of medicines and medical items to healthcare centers are now complemented with extra materials such as gloves and gowns to support preparedness

American journalist and political commentator at RT Follow her on Twitter velocirapture23 Even as the Chinese government earns plaudits from the World Health Organization and epidemiology experts for its handling of the epidemic Western media havent let up on their criticism Coronavirus has given them license to unleash every stereotype and wild speculation theyve ever had about life in China and they arent about to let go of that opportunity Accordingly nothing Beijing does or doesnt do will be enough for the armchair critics of the American press Also on rtcom China closes 1st popup coronavirus hospital built in 10 days after last group of recovered patients discharged Blaming Communism CNBC has compared the governments response to coronavirus to the reaction of Soviet authorities to the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl citing US financial firm Raymond James However the company only wrote that it was receiving questions on whether or not this will be a Chernobyllike event for China in their analyst report published February 18 They didnt openly declare it had been one though they did suggest that if the virus becomes a true global pandemic the actions by the Chinese leadership will come under fire as they no doubt contributed to the spread emphasis added Coronavirus should change the way we think about China a Washington Post oped Feb 11 by Richard Haass of the Council on Foreign Relations declared He blames President Xi Jinping for replacing capable technocrats with party loyalists sniffing that Chinas leaders mostly have themselves to blame for the loss of political legitimacy he insists they are suffering in the eyes of the people Haass invokes Tiananmen Square because he wouldnt be a western political thoughtleader if he didnt warning that a repeat is imminent unless authorities get the situation under control and restore economic growth soon He then appears to threaten Beijing with a popular uprising complete with millions of citizens demanding basic competence noting that desperate people can do desperate things There is much we do not know about Coronavid19 but we do know it is no hoax China Iran are paying an enormous price for downplaying the threat for their slow initial response Hard to believe the US seems to be modeling itself on those 2 countries There is much we do not know about Coronavid19 but we do know it is no hoax China Iran are paying an enormous price for downplaying the threat for their slow initial response Hard to believe the US seems to be modeling itself on those 2 countries Richard N Haass RichardHaass February 29 2020 Such a warning from the CFR president coming so soon after the Hong Kong riots in which the US had a visible hand is not to be taken lightly especially when Haass concludes by advising the US government to plan for possible futures in which Chinas rise is interrupted Translation Start making money for Uncle Sam again or youre toast Everything is Chinas fault Wireds approach to the steadily improving numbers coming out of China was to warn against believing any statistics Beijing published because authoritarian countries always lie about their socioeconomic problems March 2 Once again invoking Chernobyl the article cited an Economist study purporting to prove that diseases like Covid19 are deadlier in nondemocracies and called for extra scrutiny for health data emanating from China because authoritarian rulers do not permit a free press or watchdog organizations The Economists decision to kick China when its down with such an obviously ideologicallymotivated study is cynical even for the Beijingbashing climate that has grown up around coronavirus never mind that attempting to compare vastly different authoritarian and democratic countries across 40 years of epidemics throws up far too many variables to yield results science might take seriously Meanwhile any US or UK outlet slamming China for persecuting perceived critics as both publications do reeks of hypocrisy given that the US and UK are both kneedeep in the internationallycondemned show trial of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange for publishing documents exposing Washingtons war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan The New York Post buried a reasonable critique of globalism in heaps of antiChina propaganda Feb 29 blaming Beijing for the economic catastrophe that arrived on US shores on the heels of the epidemic Admitting that depending on the tyrannical regime for vital consumer goods from auto parts to the face masks that have become a ubiquitous visual reminder of the coronavirus had dramatically upset the global economy it proceeded to place all of the blame on China instead of the West for outsourcing its industrial base there in the first place The Chinese government an authoritarian antique is to blame for not taking a cue from the West back in the 1990s and adopting a more open society and government the Post huffed paternalistically sounding for all the world like a 16th century Catholic missionary returning home to Spain to tell his countrymen about a tribe of faroff natives who prefer their traditional ways to the subjugation inflicted upon them by the conquistadores Its nearon impossible to find a western media outlet willing to merely communicate the praise the WHO and various epidemiologists and virologists have laid at Beijings door without editorializing to make it clear that they the reporter disapprove Even in an article acknowledging that Chinas heavyhanded response saved lives Feb 18 the New York Times couldnt help but throw shade on China for changing diagnosis criteria even though it complained the previous criteria were underreporting the disease Off the rails Perhaps running out of Mao and Tiananmen references some outlets reached right beyond Chinas borders in an effort to find problems with the governments handling of the crisis blaming Beijing for events far outside their domain The Times appeared to blame China for unscientific remedies pushed by leaders in unrelated southeast Asian countries lumping Indonesia Myanmar and Cambodia under the heading of where China holds sway Far from being under the thumb of China however Indonesia made the decision to bar all visitors from mainland China who had been there for over two weeks while hospital authorities in Myanmar cracked jokes at Beijings expense dont be so afraid of the coronavirus It wont last long because made in China Such irreverent treatment would seem to show the exact opposite of the Times implied thesis that these countries closeness to China had muted their response to the epidemic but Beijingbashing supersedes factchecking as the past two months have made abundantly clear A similar pattern seems to be unfolding regarding coverage of the coronavirus in Iran where the epidemic is particularly virulent exacerbated no doubt by years of crippling US sanctions that have blocked muchneeded medicines and medical supplies from entering the country despite being ordered to make an exception for humanitarian aid Also on rtcom Pompeo adds insult to injury by dangling coronavirus help in front of sanctionsstricken Iran Iran has been blamed for spreading the virus through the Muslim world with the Times calling it the second focal point after China for the disease and blaming the constant circulation of Muslim pilgrims and itinerant workers Except Iran isnt the only country with these two factors Saudi Arabia is home to two of the holiest sites in Islam and has a massive migrant workforce yet it somehow gets none of the blame for growing the epidemic Wired went even further claiming with no evidence to back up their prediction it seems likely that a 300000person task force supposed to visit every single home to eliminate coronavirus in Iran would become mixed with an effort to silence critics As infection rates subside in China western media can take comfort in knowing theyll probably have Iran to kick around for a few more weeks or they could stop writing sensationalist stories that shoehorn the US geopolitical aims into every current event Like this story Share it

can follow her on Twitter caitoz AntiBeijing sentiment is being deliberately whipped up by an imperialist America its supine allies and supportive media oligarchs But its just selfserving propaganda that needs to be called out China is in the news every day now Today here in Australia were pretending to be offended because a Chinese tabloid published the accusation that our nation is a giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US even though we all know thats completely true and we should be flattered that at least they said giant Before that we were getting indignant over a hefty barley tariff in response to our facilitation of Americas global antiChina spin campaign which it turns out Washington screwed us on AntiChina sentiment has been thriving in Australia aided by our Murdochdominated news media State Departmentfunded think tanks explicitly geared toward manipulating the China narrative and of course our own deepseated racism and xenophobia Because of its geographical location the US militaryintelligence asset conventionally known as Australia has been a major focal point for the UScentralized empires propaganda campaign against the most powerful unabsorbed nation in the world China is in the news constantly now and its not because of any virus Its not because of Hong Kong its not because of Uighurs its not because of intellectual property violations or any of the other scattershot unrelated hodgepodge of excuses youre being fed as to why the Chinese government must be regarded as the latest Actual Hitler all of a sudden China is in the news all the time because of imperialism To understand whats going on with China and why the news media keep punching you in the face with stories about how awful it is you really only need to grasp two basic points Point 1 We are in the middle of a slowmotion third world war between the UScentralized power alliance and the nations which have resisted being absorbed into it A loose alliance of nationless oligarchs who use governments as weapons have secured control over a large empirelike cluster of nations with economic and military might loosely centralized around the United States In order to gain more power and ensure its ongoing hegemony this oligarchic empire must keep expanding by absorbing more nations and brutalizing them if they resist China is by far the most powerful of the unabsorbed nations followed by Russia at a distant second and Iran at a distant third Nuclear weapons make another hot world war undesirable so this one takes the form of resource control economic warfare staging coups arming oppositional militias to use as proxy armies expanding military presence in key geostrategic regions under the pretense of fighting terrorism and humanitarian interventionism with oldschool fullscale ground invasions used only as a last resort and only after manufacturing sufficient international approval to ensure the continued cohesion of the empirelike power alliance But the end goal is the same as that of a conventional world war to beat the other side into submission and compliance And in this case absorption into the imperial blob After the fall of the Soviet Union the prevailing orthodoxy in US power structures became that the US must maintain unipolar hegemony at all cost to maintain a liberal world order even if it means abandoning liberal values whenever its convenient From that point on the agenda has been global domination and the slow suffocating subversion of anyone who gets in the way Point 2 Propaganda is used to move this world war along In a conventional war each side has clear military objectives that everyone understands and the weapons are naturally moved around in accordance with these objectives In this weird slowmotion world war nobody understands whats going on besides the major power players and those who are paying very close attention The various agendas against the governments of Iran Venezuela Russia Syria China etc appear different and unrelated when looked at individually and indeed you will see different political factions supporting some of these agendas but not others The only thing unifying this slowmotion movement toward the destruction and absorption of all unabsorbed nations is carefully constructed propaganda narratives The way these unifying propaganda narratives operate is simple It would never occur to rankandfile citizens that a nation on the other side of the planet thats pretty much just doing its own thing needs to be sanctioned subverted and brought to heel so the imperialist oligarchs who own the politicalmedia class make sure everyone is fed custommade narratives according to their own ideological echo chamber to prevent any domestic inertia from being thrown on these agendas Once theres sufficient agreement that SaddamGaddafiMoralesAssadMadurowhomever must go the campaign to subvert sabotage and absorb that government can safely be escalated If you can understand points one and two you can understand everything thats happening with China and everything that will continue to happen Propaganda narratives will be rolled out with increasing aggression which have the longterm goal of alienating China from its allies hurting its economic interests and preventing its rise to true superpower status and creating a multipolar world And the funny thing is none of this is necessary Westerners have been deliberately propagandized into believing that China wants to take over the world and will do so unless kept in line by the United States which has surrounded China with military bases in an act of extreme aggression that the US itself would never tolerate from any unabsorbed government But if you really grill people on how they know that China wants to take over the world youll find they dont have any substantial evidence for it Theyll tell you that China has an authoritarian government which persecutes ethnic and religious minorities wrongly claiming that this means they want to take over the world and inflict the same on everyone else Theyll tell you China has sought to expand control over some directly adjacent territories wrongly claiming that this means they want to dominate the planet militarily like the US currently does Theyll cite evidence which shows China is seeking to become a superpower and create a multipolar world something China openly admits and wrongly claim that this is proof that they are seeking to dominate the world with unipolar hegemony They wont be able to produce any actual hard evidence that China is trying to take over the world and censor your internet and take away your rights because no such evidence exists Its a completely empty belief arising from aggressive narrative manipulation One myth I think really that needs to be dispelled is that somehow China is aiming to replace America and going to run the world and its not said Chinese venture capitalist and social scientist Eric Li on the John Pilger documentary The Coming War on China First of all the Chinese are not that stupid The West with its Christian roots are about converting other people into their beliefs The Chinese are not about that Its just that again Im not degrading the Western culture Im just pointing out the inherent nature the DNA of two different cultures the Chinese two thousand years ago built the Great Wall to keep the barbarians out not to invade them Id say this is a reasonable summary After European nations tried to conquer the planet just a few generations ago in the name of spreading Christianity and civilization were projecting our sick vestigial colonialist values on a nation whose culture never drove it to such madness Violently dominating the entire planet for all eternity on the vague suspicion that another country wants to do the same to you is not sane and is not an option Unabsorbed nations should be allowed to remain unabsorbed absorbed nations should have their sovereignty restored or in Australias case granted to it for the first time since its existence as a nation and America should begin acting like a normal country The notion of precrime is the purview of dystopian horror fiction when applied to individual people and theres no reason we should find the prospect of attacking and destroying for hypothetical future offenses any less insane on an international scale There was never any reason for the coronavirus to be made into an issue of international conflict when it could just as easily be an issue of international collaboration and indeed collaborating is what we should all be doing with this virus and with everything else Lets end this weird slowmotion world war and move toward sanity Like this story Share it with a friend

Syria is in a very dangerous situation We need aid and support from the international community but so far we have received absolutely no aid or support Saker said Our region does not even have the

conditions where the virus will spread quickly He also underlined that many more people have been living in poverty conditions especially in the nine years since the civil war began which leaves people with weakened health Our health infrastructure has been severely damaged by war and instability Every hospital clinic and health facility has been underresourced for years Saker stressed We

20200405_RU_Sputnik_GNAPI66005.txt,Raw text/RUClean/20200405_RU_Sputnik_GNAPI66005.txt,RU,Sputnik,20200405,30,MOSCOW Sputnik As the world is battling the deadly COVID19 pandemic Russias alleged threat seems to be put on hold by NATO and the West and is no longer viewed as imminent experts said noting that the common fight against the virus may improve at least at the time of the pandemic ties between the sidesThe coronavirus outbreak which has so far claimed over 60000 lives and left over 1 million people infected across the globe in less than four months has shown that the biggest menace to mankind is not some country but a tiny virus Thus Russia is now becoming less a threat for NATO and the Western world in the current security environment according to Iztok Prezelj the chair of Defence Studies and a member of Defence Research Centre at the University of Ljubljana Security policy simply is about prioritization of threats and responses it is impossible to focus on eg 5 threats at the same time Prezelj said The expert distinguished two dimensions of the current situation The first deals with the imminent threat COVID19 while the second dimension is Russia which is becoming a second priority for the US and the West Russian threat is in fact put on hold but it remains there in minds of politicians strategists and planners Strategic documents and threat assessments on Russia will not change in this phase of crisis management in the West he said According to Prezelj the current crisis can be a chance for both NATO and its allies on the one side and Russia on the other to identify a common enemy which is COVID19 and finally start cooperating against the virus It is also the opportunity for melting relations between the West and Russia he added This is an ideal opportunity because COVID19 is an external nonstate and transstate threat borders among states count very little he said Prezelj compared the whole situation to the Islamist threat after the deadly 911 attacks on the United States Back then Moscow and Washington identified the common enemy terrorism and started cooperation which resulted in the establishment of the NATORussia Council in 2002 The bloc and Moscow discussed such issues as fighting terrorism cooperation on Afghanistan as well as weapons nonproliferation The cooperation was suspended by the United States in 2014 in the wake of the Ukrainian crisisIn a move of solidarity with Italy which is the worsthit European country by the COVID19 pandemic the Russian military has sent there 15 aircraft and dozens of specialists along with disinfection and diagnostic equipment As of late Saturday the southern European nation has over 120000 coronavirus cases with nearly 15000 deaths Moscow also sent muchneeded medical supplies in response to the pandemic in the US which is the new epicentre of the pandemic with over 280000 cases and over 7000 fatalities If Russia continues to help West in this period of crisis then there are chances that perceptions of Russia will change towards weakening of the threat Prezelj said According to him the longer the crisis lasts the more relations between Russia and the West could become unfrozen However this will depend on what both sides learn from this crisis and once they are back into a competition for influence and power the chance for a thaw in relations will be gone he concluded NATO Not at War With Russia Yet Everybody at War With COVID19 Dr Giray Sadik Associate Professor and Vice Chair in the Department of International Relations in the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University said that the COVID19 pandemic was becoming more of a threat for everybody across the globe COVID19 becomes like a magnet in the global security threat landscape for everybody not only for NATO for Russia or China but globally NATO is not at war with Russia to begin with but nowadays everybody is at war with corona he said adding that the world now is confronted with the global pandemic war which is gaining a priority However he stressed that Russia and COVID19 cannot be put in the same niche of threats Russia and corona are not comparable You need another state actor Corona is comparative with SARS or another virus he said According to Sadik the world today is not only busy thinking about fighting the pandemic but also about the day after He believes that many things will change after the end of the outbreak including how we fight wars However though NATOs policies are becoming a bit softer than in the past the bloc is likely to continue to do what it used to do because it was built for that the expert noted We see some ways of diplomacy reciprocating Russia sending aid to Italy when many EU countries do not send although they are members of the EU and NATO Russia is also sending aid to the US That becomes more vocal visualised That is the part of public diplomacy he noted When it to comes to battling COVID19 everybody including NATO Russia and China are on the same side but when it comes to the topics of Ukraine Syria and Libya the differences remain according to the expert When it comes to other issues like Syria Libya we see that some allies are also on a different side of the page Some of them have better working relations with Russia than with each other This is another indication that there is some room for a thaw in relations but there are also signs that NATO will continue to do what it was established for and Russia is likely to continue to do that Sadik concluded COVID19 Pandemic Reveals Militarys IllPreparedness The coronavirus outbreak showed to the whole mankind that the military aspects of security are outdated and that they only benefit the militaryindustrial complex Professor Biljana Vankovska from the Security and Peace Department at the Ss Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje said NATO and particularly the US were supposed to demonstrate their military superiority on the European soil through the wellannounced military manoeuvers Defender 2020 Ironically the biggest war manoeuvres that were expected to show muscle to Russia and the rest of the world were defeated by the COVID19 They were cancelled while the military staff is unable to protect itself from the invisible virus she said The plans for the ambitious NATOsponsored DEFENDEREurope 20 drills slated for AprilMay were grandiose with the European Union promising the largest deployment of US forces to Europe in more than 25 years Some 20000 servicemen were due to be deployed to demonstrate Washingtons commitment to NATO In total some 37000 servicemen from the participating countries were scheduled to join the manoeuvres However the plans were jeopardised by the COVID19 pandemic and the US European Command said that the drills were modified in size and scope The movement of personnel and equipment from the United States to Europe ceased as of March 13 Others deployed Europe for linked drills are due to be sent back Such a concentration of people on a limited space represents additional cluster for spreading the infection The military as an organisation is one of the best equipped social organisations but illprepared for such health crisis and disaster management Vankovska assumed NATO acknowledged the pandemic had a major impact on its troop movements across Europe Asia and the Middle East Meanwhile Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg insisted that the alliances operational readiness was not hit by the COVID19 crisis adding that the blocs ability to defend itself was unimpaired He criticised the recent drills conducted by Russia on its western borders Moscow however has repeatedly stated that the exercises were solely aimed at checking the readiness of its servicemen to deal with any contagion including COVID19 What blocs mean on a planer that is faced with serious ecological crisis climate change the devastation of natural resources common health challenges They are meaningless and it is what COVID19 teaches us all We hope that the political leaders will come out of this predicament wiser or at least more reasonable she said Russia China Demonstrating New Sort of Soft Power While admitting that the world would not change overnight Vankovska suggested that the durability of the pandemic and the severe death toll may give rise to different worldviews The socalled humanitarian diplomacy run by China Russia Cuba and even some smaller countries is demonstrating a new type of soft power while the EU the organiation that pretended to be the force for good with its alleged normativesoft power has failed miserably she said She criticized the European Union for closing the borders suspending the common market and lack of solidarity among the politicians This is indeed something that few could imagine just a couple of months ago she said The European Union has come under severe criticism for little help the bloc provided to the most COVID19affected nations Italy and Spain In particular Rome accused the bloc of being slow in coming to Italys aid over the coronavirus pandemic Responding to the criticism European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to financially support Italy in its fight against COVID19 Fighting COVID19 to Boost NATOs Capabilities Meanwhile Dr Heinz Gartner a political scientist at the International Institute for Peace and the University of Vienna stated that since NATO drills were designed to improve the blocs internal coordination they were not directly related to any external threats Therefore they the drills have a strong autistic dimension and would continue even if external enemies would disappear and NATO would not know about it Gartner who is also the chair of the Advisory Committee for Strategy and Security Policy of the Scientific Commission at the Austrian Armed Forces said According to the expert fighting COVID19 will be designed to boost the capacity of NATO in dealing with a different challenge Pandemics have played a minor role or have been ignored in doctrines and strategies of NATO and its member states as challengers altogether so far he said Meanwhile Gartner does not believe that the perception of Russia by NATO and the US will change after the pandemic weakens or over Mainstream media in the West which are a seismograph already accuse Russia of using the virus to distribute disinformation and downplay Russias aid to Italy he said He drew an example from history the Spanish flu pandemic at the start of the 20th century which did not improve great power relations However Gartner admitted that it was possible that a different positive narrative about Russias aid could prevail since the European Union failed to provide adequate help to Italy and Spain but also to Africa China and Russia stepped in and filled this void to some extent The US was very successful for example to build the very positive image about the MarshallPlanAid after World War II he said The Marshall Plan was a USled initiative which was designed to improve the economy of postwar Western Europe Since 1948 and for four years the US sent billions of dollars in aid to Europe Thaw on Other Levels Asked whether the recent developments with battling the COVID19 pandemic lead to a thaw in relations between the bloc and Russia Gartner assumed that the security relations would not change much because the the security establishments on both sides might not want it However a certain thaw between Moscow and the bloc can appear on other levels such as science research technology academics think tanks and companies which are doing common research according to the expert In these areas cooperation will be indispensable as the fight against the global pandemic demonstrates That is a lot and important and over time it could also enhance political and security relations between the West including NATO members and Russia he

patterns in the current coronavirus crisis The author compared state epidemiologist Anders Tegnells followers with the flock in Monty Python is Life of Brian This is my interpretation of that Brian says You are all confident in the authorities the followers echo We are all confident in the authorities He says you may go to bars and keep social distance and travel in buses keep children mingled in schools etc The flock Well do this But the number of Covid19 cases duplicates and then triplicates etc So Brian says You didnt understand so now go to hell The flock How shall we go to hell Master Amidst this chaotic scenario where the mortality in Sweden due to coronavirus is five times higher than in neighbouring Finland and the Swedish casefatality rate by far the highest among the Scandinavian countries conscious scientists and scholars from Swedens top research universities began to react and criticize suggesting alternative paths to combat the virus The most representative is the case of Professor Cecilia SoderbergNaucler a notable virus and immunology researcher at the Karolinska Institute and one of the signatories of a publicized letter where 22 researchers called on the Swedish government to introduce drastic changes in the management of the epidemic Unfortunately her necessary presence in Swedish public debate rapidly became the target of Life of Brian flocktype social media activists led by wellknown journalists who have tried to discredit her by all means including with the use of the medias traditional Russophobic trademark Also on rtcom Researchers blast Swedish govt for lax Covid19 strategy claim countrys death toll headed for heights of Italy It started when Professor SoderbergNaucler posted a tweet Cecilia_Naucler 13 April where she said I agree with The Swedish experiment is flawed and linked to the article published in RT A storm of tweetreplies ensued led by Now has Cecilia Naucler gone bananas in her intense effort to discredit the Swedish Public Health Authority She gives support to RT which is Putins global disinformation news channel owned by the Russian state in their disinformation about a Swedish experiment How low can one sink Kahen_1 13 April Finally and after many attacks of that type the professor gave up and deleted her tweet while she insisted on the correctness of the article and its citations But it did not help her Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet 15 April two days after the tweet was deleted continued to attack SoderbergNaucler on the same absurd grounds that she had linked to an RT article and assessed its content as correct Noteworthy the actual content of the article was never commented on by any of the protesting journalists or their social media activists Instead of linking to its content Aftonbladet continued to refer to it solely as an article from the Russian news site RT Meanwhile newspaper Expressen wrote Professor Cecilia SoderbergNaucler tweeted a link to Putins propaganda organ RT to whom another Swedish professor Marcello Ferrada de Noli happily lent the authority of his name Not only bad judgment it is deeply embarrassing directly shameful Again no link was given in the report to the publication it referred to And may I clarify that I have not lent my name Instead it was me who solicited RT the publication of my oped following a TV interview I had on RT news on April 6 I followed exactly the same procedure of my opinion articles published in the Swedish press Also on rtcom Swedens flawed coronavirus battle plan hits the poor elderly resulting in worst death count among Nordic countries Converting the above into an absurd parody Anders Lindberg the political editor of Aftonbladet Swedens largest newspaper accused SoderbergNaucler of giving an incomplete thus unacceptable explanation for the deletion of her tweet He bothered to publish this below a day after Cecilia Naucler had deleted her tweet with her positive appraisal of the RT article An important thing people seem to have missed is that the RT article was authored by Marcello Ferrada de Noli the same person interviewed on Russian TV to state that Syria has not used chemical weapons Talking about correct content is deeply misleading anderslindberg 14 April The blunt ad hominem argument by the known proNATO political editor my opinion of the independent social democratic Aftonbladet is also ludicrous in its content What I in fact then said was that no conclusive evidence existed that the reports by the NATOfunded White Helmets propagandists were true Later in 2018 this was confirmed by the thenUS Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who said about the possibility of sarin use I dont have the evidence and by the French Defense Minister Florence Parly who said We have some indications of possible chlorine use in Syria but we have no absolute confirmation Add to this the scandal over the OPCW leaks initiated in May 2019 denouncing serious wrongdoings of the organization in its biased reporting on the alleged chemical attacks Also on rtcom False and fabricated Syria slams OPCW report blaming it for 2017 chemical weapons attacks A main feature in assaults of this type is that these journalists never produce any argument or conclusions in the materials they reject per default On several occasions during recent years academics or journalists living in the West have been harshly criticized for publishing or being interviewed on Russian networks Some of them may have declined interviews because of that stigmatization I think it is time to clarify the illegitimacy of that criticism once and for all The positions taken by the Swedish mainstream media regarding any report of any Swedish citizen or organization that express their opinion in Russian media is not new But for a country which praises itself eg Carl Bildt for being a humanitarian superpower based on the active promotion of human rights in the world it is remarkable how they infringe on Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers The interference or objections on the part of mainstream media journalists in Sweden or in the UK US etc regarding our right to voice our ideas via any interviews to any outlet or channel from across and beyond our borders or to pen these ideas and publish here or there in whatever latitude we wish makes those objections and interference a contravention of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Furthermore it is not just a right for academics and professors to voice elsewhere opinions that Swedish media would not print or broadcast It is also a human right of the Swedish public to receive information from any source they choose The same is valid for the publics rights in any country Among noteworthy elements in Swedens presentation of developments in the coronavirus epidemic to the public are these two views which appear populistic as well as traceable to episodes in Swedens modern political history One is yes but the majority are elderly The other yes but its the immigrants who are overrepresented In 2004 Swedish Finance Minister Pär Nuder addressing a meeting at the SEB bank put it in these terms We have a supply ratio which may turn into a big problem This meat mountain of people born in the 40s that we who were born in the 60s are going to feed Now in 2020 a third of all verified Covid19 death cases have occurred in homes for the elderly Yet as acknowledged by state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell during a press conference on April 16 the Swedish Public Health Agency has no directives nor plans to issue directives as to how the personnel working in these elderly homes should improve their routines It is not the agencys responsibility he meant Also on rtcom Sweden to roll out mass testing in Covid19 strategy overhaul as national case numbers continue to grow Another ingredient is the current blame on the ethnicityfactor as a main contributor to the high coronavirusinfected figures The Swedish Public Health Agency provided a list with the nationalities overrepresented among the infected contravening a Swedish official tradition of reluctance in presenting statistics breakdown per ethnicity However the foreignborn in the list all nationalities counted totalled only 1258 or 11 percent of total cases in Sweden at the time of writing N 10948 State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell also elaborated on whether the quality of hospital care in the countries of origin of those immigrants could play a role Undoubtedly the ethnicity card may draw increasing support for the authorities from some parts of the public among which support of political parties with an antiimmigrant or immigrantskeptic agenda has increased notably in recent years With regards to updates in the death toll after adjusting the statistics over Covid19 deaths for the population in the respective countries Sweden still shows on April 17 a much higher death toll in comparison to Norway Denmark and Finland A main argument of Swedens state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has been that all those countries would be in a different phase of the epidemic For instance he declared Finland is far behind Sweden in its development His Finnish counterpart Mika Salminen Director of Finlands Health and Welfare Institute refuted this explanation saying that the low death rate is the result of the restrictions Finland has imposed and not because the country would be in a different phase than Sweden I have now estimated the difference between Sweden and Finland with regards to the expected and observed death toll and I have found it to be highly statistically significant Think your friends would be interested Share this story

reduce production announced on April 10 will compel Russias oil industry to scale down the production of liquid hydrocarbon by 84 in 2020 Kommersant writes This is the lowest level since 1994 when production in Russia fell by about 10 over three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union In absolute terms a decrease in oil production will be about 466 mln tonnes a larger drop in the history of modern Russia was recorded only in 1992 63 mln tonnes According to Kommersants sources in the government it was essential to stop the falling prices at all costs To do so an agreement with Riyadh was required and some concessions had to be made Other sources said that geopolitical issues had been taken into account while hammering out a deal with the United States and Saudi Arabia which required a tradeoff The vast majority of the papers interlocutors in the industry highlighted the need to cut production under the current extraordinary situation They also agreed that a controlled decline is more preferable than a chaotic shutdown of wells which would result in substantially lower prices According to Vygon Consultings Marina Mosoyan if Urals plummeted as low as 10 per barrel the decline in production of the existing well stock could reach 20 about 85 mln tonnes per year At a Urals price of 20 per barrel production may decline by 5 mainly due to hardtorecover oil At the same time production cuts at least in the foreseeable future will not result in an increase in oil prices According to most forecasts the average oil prices are unlikely to substantially surpass 30 per barrel The last time such low prices were observed had been in 20032004 2938 per barrel of Brent respectively That said companies are likely to switch to Plan B which has been in their arsenal since the 2008 crisis the paper quotes Managing Director of Advance Capital Karen Dashyan as saying To begin with all major investment in geological exploration will be put on hold Major projects involving the construction of pipelines and infrastructure for new fields are likely to be frozen Upgrading refineries and largescale logistics projects will be frozen as well with a high degree of probability he stressed Nezavisimaya Gazeta Summit of world powers proposed amid emergency Russian President Vladimir Putins idea to hold a summit of five permanent members of the UN Security Council was put forward at a time when contradictions between these powers manifested themselves and continued to deepen Senior Research Fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Far Eastern Studies Vasily Kashin wrote in his article in Nezavisimaya Gazeta Moreover the initiative was put forward against the backdrop of the start of the new global economic and humanitarian crisis he noted The economic imbalances which have been piling up for years the coronavirus pandemic and the USRussianSaudi oil price war came together triggering the collapse which according to many forecasts could exceed the scale of the 20082009 crisis Whats more the threat of new pandemics can become a permanent factor affecting national policies and consumption patterns and provoking a wave of deglobalization and a painful restructuring of a number of large economies the expert pointed out According to Kashin 2020 will be an important milestone drawing a line under the old world established in the late 1980s after the Cold War A new world will be born in epidemics economic crises and wars Cooperation between great powers is required to control the scale of these disasters he added Referring to RussiaUS relations he stressed that arms control issues would top the agenda during the summit adding that the survival of the arms control systems was in question The Americans overestimate Russias interest in the agreement Russia has been preparing for the potential collapse of the arms control system for a long time investing in improving its nuclear triad and its control systems he stressed The expert also highlighted the need for countries to have realistic expectations from the upcoming summit Given the precrisis start of 2020 much more can happen in the world by the time of the summit which is expected to be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in September Kashin concluded Izvestia Iran offers US assistance in combating coronavirus Tehran has offered Washington assistance in the fight against COVID19 since protection from the infection is the task of the entire global community which is above political disagreements Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali told Izvestia In fact the fight against the spread of the coronavirus and curbing the disease is for the protection of the entire human community Given the fact that the virus knows no boundaries all countries need to pool efforts to counter it The Islamic Republic even in relation to the United States which is apparently hostile to us and imposed cruel illegal and inhuman sanctions against us expressed its willingness to provide its people with assistance in the fight against coronavirus the ambassador stressed He also noted that Iran was ready to start supplying test systems to other countries specifically Palestine Yemen and Syria In Iran we have used all the capabilities of our research centers in particular sciencebased companies to produce the means to counter the coronavirus and have achieved some success he explained When asked to comment on Tehrans stance on the USIsraeli Middle East plan known as the deal of the century the envoy described it as a stillborn plan It has no chances of being a success since it takes into account the interests of one side only and does not take into account the interests of the Palestinian people The Americans put forward their proIsraeli plan without assessing the real situation and this is a big mistake he stressed Referring to the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant the ambassador noted that the implementation of the project continued in accordance with the agreement The moratorium on US sanctions regarding Irans peaceful activities has been extended However if the sanctions are imposed the continuation of the construction will fully depend on Russias State Nuclear Energy Corporation Rosatom he said Nezavisimaya Gazeta COVID19 deals blow to Chinas global ambitions The coronavirus pandemic threatens to trigger a series of economic crises in those countries which have received assistance from China as part of the One Belt One Road initiative Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes citing data provided by the US International Institute for Strategic Studies Trotted out by Chinese President Xi Jinping it has become a key element of an ambitious plan to turn China into a global leader Meanwhile the countries involved in the project are the most vulnerable to the coronavirusrelated economic challenges Many of them have a high level of external debt In order to maintain a balance in their finances and keep their currencies stable they need to ensure a constant influx of export earnings foreign direct investment and foreign loans Now they also have to increase borrowing to support their healthcare systems China will have to respond to the debt crises According to the reports authors borrowers could seek debt restructuring on a multilateral basis putting China in the same position as Western creditors which means the conditions on which the money was given should be transparent This option is not acceptable for Beijing However if the issue at hand is bilateral agreements Chinas approach is likely to be more flexible If some debts are forgiven Beijing will act as a benevolent partner of poor countries strengthening its influence in the third world However given the current circumstances that approach could deal a blow to the Chinese Communist Partys prestige domestically Andrei Karneev who heads the School of Asian Studies at the Higher School of Economics stressed to the paper that a huge amount of money and political resources had been poured into the initiative This being so it would be logical to refrain from drastic steps The most important thing to do is to rescue the project itself On the other hand it is not necessary to request payment After all there were examples when some sort of transport infrastructure ports and mineral deposits were offered to China he said Izvestia Moscow imposes tougher restrictions amid worsening coronavirus situation Starting Wednesday people will only be able to travel around Moscow and the Moscow Region only after acquiring a digital pass Izvestia writes The reason for the tougher measures is a substantial increase in the number of people who have contracted the novel coronavirus According to experts that was to a certain extent the result of some peoples carelessness who continued to actively visit public places Therefore the newlyimposed restrictive measures are vital In general the authorities actions are aimed at preventing morbidity prominent Russian attorney Anatoly Kucherena told the paper The task of the police now is to explain to people how formidable the danger is If a person believes that he or she was fined unreasonably the decisions on the fine can be appealed The most important thing is to refrain from actions aimed at resisting the police It is essential to explain to police officers that there were good reasons for going outside he explained Meanwhile health professions are certain that tough restrictive measures in Moscow and the Moscow Region are absolutely necessary The growth of the number of coronavirus cases cannot be avoided in the near future said experts interviewed by Izvestia The situation could deteriorate within the next two weeks because of the irresponsible behavior by some people stressed Chief Physician of the Lider Meditsiny medical center Yevgeny Timakov The two next weeks will show the true effectiveness of the quarantine measures It will be clear whether it is worth toughening them further The increase in the number of cases which we see now is far from the limit yet Ivan Konovalov associate professor of the Department of Infectious Diseases warned TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews

disaster healthcare team despite the embargo burdenCuban disaster medicine professionals have been dispatched to at least 14 countries so far including Italy Spain and Andorra where they are struggling to curb the coronavirus outbreak However the heroic efforts of Cuban doctors have received little if any recognition from the Western mainstream media which is addressing the issue only to warn that the communist islands practice of exporting medical workers has a dark side and that allowing Havana to exploit the virus for hard currency will just empower repression at home Decades of Successful Humanitarian Work In late March Cuba sent 52 doctors and nurses to Italy the European country most severely hit by the coronavirus disease The country is medical volunteers who were among first responders to the COVID19 outbreak in Wuhan a few months ago also rushed to Venezuela Belize Nicaragua Haiti Jamaica and many other countries It is not the first time that the island nation has come to the rescue of those in need in 2014 it offered over 460 doctors and nurses to West Africa to cope with the Ebola outbreak it helped Haiti combat cholera and dealt with the consequences of the

Reeve an American who fought for Cuba is independence from Spain in the 1870s Even before the pandemic erupted more than 28000 Cuban medical professionals were working in 59 countries throughout the world mostly assisting developing and poor nations What is Behind the Brigade is Efficiency Resilience Dr Limonta outlines a number of reasons for the recognised efficiency of the Henry Reeves contingent first singling out the high quality of medical training in Cuba compared to the best medical universities in the world He added that the Cubans have an indepth knowledge of patient care which includes vigilance for society and vigilance for the citizen as a social entity in addition to their understanding of biology and psychology The scientist highlights that Cuba is socialist concept played a crucial role in developing a system which guarantees the government support for prevention and cure of diseases as well as rehabilitation in necessary cases within the framework of universal health coverage According to Dr Limonta much of the credit goes to Fidel Castro who was the greatest enthusiast counsellor and participant of the effort guided by the principle of maximum attention to the health of the people He recollects that Castro was behind the creation of medical universities and important scientific institutions throughout the country in order to provide Cubans with the best medical aid in terms of both quality and quantity One should bear in mind that the Cuban healthcare has been evolving under the heavy pressure of US sanctions The North American blockade has undoubtedly affected the entire Cuban health system but the potential accumulated by Cuba is healthcare is of such magnitude that despite the affectations of the blockade the system remains capable of solving Cuba is problems and even helping other countries as is the case today when Cuba has sent medical aid to combat COVID19 to different countries of the world including Italy adds Limonta former founder and first director of the Centres for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology of Cuba ELAM Cuban Medical Internationalism On 15 November 1999 the Cuban government founded the

countries have graduated from the medical institution since its first class in 2005 In general the island country has 485475 workers in its national health system with 89 doctors for every 1000 people For comparison is sake the US has just 259 physicians per 1000 people according to the World Health Organisation WHO In 2007 Canadian Cuba experts Robert Huish and John M Kirk released their book Cuban Medical Internationalism and the Development of the Latin American School of Medicine which offered an insight into the Caribbean nation is experience and best practices in containing pandemics

have made a serious impact on the nation is likely ability to combat the spread of COVID19 with the potential influx of the virus projected to further exacerbate the country is humanitarian crisis experts told Sputnik According to a report by the Campaign Against Arms Trade CAAT group the UK government approved the sale of 53 billion pounds 66 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia during the first four years of the Saudiled coalitions operations in Yemen against the Houthi rebels that began in 2015 with a further 1 billion pounds in arms being delivered to the other members of the coalition These arms have played a vital role in attacks on Yemens health care system which campaigners state may also make the country more vulnerable to the global COVID19 pandemic The World Health Organization has already warned of the potential devastation that the coronavirus disease could have in Yemen despite there reportedly being no confirmed cases of the disease in the country so far ATTACKS ON YEMENS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM According to CAATs spokesman Andrew Smith health care facilities in Yemen have the target of strikes by the Saudiled coalition We know that health care facilities have been bombed we know that tens of thousands of people have been killed and we know that the humanitarian crisis has already dragged health care facilities to breaking point Smith told Sputnik UK warplanes are among the list of items purchased by Saudi Arabia for use in the ongoing clashes with Houthi rebels in Yemen The CAAT spokesman also stated that the UK was supplying bombs and missiles for use in the conflict There is no doubt that UKmade fighter jets have played a part in that and there is no doubt that UKmade bombs and missiles have played a part in that These are not just numbers they have consequences and those consequences are brutal and deadly Smith said The CAAT spokesman also claimed that a High Court ruling handed down this past year which prohibits the UK government from issuing additional arms export licenses for potential use in Yemen had not prevented the Saudiled coalition from building up stockpiles of UKmade weapons something that could involve the continued use of such armaments Now at some point those licenses will come to an end but there is going to be stockpiles of weapons which are with Saudi forces and a lot of them have been transferred under socalled open licenses so we do not know the full amount of how many bombs and missiles have gone over So these could be used to deadly effect for potentially years to come Smith said CAAT had fought and won their case in the Court of Appeal last year following an initial defeat in the High Court in 2017 that had then deemed UK arms sales for possible use in Yemen to be within the law Appeal judges however ruled last June that it was irrational and therefore unlawful for the UK government to have granted arms export licenses for use in Yemen without properly scrutinizing their potential impact on civilians a ruling that has effectively halted the issuing of additional licenses However that decision has no effect on weapons already stockpiled nor current open arms export licenses a fact that has sparked concern over the continued use of UK arms sold to Saudi Arabia in a conflict that has already cost over 100000 lives The 2019 court victory banned exports going forward but what it did not do is stop the arms already being transferred under existing licenses Smith remarked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced repeated pressure in the House of Commons particularly from outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to come to terms with the impact of the countrys arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the devastation these weapons are causing in Yemen The controversy surrounding the use of UK arms to bomb Yemeni health care facilities could increase if COVID19 begins to spread in the country According to a March press release by the human rights group ReliefWeb more than 23 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in Yemen since 2017 and the countrys health crisis will only deteriorate further if faced with another epidemiological challenge YEMENS COVID19 VULNERABILITY Smith referred to the WHOs warnings of the potentially devastating impact that COVID19 could have in Yemen highlighting the attacks on health care facilities in the country The warnings from the World Health Organization are that Yemen is vulnerability to a pandemic could be very severe They have warned of a potential explosion of cases and a reason for that is not just that the health infrastructure has been destroyed but also the lack of access to clean water and the widespread destruction of other essential sanitation facilities Smith said The alarm at the severity of the situation on the ground was shared by Osamah Alfakih director of media communications and advocacy for the nongovernmental organization Mwatana for Human Rights who warned that the nations health system was struggling even before the outbreak of armed conflict It is a nightmare to imagine COVID19 spreading in Yemen Even before the current war the health care system was not responding to the needs of the population in Yemen and Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the world and the lowest human development indicators in the Middle East and North Africa he said This fact alone means that Yemen is likely illequipped to deal with the spread of COVID19 as the ongoing conflict has placed a considerable strain on a health care system that was already failing to meet the populations needs Alfakih said The hospitals would not be able to cope with the spread of COVID19 and one of the contributing factors is the behavior of the warring sides Alfakih stated Speaking on the role of foreign arms in the current conflict Alfakih also claimed it was unfortunate that the Yemeni people had been introduced to such nations through the fact their bombs were dropping on their heads The NGO advocacy and communications chief added that major arms exporting powers such as the UK and France were partly responsible for the manmade crisis now taking place The war does not only have an impact on the health system but it also has a huge impact on the Yemenis and the whole country The warring sides undermine the lives of civilians and the state institutions the expense of rule of law empowering and emboldening different armed groups to seize control of different parts of Yemen Alfakih stated The emergence of COVID19 in many parts of the world has only added to the sense of apprehension endured by the general population Although Yemen is not believed to have yet reported a single confirmed cases of the disease the incapacity of much of the country is health infrastructure remains a source of anxiety for those likely to depend on it should the virus continue to spread There are fear and panic among the people in general For instance big supermarkets are crowded with people who want to get food for the coming period in case the situation gets more deteriorated Alfakih stated The NGO advocacy and communications director added that the difficulties of daily life in Yemen as a result of the conflict would also make it incredibly difficult for people to selfisolate given the difficulties of earning a living in the country It is very much difficult to imagine people staying at home if there are more measures taken because of the coronavirus particularly those who get their income on a daily basis In addition to all of this people need to bear the war and its burden Alfakih stated A separate report from Mwatana claimed that health workers and facilities have been targeted at least 120 times by the warring parties between 2015 and 2018 resulting in 96 civilian deaths and the wounding of several hundred Health care facilities are believed to have at times been damaged during airstrikes by the Saudiled coalition with a missile fired from a coalition aircraft destroying a petrol station in March 2019 that resulted in several fatalities in an adjacent hospital The opposition Houthi movement is also believed to have fired upon civilian

Humanitarian War on Yugoslavia Follow him on Twitter GeorgeSzamuely is a senior research fellow at Global Policy Institute London and author of Bombs for Peace NATO is Humanitarian War on Yugoslavia Follow him on Twitter GeorgeSzamuely NATO struggling to justify its existence has found a new role for itself as an indefatigable fighter against the Covid19 pandemic But so far it has contributed significantly less to this fight than its supposed rivals During a NATO foreign ministers meeting held earlier this month by secure video conference Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg declared NATO was created to deal with crises So we can help and our Alliance is playing its part NATO was on the case But what exactly was it doing Here Stoltenberg became vague NATO would apparently offer logistical transport and medical help to memberstates fighting the pandemic Russia and China have of course been providing logistical transport and medical help all over the world for weeks but NATO makes it sound as if it alone is doing anything and rushes to take credit for aid that in reality has nothing to do with the alliance On March 30 a cargo aircraft from China landed in the Czech Republic to deliver respirators and face masks This was the third such transport flight from China to the Czech Republicunder the NATO supported Strategic Airlift International Solution NATO proudly announced So China delivers medical equipment and NATO takes the credit Recently NATO memberstate Turkey was supposed to deliver medical supplies to NATO memberstates Spain and Italy Once again NATO rushed to take credit Stoltenberg was proud to see NATO Allies supporting each other through our disaster relief centre Understandably Stoltenberg didnt address Spains complaint that Turkey had seized hundreds of ventilators and sanitary equipment that Spain had already paid for The ventilators had reportedly been manufactured in Turkey on behalf of a Spanish firm that bought the components from China Subsequently Turkey ordered all domestic mask producers to produce exclusively for the Turkish state Lack of cooperation among NATO memberstates has become endemic In the US the Trump administration ordered healthcare equipment firm 3M to stop exporting N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America In response Justin Trudeau Canadas prime minister threatened retaliation We have an enormous number of products that are essential for the United States in their fight against Covid19 Canada he said provides the US doctors nurses testing kits and key ingredients for the N95 masks Meanwhile Germany accused the US of engaging in modern piracy by diverting in Bangkok Thailand 200000 facemasks that were destined for Germany France also complained when the US seized a consignment of masks bound for France from China The masks were on a plane at Shanghai airportwhen the US buyers turned up and offered three times what their French counterparts were paying the Guardian reported Germany in turn had initially banned the export of medical masks and other protective gear to Italy Though Germany did eventually relent there was no relenting on Spain Italy and Frances plea that coronavirusincurred debt be shared out in the form of coronabonds Germanys refusal infuriated the Italians so much that a group of Italian mayors and politicians bought a page in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to remind Germany that it had not been forced to pay back its debts after World War II In stark contrast to the reluctance of NATO memberstates to do much for one another China and Russia have been delivering aid all over the world including NATO countries Russia sent masks and ventilators to the United States and ventilators medical equipment and military virologists and epidemiologists to Italy Russia also sent coronavirus testing kits to Iran North Korea and Venezuela as well as to former USSR republics such as Armenia Azerbaijan and Belarus Russia has also sent military doctors and virology and epidemiology specialists to Serbia China also stepped up to the plate It sent coronavirus testing kits as well as ventilators masks and doctors to Italy testing kits to Spain and facemasks to Holland It also delivered coronavirus testing kits to Palestine and aid to Cambodia and Malaysia NATO as useless now as in 2008 2015 crises Contrary to Stoltenbergs claims then the most striking feature of the coronavirus crisis is the absence of a NATO contribution to its solution Pandemics are as old as humanity Sooner or later something like Covid19 was bound to come along Yet despite all of the resources NATO had eaten up over the years it has undertaken no emergency planning for a possible pandemic or a biological weapon attack Its military hardware vaunted command structures and constant military exercises are as useless today as they were in 2015 when Europe faced its last serious crisis Of course it was NATO itself that triggered the 2015 migration crisis Its reckless intervention to overthrow the government of Libyas Muammar alQaddafi threw the previously stable North African country into chaos and caused the massive flow of migrants into Europe The same sequence followed the subsequent intervention of key NATO powers in the civil war in Syria In 2015 Europeans woke up to discover not only that their most urgent security problem was not Russia Ukraine and Crimea NATOs obsessive concern but Europes open borders a problem NATO had done nothing to address and worse had exacerbated by fueling instability on Europes periphery Yet NATO offered no explanation as to why Europes borders had remained so porous for decades Similarly in the face of a spate of terrorist attacks in Europe in 2015 NATO was unable to explain why after supposedly fighting terrorism for the better part of two decades it had done so little to safeguard Europe from the scourge of terrorism In a speech delivered in Wellington New Zealand on Aug 5 2019 a few months before the Covid19 outbreak Stoltenberg declared that the greatest challenge the West faced was increased competition between great powers and that a more assertive Russia is putting the rules based order under pressure Russia was everywhere threatening everyone trying to meddle in and undermining the trust in democratic institutions And then there was the rise of China China and Russia Stoltenberg warned represent challenges for all of us both NATO Allies andmany other countries So there it is A few months before the onset of a global pandemic the full ramifications of which we can today barely grasp NATO was expressing alarm about Russia and China the two powers that have done far more to help NATO countries out during this pandemic than NATO itself has Meanwhile Europe and the United States careen toward an economic catastrophe that will dwarf the 2008 crisis by several orders of magnitude NATOs contribution to solving that crisis will be as useless as its contribution to solving the 2008 crisis What will it be It will plead with memberstates not to skimp on their contributions to a security organization from which they derive no security Think your

Covid19 China and the US are using the coronavirus pandemic as a tool in their struggle for global leadership Beijing claims that its state system made it possible to curb the infection and all allegations that the epidemics scope was concealed are nothing but fiction However Washington keeps pushing its accusations Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes China has sent medical teams to 16 countries Over 125 nations and four international organizations have received coronavirus testing systems protective gear and equipment from Beijing China donated 50 mln to the World Health Organization WHO in March and April Daniel Lynch a professor at the City University of Hong Kong believes that Beijing is not guided only by humanitarian considerations First if Beijing fails to help other countries combat the pandemic it may once again hit China Second China seeks to protect its longterm interests in those countries involved in its One Belt One Road project However Washington is doing everything to make the world and the American people believe that Beijing is to blame for all their troubles US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and intelligence chiefs are tirelessly focusing on this In addition Republican senators have embarked on using propaganda attacks against China in the coming presidential race The National Republican Senatorial Committee has issued a memorandum emphasizing three things it was China that triggered the pandemic by concealing the coronavirus outbreak the Democratic Party is too soft on China and there is a need to impose sanctions on China Chief Research Associate at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute for the US and Canadian Studies Vladimir Batyuk told the newspaper that only four months ago everyone was sure that Trump would be triumphantly reelected The economy was on the rise and unemployment was declining But now on the one hand the coronavirus pandemic came like a bolt from the blue and on the other an economic crisis has followed with an oil price plunge dealing a blow to the US economy All this may have enormous negative consequences for the incumbent US president This is why the memo is aimed at distracting voters from these problems The only thing left to do is to blame everything on China the expert emphasized XXX Kommersant US informs Russia of grievances over Open Skies Treaty Kommersant has found out that the United States presented its written grievances over the Treaty on Open Skies to Russia A document on the matter was handed over to the Russian delegation during talks that took place in Vienna back in January Moscow deemed that the document was made in a peremptory manner Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the paper that it is the US that is violating the treaty and wants to pull out of it not Russia Russian top diplomat Sergey Lavrov said last week that judging by the signals from Washington US officials were about to announce their withdrawal from the Treaty on Open Skies a multilateral agreement that permits parties to conduct reconnaissance flights over each others territory in order to boost mutual trust The Pentagon and US Department of State are evasive about the United States potential withdrawal from the treaty but Lavrov confirmed for the first time that Moscow was inclined to believe those experts who said that Washington had already made up its mind Kommersant has also discovered that the Treaty on Open Skies was brought up at the January consultations on strategic stability which involved Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Ford The Russian diplomat confirmed to the paper that Moscow had received the relevant document Russia provided detailed responses to all of the US grievances and clarified its position including a number of aspects that point to the United States noncompliance Ryabkov added The Russian Foreign Ministry has recently released a detailed comment on its website which makes it clear that Moscow accuses Washington of five cases of the treatys violation Ryabkov believes that problems with the treaty come from Washingtons stance The problem is that the Americans are unwilling to make agreements he told the newspaper Like with other contentious issues they just seek to impose their position that cannot be subject to adjustment and demand that we simply accept it However it is impossible because we have an opposite view of the situation the senior Russian diplomat pointed out XXX Nezavisimaya Gazeta Kim dead or alive the question still looms

all those discussions were speculative North Korea is a closed country and the information that comes from there provides scope for speculations In any case there hardly is an organization at least

rtcomWhy dont celebrities put their money where their mouths are and livestream a new Live AidIn a recent interview with Anderson Cooper Penn who has described Trump as an enemy of mankind appeared to be propped up as some kind of military expert based on his charity work in places like Haiti He mumbled his way through the segment and encouraged the US military which he describes as a humanitarian

pandemic serious though that is with global deaths doubling over the past week What is also sick is the way gestures of solidarity are being cynically twistedTake the arrival of Russian medical aid to the US this week That was promptly arranged after US President Donald Trump asked his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a phone call for help in coping with the coronavirus crisis Even before the Antonov124 cargo plane touched down at JFK airport certain US media outlets were labelling the gesture of solidarity as a propaganda gimmick by the Kremlin It was surmised that the Russian response to the US request for aid was to push efforts for relief from sanctions imposed by Washington The cynical inference is that supposed Russian conniving and deceit knows no bounds in the black art of manipulation How about just simply acknowledging the evident fact that Russia is sending vital medical help to the US at a time of need motivating by no other sentiment than basic humanitarian compassion The fact that Russia has been slapped with numerous US sanctions over recent years since the Ukraine crisis as well as stemming from bizarre claims of Moscow meddling in the 2016 US presidential election only goes to show Russias capacity for magnanimity Simple as that folks The same pathetic distortion was earlier voiced regarding Russian and Chinese aid to Italy and other European countries stricken with the deadly virus This week a European Union socalled media watchdog warned that Russia and China were engaged in a disinformation campaign to undermine public trust in national healthcare systems There are also reports of claims by US intelligence and other officials that China is to blame for spreading the disease because it deliberately underreported the outbreak that initially occurred in December thereby allegedly leaving Western nations illprepared to withstand the pandemic Those claims are patently false China had alerted the world to the seriousness of the disease as early as January when it was itself getting to grips with the uncertain public health crisis Western nations had three months to learn from Chinas experience as well as from neighboring South Korea where authorities clamped down on the epidemic But Western governments for various reasons no doubt primarily due to budgetary costs chose instead to ignore the threat Trump and Britains Prime Minister Boris Johnson in particular showed stupendous nonchalance bordering on callous indifference Both of them dismissed the looming Covid19 crisis as a passing flu Only last week Trump was touting the US getting back to business by Easter What is abundantly evident is that the US Britain and other Western states are not prepared to deal with the present crisis because of their rundown public health services That structural problem is a matter of government neglect over many years to ensure that their citizens are adequately protected in a time of crisis And that neglect stems from deliberate policy choices such as showering the rich with tax breaks and squandering trillions on militarism while relentlessly cutting funds for public services In short the coronavirus crisis is a reflection of a deeper crisis in the capitalist system that prevails among Western states as American professor Richard Wolff explains Societal human needs are always sacrificed on the altar of elite private profit The fact that in the US and Britain there is a paltry number of test kits for checking the disease and a dearth of vital protective equipment for medical staff is a national disgrace due to inherent political and economic reasons That is what needs to be focused on That is where the public anger should be directed Why have citizens been so abjectly betrayed by their governments whose first duty of care should be to protect them It is absurd and contemptible for certain media and pundits to try to distract from the central issue of bankrupt democracy by seeking to disparage Russia over humanitarian aid or scapegoat China for the systemic failures of Western governments One senses however that the ploys of Russophobia and Chinaphobia have become hopelessly threadbare in credibility In Britain for example normally Conservativesupporting media are asking angry questions on their front pages about government dereliction Are we to believe that such anger is the result of Russia and China sowing disinformation to undermine public trust No it is simply a case of citizens realizing slowly and painfully that their governments and society organized on capitalist priorities is a shambles unworthy of the name democracy The sickness of smearing and blaming others instead of dealing honestly with inherent problems will only embolden the public even more to exact retribution from their culpable authorities As millions of workers and their families reap poverty and illness one senses too that the pitchforks are being taken down from the barn roofs Sickness in the West is going viral but maybe some lasting benefit may come from this crisis in the end if societies are overhauled for the greater good of citizens The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik

Hungersnot zeichnet sich erneut ab Der Konflikt eskaliert erneut Die Wirtschaft liegt wieder in Trümmern Die humanitären Hilfsorganisationen sind wieder nahezu bankrott sagte Lowcock in einem Briefing vor dem UNSicherheitsrat Außerdem gebe es derzeit 43 aktive Konfliktlinien im Januar seien noch 33 gezählt worden Und dann die neuen Probleme COVID19 gerät außer Kontrolle und wir haben die traurige Geschichte des SaferTankers Nach Angaben des UNOUmweltprogramms könnte das Auslaufen des Öls aus dem Tanker das Ökosystem des Roten Meeres zerstören von dem fast 30 Millionen Menschen abhängig sind

Gesundheitsversorgung und andere Bedürfnisse angewiesen sind so Lowcock Die Hilfsorganisationen hätten bisher etwa 18 Prozent dessen erhalten was für den diesjährigen humanitären Hilfsplan benötigt werde Die Wirtschaft des Jemen befinde sich im freien Fall mit steigenden Preisen und Treibstoffknappheit die unter anderem durch die Hafenblockade in alHudaida bedingt sei warnte Lowcock Allerdings drohe jetzt der brüchige Tanker vor der Küste den Hafen für Wochen oder Monate außer Betrieb zu setzen wenn die 11 Millionen Barrel Rohöl auslaufen würden viermal so viel wie bei der ExxonValdezKatastrophe im Jahr 1989 Lowcock appellierte auch an die Nachbarn des Jemen am Golf ihre Unterstützung zu verstärken Der starke Rückgang der Zahlungen aus den Golfstaaten in diesem Jahr sei

increased scrutiny as more nations recognize the need for international solidarity amid the global coronavirus disease pandemic Rob Miller director of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign told Sputnik on Monday Miller said this was a welcome development in longrunning efforts to change US policy in the region given that Washington is attempts to pressure other countries into rejecting Cuban medical aid have at times proved fruitless The political situation has opened up some doors on the question of the blockade and has further isolated the position of the US administration on Cuba he said A team of 52 Cuban doctors and nurses traveled to the Italian region of Lombardy in late March and Miller stated that this was despite the US State Department is efforts to dissuade countries from receiving help from the Caribbean country You have got Cuban medical brigades now in many different countries including countries that normally would not have Cubans there such as Italy That is despite the fact that the US State Department issued a statement trying to warn governments off cooperating with Cuba during this pandemic he said The Cuba Solidarity Campaign has to date accrued over 15000 signatures including from major figures like Len McCluskey head of Britain is biggest trade union Unite demanding the UK government add pressure to their US counterparts to ease the blockade Such moves were being strengthened the campaign director claimed in light of recent calls from both UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres and Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya to effectively lift sanctions from targeted countries for the duration of the pandemic The fact that such efforts to discourage nations from accepting Cuban aid was further evidence of Washington is mounting isolation when it came to Cuba Miller argued a fact that was becoming more and more evident in both diplomatic circles and wider civil society You have got a situation where US diplomats are engaging in pressuring countries around the world saying they should not have medical cooperation with Cuba otherwise it could affect their relationship with the United States he said The campaign director added that there was a clear divide emerging between the US and its allies and that international cooperation was crucial during the ongoing epidemiological and economic crisis But there is a clear divide there between some western allies and the United States At a time of humanitarian crisis it would be far better for countries to cooperate rather than imposing blockades and sanctions So there is a growing call for cooperation he said In particular Russia and China have been particularly vocal about the need to remove the US blockade on the Caribbean country Miller said A whole host of countries including Russia and China have called for an end to the blockade at this time as have lots of civil society groups plus 50 members of parliament over here UK So there is a growing opposition to the blockade that is taking place at a time of humanitarian crisis he added The US blockade itself has however had a serious impact on Cuba is capacity to deal with more than 1000 domestic cases of COVID19 he claimed Despite having an amazing health service in terms of primary care and disease prevention the country struggles when it comes to importing advanced medical equipment an obstacle caused by the continuance of the US blockade he stated Cuba is finding it very difficult to buy ventilators in particular plus PPE personal protective equipment So it is difficult for Cuba to access those products in a situation of blockade Miller said Consequently the lifting of the blockade would allow Cuba to purchase the equipment necessary to meet the challenges posed by COVID19 and any future outbreaks of infectious disease he said They have got a very clear control system to deal with this but what they have not got are the more highend facilities for people who need more acute treatment That puts an incredible strain on Cuba in a situation where they are doing the best they can but it would be a lot easier if there were some humanitarian assistance and cooperation across borders which is being blocked by the United States Miller stated UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres on March 24 called for the G20 countries to lift sanctions so that countries can ensure deliveries of food and essential health supplies UN UnderSecretaryGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock and General Assembly President Tijjani MuhammadBande echoed the secretarygeneral is sentiments and urged for countries to lift sanctions amid the ongoing global pandemic However a Russiadrafted General Assembly resolution calling for solidarity and global sanctions relief was blocked last week by the US EU UK Ukraine and Georgia

the Middle East on the ground in Syria Egypt Iraq and Palestine while also covering the conflict in Yemen since 2015 Follow her on Twitter VanessaBeeley On April 27 at around five in the morning Israel targeted residential areas of southern Damascus killing three civilians injuring four and causing significant material damage to homes The attack was carried out by Israeli warplanes unlawfully hijacking Lebanese airspace to fire their missiles into Damascus suburbs It is the fourth such attack in the past month two having taken place in the same week Israeli media used the typical selfdefencemission arguments to justify the aggression The EUfunded UKbased Syrian Observatory for Human Rights SOHR announced in lockstep with Israeli media statements that the missiles had hit positions controlled by Iran and their proxies and that four unknownnationality gunmen had been killed in the raid Israel exploits Covid19 disruption to further its regional agenda Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett bellicose as ever warned that Israel would not allow the establishment of an advanced Iranian base in Syria Images that were circulated immediately after the attack depicted scenes of civilians returning to inspect the damage not of Iranian militia These called into doubt the familiar Israeli claims of selfpreservation while attacking a sovereign nation from airspace it does not control and where it is not welcome A recent article written for the Brookings Institution funded by Qatar and Bill Gates among other US corporate heavyweights outlines Israels changing regional landscape in light of Covid19 Effectively Israel will attempt to seize the opportunity to double down on an already expanding collaboration with the Gulf States to combat the perceived threat of Iran they both face One interpretation of the article is that Covid19 offers Israel the opportunity to capitalize on HezbollahSyrianIranian distraction and the reshuffling of resources towards Covid19 to strike at the heart of its alliance in Syria This is being borne out by the uptick in aggression These violations of international law committed by Israel are not the only ones being conducted by the USled alliance which has for almost 10 years maintained a military and economic campaign to topple the Syrian government The entire region is reeling from the Covid19 pandemic that has swept the globe fuelled by an unprecedented media fear campaign that has driven multiple states into lockdown and isolation with borders closed and movement curtailed Yet the US alliance has militarily ignored its own domesticpolicy diktats which have effectively put the majority of the American population under house arrest US troop deployment and increased military footprint in northeast Syria Veteran journalist Abdel Bari Atwan has reported that US intelligence agencies and Washingtons regional allies are exploiting the Covid19 diversion to consolidate control over Syrian oil resources east of the Euphrates with the help of their Syrian Democratic Forces SDF proxies in the province According to locals in the area the US is not only plundering Syrian oil wealth but also profiting from the regional agricultural abundance or rather it is relying on its mercenaries to selfsustain economically through the looting and resale of Syrian resources In the long run this saves it the trouble of paying the militia acting under its jurisdiction A steady stream of US militaryvehicle convoys loaded with military and logistical equipment have been reinforcing US military presence in the northeast in particular Qamishli converging on the illegal US base in Qassrak Tel Baidar According to SOHR a Turkish military convoy of an estimated 20 military vehicles has entered Idlib province in northwest Syria in the past two days This brings the number of vehicles that have entered Syria since the new RussiaDamascusTurkeybrokered ceasefire in March to 2830 All these convoys also generate an increase in troop presence despite the restrictions on movement imposed by Covid19 health recommendations which appear not to apply to military personnel Such disrespect to Syrias borders is effectively increasing the risks of spreading Covid19 in a country that has endured almost 10 years of an externally sponsored war and decades of punishing economic sanctions These conditions put Syria at high risk if the virus is irresponsibly introduced into already wardebilitated and displaced communities Raqqa is also apparently on the US road map for reoccupation Syrian war analyst Ibrahim Mohammad has informed me that terrorist media outlets sympathetic to the SDF have reported the arrival of an international team of military experts in a base west of Raqqa The aim of this team is to assess the possibility of a redeployment of US troops to the area they militarily pulverised allegedly to liberate it from ISIS in 2018 Simultaneously a team of US coalition military personnel has been dispatched to the Khrab Ashq base in the countryside of AinAlArab northeast of Aleppo Observers report the arrival of trucks carrying concrete blocks to fortify the former US base in preparation for the return of US troops It is worth noting that Syria is not the destabilized nation it was when the US initiated its basebuilding campaign on Syrian sovereign territory an act of banditry that went largely unremarked on by Western media The local Syrian pushback against Washingtons reoccupation policy has been given impetus by the Syrian Arab Armys allied victories against the extremist armed groups in the past five years The looting of Syrian resources is not confined to USbacked militant structures Turkish proxies are also exploiting the Covid19 lull to strip the AlGhab area in northwest Hama bordering Idlib of its water and irrigation pipes for resale in Turkey The AlNusra Front is accused of dismantling the remains of Zayzoun power plant and Idlib textile factories for sale to Turkish scrapmetal dealers presumably to fund AlQaedas military occupation of Idlib Even ISIS has been emboldened by the Covid19 shutdown ISIS terrorists afforded protection from government pursuit by the proximity of the US military base at AlTanf on the border with Jordan swarmed to attack the eastern countryside of Homs during April 2020 Although the attack was repelled by the Syrian Arab Army it is indicative of the spoiler role the US will now play to maintain pressure on the Syrian government and military unaffected by the expectation that a more humanitarian response would be appropriate while the world is battling Covid19 Sanctions Rampedup hybrid war to bring Syria to her knees The Syrian government has been effective in its handling of the Covid19 situation Pragmatic precautions have been taken and medical institutions ministries hospitals and industrial sectors have combined forces and resources to protect the Syrian population with excellent results Syria has 43 official cases of coronavirus 19 recoveries and three deaths a remarkably low number for a country that the West expected or hoped would buckle under the strain Rather than respond positively to the humanitarian crisis generated by Covid19 a crisis that impacts most severely upon the Syrian people the US has effectively maintained its maximum pressure campaign tightening the sanction screws rather than releasing them According to local reports the Syrian economy is losing 1 trillion Syrian pounds SYP per month thats around 333 billion SYP per day after the suspension of activity in most economic sectors as part of the measures adopted to fight Covid19 According to Syrian economist Ali Kanan losses amounted to 2 trillion SYP in March and April and will rise to an estimated 4 trillion SYP if the lockdown extends until June 2020 The Syrian government is responding proactively to the dramatic economic downturn allocating for example 15 billion SYP to the agricultural sector in an attempt to support and protect the Syrian economy during these extraordinary times However the timing of the Covid19 media and UN agency hype is turning out to be very convenient for the US coalition which was about to have to concede the humiliating defeat of its regimechange campaign as a final military victory was in sight for the Syrian state and its allies The former French ambassador to Damascus Professor Michel Raimbaud argues rightly that sanctions are more barbaric than military confrontation which is nearing an end it is illegal and immoral It is a stain on humanity For Washington and its allies in the UK and EU to maintain sanctions during the Covid19 crisis is nothing more than deliberate economic savagery The situation is apparently being intentionally exploited to push Syria over the edge and into an economic abyss which serves only the farfromhumanitarian agenda of the USdominated globalist nations that are jockeying for hegemony in the region Covid19 has brought into sharp relief the USalliance humanitarian fig leaf that is enabling perpetual war across the world It is nothing more than barbaric that its sadistic economic policies remain firmly in place during an unprecedented global crisis Whether this crisis is real exaggerated or orchestrated it is the people who are suffering and the US coalition is exploiting their suffering for its own ends Think your friends would be interested Share this story

country is already overstretched healthcare system Jennifer Bose Ratka public information officer at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA in Libya saidA possible outbreak of the virus would be catastrophic Libya is at high risk of the spread of COVID19 given its growing levels of insecurity political fragmentation weak health system and high numbers of migrants refugees and internally displaced persons Libyas already overstretched health system is not ready to deal with a spread of the virus in this fragile context caused by the protracted conflict Ratka said The first COVID19 case was confirmed in Libya on March 25 The country is response measures risk being greatly undermined by a longlasting conflict between two rival administrations in the east and the west with ongoing occasional armed hostilities As Libyan hospitals continue to take in injured fighters following a consistently ignored ceasefire in 2020 these medical establishments will now have to brace for the task of containment of COVID19 The lack of wellequipped intensive care units and medical equipment means that the country will struggle to deal with a major outbreak With an already weak health system and with most Libyans seeking health care abroad the implications of a serious COVID19 outbreak in Libya could be catastrophic Ratka said Last week UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres called upon the rival governments to lay down arms and adhere to the temporary draft ceasefire agreement negotiated by the Libyan Joint Military Commission 55 in the face of the COVID19 pandemic On Humanitarian Barriers Amid COVID19 Curfews The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA in Libya has received 164 reports from humanitarian actors about access difficulties brought about by COVID19 related curfews according to the official Ongoing clashes along with COVID19 restriction measures hamper humanitarian access to those who need assistance and the free movement of medical and other humanitarian personnel in the country We received 164 reports from various humanitarian actors on access constraints linked with the COVID19 related curfews being imposed in East West and South Libya Ratka said Earlier this week another international humanitarian agency the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR announced it would suspend some of its operations in Libya particularly with regard to activities in refugee arrival centres and detention facilities in light of the shortage of personal protective equipment of its staff It has sparked concerns within the migrant community in Libya that they would end up cut off from international aid OCHA is not scaling back and our staff is fully engaged supporting the development of preparedness and response plans bolstering coordination and providing information management services Ratka said She said the agency had taken measures to change the way it operates in line with WHO and national guidelines to minimize the risk of viral transmissions particularly be adhering to a donoharm approach that includes remote coordination by virtual means and increased social distancing on the ground With almost 900000 people in Libya in need of emergency assistance we are here to support the response to the pandemic and ensure that we can continue to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable including refugees migrants and displaced people Ratka said On Very Limited Funds Available in Libya Amid COVID19 The shortage of funds available for Libya to tackle the coronavirus disease pandemic is a further strain on the wartorn country is weakened economy with humanitarian access difficulties Jennifer Bose Ratka said Very limited funds are available for preparedness and response activities in Libya to date despite announcements for support while the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan is only 2 percent Ratka said The 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan that she mentioned was launched by the United Nations on Wednesday to stream some 2 billion into the worlds most vulnerable countries for handling the spread of COVID19 Coordinated by OCHA it brings together appeals from the World Health Organization and other UN humanitarian agencies Ratka said the pandemic was already compounding Libyas tenuous economic situation and this will likely significantly hamper the humanitarian response to the broader Libya crisis specifically with regard to assistance to migrants refugees and more than 345000 people located in the conflict is frontline areas which per se makes them even more vulnerable to COVID19Through our coordination mandate our role is to minimize the humanitarian consequences of COVID19 and work with humanitarian partners to ensure we continue to deliver the most critical services to the most vulnerable people Ratka continued According to her OCHA is assistance in Libya covers the coordination of medical equipment and tests handwashing stations and other sanitation support essential public information campaigns training for national health workers and logistics

Asia and Pacific region He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions is a New Zealandbased legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East Asia and Pacific region He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions Israel continues to occupy Palestine but is falling far short of its international obligations to help the Palestinian people weather the storm of Covid19 Can we expect the global community to step in or will they stay silent If Covid19 is allowed to proliferate throughout the Gaza Strip the result will be nothing short of chaos Gaza is full of vulnerable groups and refugee camps and it has a large number of poor and densely populated areas The tools the Palestinian Administration needs to combat the virus are already in short supply as are medical staff While the number of confirmed cases is significantly higher in Israel Israel is better equipped with the necessary resources to contain the virus in the longer term As of writing the number of recorded Covid19 cases in the Palestinian Administration has risen to 466 Two new cases have been recorded in the Gaza Strip bringing the total number of cases in this heavily populated area to 17 Approximately a week ago the number of confirmed cases there was only 41 and at the time there were concerns that the virus was spreading undetected throughout the Palestinian Administration All things considered Id be greatly surprised if any of these numbers told the whole story According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA the low numbers thus far reflect limited testing capacity more than anything else As the occupying power Israel tinkers heavily with the goods and services Palestinians can receive that you or I may take for granted on a daily basis In the Gaza Strip electricity is usually available for less than half the day 97 percent of its drinking water is contaminated with sewage and salt the supply of which is also controlled by Israel If Covid19 begins to spread rapidly across a population of approximately two million people trapped in what is widely regarded as an openair prison it doesnt take a mathematician to work out that the number of ventilators it has currently less than 100 is simply not enough Despite all of this Israeli officials have said that Palestinians have largely abided by the lockdown measures In fact Jerusalems highest rates of confirmed Covid19 cases appear to be centered in its most ultraorthodox Jewish neighborhoods With this in mind one would expect the Israeli government to have been working closely with the Palestinian Authority to help contain the spread of the virus No The World Health Organization WHO has officially accused Israel of denying Palestinians access to vital medicine perhaps this is why Trump threatened to defund the WHO Moreover according to Electronic Intifada Israeli occupation forces have been attacking Palestinian communities even throughout the pandemic Homes and schools have been raided Palestinians have been detained including local emergencycommittee members food parcels have been confiscated and assaults have been committed Israel has also continued to target water sanitation and hygiene facilities as well as agricultural and livelihood structures in the occupied West Bank as it further cements its plans to demolish Palestinian homes and forcibly remove the Palestinian population Even up until the end of March reports indicate that Israel has routinely bombed Gaza during this crisis as well Much of this continues to take place without so much as a blink from the UN or the international community for that matter While I note that most major Western powers have their own problems to deal with in the face of the pandemic I cant help but notice that the US still has the time energy and resources to continue to build up its naval presence in the Caribbean in a bid to unseat Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro Ah but then again the US has donated a whopping 5 million to the Palestinian Authority to assist in its efforts to defeat the Covid19 pandemic This is after the US had already cut more than 200 million in aid to the Palestinian Administration in 2018 and withheld 75 million in humanitarian aid which was supposed to be delivered this year The World Bank has predicted that if Palestine is unable to control the spread of Covid19 in four months its GDP will shrink by at least seven percent this year A quarter of Palestinians were already living on less than 550 a day with about a quarter of their population unemployed What we are seeing with respect to Palestine and the blockade imposed on Gaza by Egypt and Israel is a doubleedged sword If the numbers so far have been correct and the number of confirmed cases continues to remain low it would suggest that we may find ourselves in a situation whereby the Palestinians may be able to avoid an unmitigated disaster For much of the Palestinian population the lockdown we have all been experiencing globally over the last few weeks is part and parcel of everyday life However this will only be something to celebrate if the pandemic is unable to take root and fails to continue its path of spreading unabated like wildfire Because if that does happen the infrastructure simply isnt there to help the Palestinians cope nor is the international assistance they require Perhaps this is what the UN meant when it predicted that Gaza would be uninhabitable by 2020 While this is a vision for the future of the Palestinian Administration which may reflect the deepest desires of Jared Kushner and of Benjamin Netanyahu one would hope that saner heads can prevail during this calamitous time That being said in a world where increasingly useless celebrities preach to us through a virtual lens to be kind to one another I cant say Im expecting any one of them to speak out in support of the Palestinian struggle any time

emergencies which when combined threaten to bring the nation to its knees The United States has over the years sought to destabilize Iran in hopes that it would collapse from within clearing the way for a new proWestern government The current maximum pressure campaign built around stringent economic sanctions targeting virtually every aspect of the Iranian economy is designed to not only bring Iran to the negotiating table but to drive its leadership from power The chances of such an outcome today however are slim The Iranian government has proven itself to be quite resilient and the very policies that the US is pursuing in Iran may turn out to be counterproductive rallying Iranians around their embattled government Also on rtcomOne Iranian dies of coronavirus every 10 minutes 50 get infected every hour health ministryThis is not to say that the domestic political situation inside Iran is ideal for the governmentfar from it The economic crisis in Iran brought on by US sanctions has led to a loss of confidence in the moderate government of President Hassan Rouhani leading to the election of a conservative parliamentary majority on February 21 The percentage of Iranians who actively participated in this election was around 425 percent a nearly 20 percentagepoint decline from the previous legislative election in 2016 The low electoral turnout was a clearcut vote of no confidence on the part of the Iranian people in their system of government In addition to crippling US sanctions an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia which began on March 9 has gutted Irans already fragile economy further testing the frayed relationship between the Iranian people and their government And if this wasnt enough Irans first case of coronavirus was detected on February 19 By March 20 about 20000 Iranians were stricken with the disease more than 1400 of whom had died The Iranian health care system was being overwhelmed with patients with no end in sight There was no

not preventing aid from getting to Iran Responding to calls from China Russia and elsewhere for the US to provide some sanctions respite for humanitarian relief from the devastating impact of the corona pandemic in Iran Hook observed that the US had sent a diplomatic note to the Iranians offering assistance with coronavirus but that this note was quickly rejected But then Hook went on to blame Irans leadership for the coronavirus outbreak saying that Tehran spends billions on terrorism and foreign wars and adding that if it had spent onetenth of this money on a better health care system the Iranian people would have been much better off As bleak as the situation looks for the people of Iran there is reason to believe that the Islamic Republic may emerge from this crisis stronger than when it entered Foreign Minister Javad Zarif hinted at this in a tweet sent out in the aftermath of Brian Hooks press briefing The US administration gleefully takes pride in killing Iranian citizens

wartorn country according to the ICRC spokesperson In addition to the raging conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 100 thousand people Yemen is also struggling to cope with constant floods and supplies of food and clean waterCoronavirus cases continue to rise in Yemen with authorities reporting that two additional people have died of the virus and 19 more people have contracted the disease in the past 24 hours So far the wartorn country has registered 28 deaths and more than 160 confirmed cases though reports allude that the numbers are much higher but authorities fear that it is only a matter of time until the situation spirals out of control Health System in Tatters The primary reason for this worry is Yemen is poor health system According to estimates Yemen has no more than 500 ventilators and 700 ICU beds nationally whereas there is only one oxygen cylinder available per month for every 25 million people Half of Yemen is health facilities are not functioning properly and about 20 percent of the country is 333 districts have no doctors To make things worse Yemen is also struggling to test all those who suspect they contracted the disease At the moment according to reports citing the World Health Organization the country has only obtained 6500 test kits with the WHO sending an additional supply of 32 thousand others but in a state where more than 40 thousand people out of the country is total 30 million population could die because of complications caused by COVID19 that amount will definitely not suffice Addressing the situation in Yemen Yara Khawaja the spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC defined the situation as catastrophic and explained that the situation could only get worse if the war which has claimed the lives of more than 100 thousand people continues The conflict in the Arab world is poorest nation kicked off in 2014 when a militant group the Houthis took over Yemen is northern and central provinces driving out the internationallyrecognised government from the country is capital Sanaa In response a coalition led by Saudi Arabia which was against having an allegedly proIranian presence on its southern border launched an air campaign in 2015 in a bid to prevent the Houthis from seizing control of Yemen is south A Long List of Problems The fiveyear war has already led to what a UN report called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world with 80 percent of the population in need of assistance and protection 70 percent are considered to be food insecure Apart from the fact that 81 percent of the country live below the poverty line and 70 percent have no access to clear water the Yemenis are suffering from a long list of other vulnerabilities said Khawaja One such threat is flooding The end of April has seen some of the most powerful floods in recent years The reports of international relief organisations have even suggested that more than 100 thousand people across Yemen have been impacted by floodwater which at times cost them the bare minimum they had The heavy rains have also led to the increase of cholera cases in the country More than 110 thousand cases have been registered so far and just as in the case of COVID19 that number is expected to grow too primarily due to the fact that Yemen does not have the means to tackle the rising challenge Not Giving Up However the Red Cross is not giving up Working in conflict zones where it tries to ensure humanitarian protection and assistance for victims of armed conflicts and other situations of violence the organisation joint efforts with other international organisations to address the multiple problems Yemen is facing including that of COVID19 that typically falls under the jurisdiction of the WHO Our regular activities in Yemen happen to align with what is needed in terms of COVID19 prevention For example our water engineers are working to facilitate the Yemenis access to clean water our teams distribute various hygiene items specifically in camps housing internally displaced persons and in the country is hot spots to make sure diseases stay at bay from those areas Khawaja explained In addition throughout the years the ICRC has supported a large number of hospitals and various health care centres and has even set up 19 oxygen stations aimed at helping local medical services tackle the various respiratory diseases including COVID19 that have become common in Yemen Unfortunately it seems that it is only the beginning of COVID19 in Yemen and it will put additional pressure on the already fragile system and infrastructure that have been weakened by the conflict To curb the spread of the disease and prevent a humanitarian disaster we join efforts with others and spread awareness passing messages on how to implement precautionary measures that would keep the population safe Khawaja concluded

20200409_RU_RT_GNAPI65542.txt,Raw text/RUClean/20200409_RU_RT_GNAPI65542.txt,RU,RT,20200409,17,Both exist in parallel universes This is why most Englishspeaking Russians usually react with a mixture of shock and horror when their language skills become proficient enough to read what the foreign press is writing about their homeland Now predictably Russias response to Covid19 is being weaponized as part of the mythical information war This is because Western media coverage of the country generally isnt about journalism instead its about activism This means that only Russians who fit its narrative are given agency For this reason Alexei Navalny is presented as the opposition leader despite the fact there is no united opposition in Russia and other oppositionists have never selected him to lead them To make it even more ridiculous Navalnys support lies at between one and two percent in Russian opinion polls considerably behind Pavel Grudinin for example who basically doesnt exist to consumers of the Western press Grudinin is a former Communist Party presidential candidate and when Russian outlets reported that he was blocked from entering parliament the State Duma last year US and UK media essentially ignored his travails presumably for fear of disrupting its narrative To appreciate the strange symbiosis between Navalny and the Western media we need to look at maneuvering around the Covid19 pandemic Eager to attack reaction to the Kremlins response some hacks have attached themselves to the Doctors Alliance a tiny yet influential motley crew union of medical workers closely linked to the man himself So much so in fact that its led by Navalnys former personal ophthalmologist Anastasia Vasilyeva On the other hand Russias biggest medical union the Health Workers Union of the Russian Federation HWURF is entirely anonymous in Western coverage despite its membership totaling around three million Breaking rules First a disclaimer A politically active workers union is nothing bad In fact it is undoubtedly a positive as is any desire to help out a medical system that is often critically understocked and has the potential to be entirely overwhelmed by the coronavirus The fact is after almost three decades of hyperneoliberal economics initially egged on by the West working conditions for doctors in Russian state hospitals are generally poor Whats more nobody can deny that many hospitals in the country need a lot of help to get up to a reasonable acceptable standard Thus this argument isnt about unions as a concept and does not assert that there are no problems with the Russian healthcare system There are many Instead its about a group of activists masquerading as a union who are not actively seeking to improve the life of doctors Instead of actually helping out Vasilyevas associates seem to be more interested in wooing the West On April 3 Vasilyeva and eleven other colleagues set off for Russias Novgorod Region about 400km away from Moscow ostensibly to deliver muchneeded personal protective equipment for overworked doctors Vasilyevas group broke strict quarantine laws designed to stop the spread of Covid19 to bring boxes of material masks respirators and suits to two local hospitals The funding was collected as part of a new project called the AllRussian Medical Inspectorate which says it aims to supply doctors with vital equipment However at the entrance to the town of Okulovka just inside the state oblast border the Doctors Alliance convoy of four cars with three people in each so much for social distancing was escorted by local police to the station where they were kept overnight All because Vasilyeva is the most prominent critic of Russias response to the coronavirus Well thats what youd think if you relied on Western media to explain Russia In reality the story is quite different Vasilyeva left her home in Moscow a city now under strict quarantine with over 6000 reported Covid19 on the pretext of providing medical care As she has no registration in the Novgorod Region which has 12 registered coronavirus infections she knew she would be breaking the law before she had even crossed the regional frontier It was publicly broadcast that Novgorod is presently locked down due to fear of infection Thus its clear Vasilyeva knew she would be arrested Indeed the makeup of her eleven comrades essentially betrays that fact it included a lawyer a foreigner and three cameramen rather than a full complement of working unionized doctors Aside from breaching coronavirus rules she was also charged with disobeying the requests of a police officer not getting out of her car and refusing an instruction to come to the police station to make a report According to the Doctors Alliance her arrest was real fascism If the goal was just to send equipment to a hospital she could quietly have done it without breaking the law and creating a scene All she had to do was simply send money electronically to local volunteers or arrange a special delivery But its clear this was about PR Furthermore on his personal online blog Doctors Alliance cheerleader Alexei Navalny posted a document from the Ministry of Emergencies listing the problems of medical institutions in each region The PDF detailed issues in many different areas of the country varying from mild to quite severe and is an eyeopener to the difficulties Russia is facing in its battle against coronavirus But Novgorod Region where Vasilyeva went No shortages reported Presumably the likes of Tomsk Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan which appear to urgently need help are too far away to be worth the effort for these activists Subsequently the head physician of the Borovichi Hospital one of the two hospitals Vasilyeva supplied recorded a video explaining that he did not know the original source of the equipment Anastasia arrived from the city of Moscow where there are mass quarantine measures regarding the infection of Covid19 without any precautions At the same time she allegedly brought humanitarian aid in the form of medical masks Again it is not clear from which warehouses these masks are from They had neither certificates nor registrations Vadim Ladyagin said Another head physician in Novgorod Region Natalya Usatova of the Valdai Central District Hospital told regional website 53 News that the local doctors didnt understand Vasilyevas actions If we actually did not have enough special protection this could be done differently This is a provocation there is no other name for it We the doctors did not understand this trick Even we dont allow ourselves to move around the region Usatova said After all it is possible to clarify with the minister what we need and to involve volunteers in this work The entire process in the region to combat coronavirus is controlled personally by the minister and the governor Una voce Despite these facts Vasilyeva immediately used her arrest as a pretext to engage with foreign media outlets Vasilyeva spoke with the Associated Press who uncritically titled their piece Russia detains activists trying to help hospital amid virus She told the news agency that the arrest was about breaking her With the outbreak dominating the agenda in Russia anyone who criticizes the countrys struggling health system becomes a thorn in the Kremlins side but DrAnastasy told me she will keep on helping hospitals in need of PPE even after a brutal arrest Dasha Litvinova dashalitvinovv April 3 2020 Next Vasilyeva chatted to the Moscow Times which despite the name is a Dutch title not a Russian one She told them that she was taking the governments work into her own hands I profiled DrAnastasy who along with her Doctors Alliance union alyansvrachey has become the loudest critic of the Kremlin is coronavirus response What were doing is helping our government Theyre not doing this work so were taking it on ourselves Evan Gershkovich evangershkovich April 4 2020 The New York Times also picked up Vasilyevas story with its headline suggesting that she was detained after questioning official numbers ignoring her illegal and unsafe quarantinebreaking You can send whomever you want to get me the Federal Security Service the fire service but the truth will not change said a Russian doctor who has accused officials of lying about the real number of coronavirus infections New York Times World nytimesworld April 3 2020 The Doctors Alliance was also quick to get in contact with US state media Unsurprisingly RFERL painted Vasilyeva as a hero A Doctors Alliance spokesman told me it has gathered 3 mln rubles in donations 40k since its campaign to equip doctors launched on Monday But as Putin is govt ships medical aid to Italy the US it may well be wary of Vasilieva highlighting the state of healthcare at home Matthew Luxmoore mjluxmoore April 3 2020 However perhaps most impressive is Vasilyevas penchant for bringing foreign journalists along on her journeys On her trip to Okulovka she took Steven Derix from NRC Handelsblad a wellknown newspaper in the Netherlands According to Derix she was driving without the correct documentation Presumably she just forgot to bring it with her De artsen van de vakbond die beschermende kleding wilden uitdelen aan coronaartsen in de Russische provincie moeten naar het bureau voor een proces verbaal De auto van voorzitter DrAnastasy wordt weggesleept ze is de papieren vergeten pictwittercomVleVFMSBgY Steven Derix StevenDerix April 2 2020 In January the Doctors Alliance took another Western journalist on a trip Marc Bennetts of the UKs Times newspaper Vasilyeva brought Bennetts to the small Urals town of Bogdanovich where there was coincidentally another clash with the cops Before arriving in the Sverdlovsk Region town she made a public statement about the intention of hospital workers to start a strike in response to the poor working conditions In reality there was no strike of medical personnel at all just four laundry workers in their admittedly awful and rundown laundry room According to the hospital management and officials of the regional Ministry of Health there were also no complaints from doctors Even Navalnys video of the strike showed the small size of the disgruntled workforce Like so many of Russias hospitals especially in poorer remote towns and cities Bogdanovichs is clearly in need of repair While nobody would argue that the Russian healthcare system does not need a huge boost the question remains If the Doctors Alliance is really a union and the goal is to draw mass attention to the problems of the healthcare system why not bring a Russian journalist The inclusion of Bennetts on Vasilyevas Urals jaunt could lead one to believe that the Doctors Alliance is not a trade union at all but a vehicle to show foreigners how much Russia sucks After all how does an article in English not Russian carried by a British newspaper advance the cause of improvements to healthcare in the Urals thousands of miles from London Especially given that the Times is paywalled with its content available only to subscribers How many people in Moscow let alone in the Sverdlovsk region were likely to see the report Elephant in the room Russia has some huge and established medical unions so why is Western media pushing a fringe activist group with a tiny membership Like many countries Russia is home to several professional trade unions that fight for the rights of their members Unions are undoubtedly a good thing for workers and offer strong protection against illegal dismissal and abuse in the workplace As a rule unions are stronger when they have higher membership A broader base means more collective bargaining power more effective strikes and a larger pot of money for legal defense Furthermore the larger a union is in general the more political power it has and the more press coverage it receives Why then does the Doctors Alliance and its small by their own admission membership base receive far more Western media coverage than the HWURF one of the largest unions in the country HWURF with an estimated three million members is part of the European Public Service Union EPSU a group which brings together trade unions from across Europe to influence the policies and decisions of governments throughout the continent Better still Russias health workers dont just play a token role in the continental union one of its vicepresidents is Mikhail Kuzmenko the Russian unions chairman A quick Englishlanguage Google search for HWURF brings up almost nothing but a search of Doctors Alliance leads to thousands of results Why is this The answer is simple Doctors Alliance is an activist group supported by Alexei Navalnys FBK which suits the narrative the foreign media likes to cultivate about Russia In the last month multiple media outlets such as the Washington Post NPR the Times and the New Yorker have anointed them as an independent union and theyve even fooled Lotte Leicht the EU director of Human Rights Watch To be fair at times some publications have been entirely upfront about the antigovernment bias of the union A New York Times piece from May 25 2019 mentioned the groups affiliation with Navalny calling him Russias main opposition politician Of course Navalny himself retweeted this compliment So who ARE the Doctors Union and who is Anastasia Vasilyeva A cursory Yandex search in Russian quickly brings up lots of smears about Vasilyeva and her PRloving doctors They wont be repeated here as this piece is not about her its about the Western medias reporting So lets stick to the known facts In 2017 Alexei Navalny was attacked by a man who sprayed a caustic green antiseptic at the protest leader The reprehensible attack was a bad moment for Navalny but a moment of opportunity for Vasilyeva who worked as his ophthalmologist According to Vasilyeva in early 2018 her mother was fired from her position at a medical research university in Moscow and she went to Navalny for help Navalny offered his lawyers and her mother got her job back This was the beginning of a brandnew partnership and they clubbed together to take the Doctors Alliance nationwide However it seems real doctors are just not that interested in the work of the union According to an Economist article from May 2019 the Alliance only has 500 members and their website states that they have 31 different branches throughout the country However they must be somewhat low on staff as according to their website Vasilyeva is the regional representative for at least 15 of those branches ranging from Kamchatka to Crimea and from Kaliningrad to Magadan The distance between the latter pair is over 11000km by road Theres not a real union on earth which would expect a local organizer to cover that sort of ground This is a clear example of why the Doctors Alliance has no practical domestic utility Ignored in Russia With their continual wooing of the West a casual follower would be forgiven for believing that the Doctors Alliance has already conquered Russia and international attention is the next frontier This is of course demonstrably false Although Navalny and Vasilyeva have Western correspondents in Moscow at their beck and call Russian media doesnt seem all that interested While foreign journalists clamor to write full featurelength profiles of Vasilyeva and her fellow activists they only seem to pop up in Russian media when staging provocations Even oppositionleaning outlets such as Echo Moscow and Novaya Gazeta dont seem to care For example the Echo print article about Vasilyevas recent court case was only two paragraphs long although she does appear quite often on its sister radio station The New York Times piece about her arrest 29 paragraphs What about ordinary Russians on the internet Well despite their polished online presence the Doctors Alliance has a somewhat abrasive style towards those who ask questions especially those who query the finances One VKontakte user was blocked by the union after asking for the names of the equipment suppliers and to see the receipts Despite their shadiness and zero domestic support it seems the goal of Navalny and Vasilyeva has been achieved international acclaim and popularity The plight of the union has attracted attention across the globe Former Estonian president and erstwhile US state media reporter Toomas Hendrik Ilves tweeted his support for Vasilyeva hinting that her April 2020 arrest was due to her questioning the Kremlins official Covid19 figures Britainbased INGO Amnesty International was also conned by the group believing that the Russian authorities fear criticism more than the deadly Covid19 pandemic The Amnesty article omitted many critical aspects of the case distorting the picture in favor of Vasilyeva It is staggering that the Russian authorities appear to fear criticism more than the deadly COVID19 pandemic The Russian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Anastasia Vasilyeva Amnesty International amnesty April 3 2020 While the union is essentially unknown within Russia and to speakers of the Russian language its fame has gone global in the anglosphere Despite the fact it has little support in the medical community and has achieved no real change Vasilyeva and the Doctors Alliance have won The Western press is eating out the palm of their hand and thats the real objective Once again there two Russias the one 146 million people live in and the fantasy version Western media presents to its readers Like this story Share it with a friend

continue to cite the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to block Damascus efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to northwestern Syria Russian Permanent Envoy to the United Nations Office in Geneva Gennady Gatilov told Izvestia According to him the West fears that the Syrians delivering humanitarian supplies will also bring COVID19 to Idlib However when it comes to a crossborder mechanism promoted by Germany and Belgium the pandemic threat seems to fade away Gatilov pointed out that the Americans and their allies actively seek to take advantage of the humanitarian issue to achieve their own political goals in Syria The goal is in fact to undermine the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity particularly through creating political and economic preferences for areas not controlled by Damascus It is well known that militants from antigovernment groups are in charge there the envoy specified Similarly Gatilov noted that the West ignores the fact that domestic humanitarian routes to northeastern Syria have been operating steadily for six months By pursuing such a policy the West clearly seeks to continue providing support to militants active in areas that the countrys legitimate government doesnt control with an eye on annexing these territories Illegal unilateral sanctions are being used as a tool to achieve this goal as they continue to worsen the living conditions of Syrians the diplomat said He emphasized that Russia would steadily oppose that politicized agenda which ran counter to the United Nations Charter However it doesnt mean that Moscow will obstruct efforts to boost humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people If our Western colleagues really want to help Syrians living in areas not controlled by the government then they should facilitate domestic humanitarian aid activities The Syrian authorities are ready for meaningful work like that the Russian envoy concluded Vedomosti Fighting continues to rage along AzerbaijanArmenia border The clashes that broke out on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan on July 12 are still raging on Russia has called on both parties to exercise restraint and expressed its willingness to act as a mediator Vedomosti wrote Senior Research Fellow from MGIMO University is Caucasian Studies Center Nikolai Silayev pointed out that this is the biggest military engagement since April 2016 According to him the 2018 change of government in Armenia was expected to have a positive impact on the negotiation process but now the situation is going back to square one The expert noted that it was important for Armenia and the NagornoKarabakh region to maintain the status quo as Azerbaijan had lost control of Karabakh almost 30 years ago In contrast Baku seeks to make sure that no one gets used to the status quo Out of the two options Azerbaijan had it chose military tensions over talks However people get used even to constant military strife so Baku has to send stronger signals Silayev explained The fact that the incident took place on the very border between Azerbaijan and Armenia and not in Karabakh points to a stronger signal Instead of Karabakh it concerns Armenia which is in a military and political alliance with Russia and is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization CSTO he noted However Silayev believes that the CSTO will avoid getting dragged into the quagmire On the other hand unlike other mediators the US and France the cochairs of the OSCE Minsk Group Russia maintains trustbased relations with both parties This balanced approach makes it possible for Russia to act as a mediator Combat activities ended in April 2016 after a Moscowhosted meeting between the two countries chiefs of the general staff the expert emphasized Izvestia Five years on Iran sees no reason to maintain nuke deal This July 15 marks five years since Iran Russia China France Germany the United Kingdom and the United States signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA which limited the development of Iran is nuclear program in exchange for the gradual removal of sanctions imposed on the country by the UN Security Council Izvestia writes Moscow believes that it would be unreasonable to amend the JCPOA or sign a new deal Russian Ambassador to Tehran Levan Dzhagaryan told the newspaper The agreement needs to come into force for real so that it can demonstrate its full potential However it has not happened yet because of the unilateral US withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 I am sure that if Washington refrained from this unconstructive move the plan would have led to the desired result the ambassador stressed adding that Russia urged its Iranian friends to exercise restraint Meanwhile Iranian Ambassador to Moscow Kazem Jalali told the paper that Tehran saw no use in maintaining the JCPOA According to the envoy the agreement was supposed to be beneficial to all parties but given the US move to undermine the deal there is no benefit in sight A meeting between the remaining participants seems necessary in such a situation but no agreement has been reached on that matter yet Jalali noted Although the JCPOA has been in a state of lethargy for two years the mechanism continues to operate dejure The socalled arms embargo will expire in October and restrictions on Irans purchase and sale of any weapons will be lifted Andrei Baklitsky an analyst with the Institute for International Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations believes that the move to extend or end the embargo has a more symbolic meaning but it will give each of the parties a chance to score political points The political commentator explained that it was crucial for Iran to show its ability to achieve foreign policy goals and resist US pressure As for Washington it seeks to prove that Iran wont get any advantages However the situation is complicated by the upcoming presidential elections that will take place in the US in November 2020 and in Iran in 2021 Nezavisimaya Gazeta Middle East to face brewing protest sentiment The International Monetary Fund IMF has trimmed its economic forecasts for Middle East and North African nations due to the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in oil prices According to a recent IMF report the crisis may lead to an increase in antigovernment sentiment in the region Nezavisimaya Gazeta notes Even before the coronavirus crisis broke out the IMFs forecasts for some of the countries of the region were far from optimistic The funds winter report on the economic situation of the Gulf Cooperation Council nations said that their financial wellbeing might dry up in 15 years Experts explained that declining oil demand was one of the main reasons Now the situation has significantly deteriorated particularly in social terms Senior Researcher at Higher School of Economics Alisa Shishkina points out however that as a rule there is no direct link between the sluggish figures of economic development and protests in Arab countries If we look at indicators such as the GDP poverty and unemployment levels we will see that countries involved in the Arab Spring were in a situation similar to that of some European nations the analyst noted It was not the unemployment factor on its own but youth unemployment that was the reason behind protests particularly unemployment among young people with university degrees who were dissatisfied with their social standing she emphasized If countries fail to clarify their approach to the labor market unemployment and education amid the current crisis as well as reshape existing educational programs then I think that the forecast will come true and we will see a new round of protest activities in the coming 20 years Shishkina predicted On the whole the trend for population growth job cuts and the education systems collapse makes the latest IMF forecast look credible the expert pointed out Vedomosti Russians ready to travel to the office less often The actual number of Russians who moved to remote work amid the coronavirus pandemic has turned out to be higher than official figures Vedomosti wrote citing a poll conducted by the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration RANEPA Institute of Social Analysis and Forecasting According to Labor Minister Anton Kotyakov the rate stood at 11 while the poll showed that it was 43 Most of those who moved to telecommuting are collegeeducated employees Personnel with university degrees are capable of assuming more responsibilities managers trust them better and are more willing to let them work remotely said Yevgenia Tudaletskaya the author of a business course dubbed No Office No Problem At the same time only 37 of workers had their move to telecommuting documented officially Russias Labor Code poorly regulates issues related to remote working Ancor Operations Management Vice President Alexey Mironov pointed out The lack of regulations led to an increased workload on remote workers In particular half of those surveyed pointed to extended working hours Another 25 said that their managers had failed to organize the working process properly As many as 35 of managers in turn noted that personnel performance had declined and only six percent highlighted improvements The lack of a culture of teleworking is the reason Tudaletskaya emphasized Employers are afraid of losing control and start investing in numerous controlling tools As a result employees work more because they have to write additional reports she explained In a situation like this only one in ten respondents said they were ready to work from home Many found a combined pattern the most attractive where they can work remotely and go to the office on a regular basis TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews

Vlk shared Serbia needs help to avoid the collapse of the health system that we saw in Italy and Spain Vlk said The biggest problem is that Serbia does not produce medical equipment but buys a large part of the equipment from abroad and since all countries are burdened by the same problem procurement becomes more complicated and slower We do not have enough time she stressed Vlk pointed out that no country in the world could have been ready for such a situation and neither could Serbia But the significant difference between Serbia and European countries in the fight against coronavirus is that there is President Alexander Vucic in Serbia and that Serbia has friends she added Another major problem in Serbia is the problem with respirators the lawmaker continued Our president is trying

no international body has provided any help requested by the Syrian Democratic Council SDC SDC Representative in the US and member of Presidential Committee Bassam Saker told Sputnik North and East Syria is in a very dangerous situation We need aid and support from the international community but so far we have received absolutely no aid or support Saker said Our region does not even have the capacity to test for coronavirus let alone effectively treat or quarantine patients Saker pointed out that many people are tightly packed into refugee camps or detention centers and living in tents in conditions where the virus will spread quickly He also underlined that many more people have been living in poverty conditions especially in the nine years since the civil war began which leaves people with weakened health Our health infrastructure has been severely damaged by war and instability Every hospital clinic and health facility has been underresourced for years Saker stressed We need trained personnel we need protective equipment we need respirators We need doctors medical staff medical supplies food aid and other support Saker shared that they have been issuing urgent appeals for help to the UN the WHO and to other international organizations for weeks Despite our extreme need we have received absolutely no aid or support he revealed We will face untold death and devastation if we do not receive medical aid and other support very soon Saker went on to say that at the moment they do not know how many cases of coronavirus there are in North and East Syria because they do not have any testing methods for the virus Coronavirus is surely in our midst but we do not possess the ability to test for it It is only a matter of time before the situation turns into a tragedy on a mass scale he stated We gravely need international aid and support If we do not receive aid and support from the international community including test kits North and East Syria will be utterly devastated Saker warned that the consequences of the virus in case the region does not revives any aid can spread beyond the its borders We will face untold death and devastation if we do not receive medical aid and other support very soon The ramifications of ignoring our calls for aid may last for months and will reach far beyond our borders he said The people of North and East Syria are resilient and have so far survived the hardships of the Syrian civil war Turkish aggression and continued occupation the territorial defeat of ISIS economic devastation upheaval and betrayal by our allies But this virus is something that does not discriminate based upon strength of character Saker stressed that the Coronavirus impacts every breathing human and they are very concerned for the health and wellbeing of their people and ask for help We are trying to battle Coronavirus while under the threat of Turkish bombs landing on us If we receive no aid North and East Syria with our refugee camps Turkish aggression and damaged health infrastructure could be prove to be a hotbed for the virus leading to untold death and devastation he concluded Saker also said that The Syrian Kurds are worried about a new military operation prepared by against them in the region amid the ongoing COVID19 crisis in the world Now Turkey is taking this opportunity while the world is distracted and weakened by Coronavirus to announce a new offensive against us which they are calling Octopus Saker said Turkey is new offensive aims to occupy all of North and East Syria our entire region How can we fight this global pandemic when we Turkish and Turkishbacked forces may begin shelling us at any moment Ankara views the Kurdishled groups which are operating in northern Syria as affiliates of the PKK which is considered by Turkey to be a terrorist organization To fight them Turkey in cooperation with several Syrian opposition groups conducted a number of military operations in Syria such as the Euphrates Shield and the Olive Branch operation in the city of Afrin Damascus has condemned Ankara is military operations as a violation of Syrian sovereignty Furthermore Turkish occupation has cut off access to the medical equipment we would need to test for the virus and they have stolen many of our resources Saker said Their occupying forces and the conflict have also cut off our access

Irans New Year celebration of Nowruz finds it weathering a perfect storm of US sanctions low oil prices and Covid19 The resulting humanitarian crisis may make it even more resilient as Iranians rally around their government Iran is facing an existential crisis brought on by a combination of economic political and social emergencies which when combined threaten to bring the nation to its knees The United States has over the years sought to destabilize Iran in hopes that it would collapse from within clearing the way for a new proWestern government The current maximum pressure campaign built around stringent economic sanctions targeting virtually every aspect of the Iranian economy is designed to not only bring Iran to the negotiating table but to drive its leadership from power The chances of such an outcome today however are slim The Iranian government has proven itself to be quite resilient and the very policies that the US is pursuing in Iran may turn out to be counterproductive rallying Iranians around their embattled government This is not to say that the domestic political situation inside Iran is ideal for the governmentfar from it The economic crisis in Iran brought on by US sanctions has led to a loss of confidence in the moderate government of President Hassan Rouhani leading to the election of a conservative parliamentary majority on February 21 The percentage of Iranians who actively participated in this election was around 425 percent a nearly 20 percentagepoint decline from the previous legislative election in 2016 The low electoral turnout was a clearcut vote of no confidence on the part of the Iranian people in their system of government In addition to crippling US sanctions an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia which began on March 9 has gutted Irans already fragile economy further testing the frayed relationship between the Iranian people and their government And if this wasnt enough Irans first case of coronavirus was detected on February 19 By March 20 about 20000 Iranians were stricken with the disease more than 1400 of whom had died The Iranian health care system was being overwhelmed with patients with no end in sight There was no hint of regimechange tinged animosity in Secretary of State Mike Pompeos Nowruz address to the people of Iran in which he declared that We are saddened to learn of the mounting deaths this virus has caused particularly in Iran Pompeo closed by noting that To support the recovery from this especially difficult time our offer still stands to send humanitarian and medical assistance to the people of Iran Earlier this week Brian Hook the US Special Representative for Iranian Affairs in a statement to reporters provided a more accurate picture of Washingtons policy toward Iran Our policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues Hook noted US sanctions are not preventing aid from getting to Iran Responding to calls from China Russia and elsewhere for the US to provide some sanctions respite for humanitarian relief from the devastating impact of the corona pandemic in Iran Hook observed that the US had sent a diplomatic note to the Iranians offering assistance with coronavirus but that this note was quickly rejected But then Hook went on to blame Irans leadership for the coronavirus outbreak saying that Tehran spends billions on terrorism and foreign wars and adding that if it had spent onetenth of this money on a better health care system the Iranian people would have been much better off As bleak as the situation looks for the people of Iran there is reason to believe that the Islamic Republic may emerge from this crisis stronger than when it entered Foreign Minister Javad Zarif hinted at this in a tweet sent out in the aftermath of Brian Hooks press briefing The US administration gleefully takes pride in killing Iranian citizens on Nowruz Zarif wrote adding that the White House had taken its maximum pressure campaign to a new level of inhumanity with its utter contempt for human life Zarif concluded by noting that Your policy will live in infamy Iran wont break While the maximum pressure campaign has weakened the Iranian economy and eroded the confidence of the Iranian people in their government by denying Iran access to humanitarian aid at the same time it is subjecting Iran to some of the most stringent economic sanctions ever the US risks negating the impact of its policy by alienating an international community desirous of helping Iran recover from the coronavirus outbreak and similarly rallying the Iranian people in support of their embattled government If this were to occur it would be a fitting manifestation of the law of unintended consequences Think your friends would be

country Ken Livingstone former mayor of London and honorary president of the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign told Sputnik on Tuesday Venezuela is attempt to access some 5 billion was rebuffed by IMF officials on the grounds that there remained no clarity among its members on who constituted the legitimate presidential authority within Venezuela a statement that alludes to Venezuela is ongoing political standoff between elected President Nicholas Maduro and opposition figure Juan Guido Both the US and the EU recognized Guaido as interim president following his declaration while fellow IMF members such as Turkey Russia and China have voiced their support for the ongoing Maduro administration a point of divergence that has only grown as Venezuela slid further into economic and social turmoil over both political divisions and USimposed sanctions The IMF not approving the request for resources is putting ideology above the welfare of an entire people The US is undoubtedly behind this decision Livingstone said Following last January is power struggle in Venezuela Washington intensified pressure on the country by imposing new sanctions As of Tuesday the US government is believed to be considering offering some form of sanctions relief if Venezuela agrees to form a transitional government made up of representations from both the current administration and various opposition factions Given that the sanctions themselves have had a serious impact on Venezuela is ability to deal with emergencies such as COVID19 Livingstone noted that a report by the Washingtonbased Center for Economic Policy estimated that the sanctions have inflicted more than 40000 deaths from 20172018 Food and medicine imports continue to be delayed disrupted and canceled he added Inevitably this is affecting Venezuelas capacity to deal with the Covid19 pandemic but unlike Brazil say the government has taken swift action to contain its spread Combating the virus will put an enormous ongoing strain on the country so additional resources from the request to the IMF are still desirable he said The former mayor added that a number of members of the opposition including National Assembly Speaker Luis Parra recently urged Washington to lift the sanctions due to the coronavirus pandemic Following longstanding efforts to engage in dialogue with politicians of the rightwing opposition which has yielded positive results Maduro recently invited opposition leaders to discussions in the Apostolic Nuncio the Vaticans embassy in Caracas in order to try to reach consensus over the nations response to COVID19 These are constructive moves which put to shame the IMFs willingness to see more deaths in Venezuela rather than take a humanitarian position and offend us President Donald Trump who is busy putting corporate interests and his reelection chances above the health and lives of American citizens Livingstone stated In addition the IMF is refusal to grant a loan request from Venezuela to help offset the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a ripple of protests inside and outside the Latin American country with critics of the Fund having welcomed last week is statements from EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell supporting both Caracas and Tehran is requests for financial aid Josep Borrells statement that the EU is going to support Venezuelas request for IMF financial assistance is clearly welcome I say this not just because of his emphasis on the need to step up international cooperation and solidarity but because of his specific recognition that it is US sanctions that are placing Venezuela in a difficult situation by preventing it from selling its oil Livingstone said adding that EU support signifies a potential divergence within the IMF is membership According to the exmayor Borrell is statement also effectively acknowledges that only just over a third of the IMF membership recognizes Juan Guaido the failed coup leader and selfproclaimed president while the United Nations continues to recognize Nicolas Maduro as the elected leader of the country As a result this statement poses a muchneeded challenge to

government for its draconian COVID19 lockdown measures accusing him of putting even the most basic civil liberties guaranteed by the 1992 Chapultepec Peace Accords at risk and Washington is supporting it allA Continuing Constitutional Crisis El Salvador has just 261 cases of COVID19 and eight deaths so far but the governments lockdown has gone far beyond what the situation requires and at the same time has been neglectful of the problems created for people by that lockdown according to many human rights groups The Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador CISPES a grassroots solidarity group based in the large Salvadoran immigrant community in Washington DC published a damning report on Thursday blasting Bukeles creeping authoritarianism and militarization of the country and calling on San Salvador to rededicate money being used for the police toward the strippeddown health care budget A lot of measures hes been taking in response to the COVID19 crisis are following in this pattern of really trying to impose his rule on the country and really challenging the role of the Supreme Court and the legislators in any kind of decisionmaking processes within the country CISPES Program Director Samantha Pineda told Sputnik on Friday Pineda confirmed that Bukeles recent moves to balk at the Salvadoran constitution such as ignoring a Supreme Court ruling invalidating the police practice of arresting people who violate the lockdown and placing them in quarantine for unknown amounts of time were a continuation of the constitutional crisis that started in February Two months ago in order to compel lawmakers to approve a 109 million loan funding further police militarization Bukele sent armed soldiers into the legislative assembly telling legislators that its quite clear who has control of the situation His response to the crisis at the moment has been mostly to militarize the country even more than it already was and really implementing terror in the community Pineda said She noted that Bukeles actions are really undermining the 1992 Peace Accords which brought an end to 13 years of bloody civil war that killed at least 75000 Salvadorans For Bukele Human Rights Are On the Side of the Virus In addition to ignoring the legislature and Supreme Court Bukele has also attacked Human Rights Ombudsman José Apolonio Tobar who leads a watchdog office created following the peace accords retweeting a post from a fellow Salvadoran calling him such an idiot on Twitter and suggesting that he along with other human rights organizations are only working to get more humans to die Human Rights Watch noted in a report last week dozens of examples provided by the Ombudsmans Office of abuses both in the streets of El Salvador as well as in the quarantine centers including beatings arbitrary arrests and withholding information about the details of peoples cases Bukele has used the same position as a bludgeon against journalists and even the legislature Roberto Zapata an LGBTI activist and general secretary of the human rights group AMATE El Salvador told Sputnik Friday that the presidents actions were discrediting our work by saying that we are on the side of the virus and that we work for people to die To my knowledge this is the first time in our democracy era that a president takes this public stance with regards to human rights organizations This Zapata noted has put the integrity of human rights defenders at risk as well since their activities were not included in the list of permitted activities in Bukeles executive decree Thus there is no guarantee that activists will not be detained and sent to quarantine centers when mobilizing for humanitarian aid he said Likewise when the legislative assembly threatened to override Bukeles veto of a vital funding bill in support of medical workers on Thursday Bukele posted a tweet heavily suggesting the assembly had been contaminated by COVID19 and needed to be cleaned El EICEES pone a disposición de todos los diputados de la AsambleaSV pruebas de COVID19 Además pone a disposición del presidente de la Asamblea marioponcesv la desinfección inmediata del Palacio Legislativo antes de que se realice la plenaria de mañana Nayib Bukele nayibbukele April 24 2020 Both Zapata and Pineda pointed out the issues created by Bukele siphoning money from the countrys health care budget toward the police and military but noted the problem was still deeper The International Monetary Fund has extended El Salvador a 389 million loan to help fight COVID19 but it doesnt compensate for more than a decade of infrastructural neglect Although the current public health care system has many problems it is true that during the two governments of the leftwing umbrella party FMLN there were important efforts made to improve infrastructure accessibility and service quality Zapata said It is true as well that corruption may have prevented these efforts to have a better outcome However I think the main factor that hindered a more profound health care reform was the lack of enough public resources due to a neoliberal economic model that the FMLN was unable to dismantle in 10 years There are big economic groups that profit from this model and thus fight to preserve it Thats why during the last decade the most important cities in the country saw private hospitals and clinics developing much faster and steadily to offer services for medical tourism and rich people while many public hospitals and community clinics could not always provide all medicines to their patients Zapata noted In this COVID19 emergency one of the things I hope people will come to understand is that humans are vulnerable and that in order to face public health challenges we must invest a lot more in our public health care system Zapata told Sputnik This must be part of our agenda Femicide and AntiLGBTI Violence Spikes Another problem exacerbated by the crisis has been violence against women and LGBTI people In the report CISPES notes the Bukele administrations militarized approach has caused a spike in violence against these groups The Feminist Collective for Local Development has noted that the National Civil Police hasnt been responsive to complaints of gender violence which is especially grave considering the Attorney General has confirmed four feminicides since the shelterinplace order was issued CISPES wrote In a recent Instagram Live interview with famed hiphop artist Residente about the countrys response to COVID19 Bukele made several homophobic and transphobic remarks This prompted a denouncement from the LGBTI Federation of El Salvador demanding the president fulfill his duty to ensure the equal rights of all Salvadorans irrespective of his own personal religious beliefs Zapata noted that social media campaigns in support of vulnerable groups such as women LGBTI people and people with disabilities have attempted to hold politicians and public institutions accountable for the exclusion of these groups and Pineda noted that among the demands forwarded by CISPES has been the inclusion of the special needs of these communities in any and all programs instituted during the crisis However as one writer in El Faro put it earlier this week under Bukele LGBTI rights are paraphrasing Oscar Wilde the rights that dare not speak their name Nayib Really Does Care What the US Thinks However Pineda noted there was a role for Americans to play as well by pressuring the Trump administration which has encouraged the worst tendencies in Bukele toward a police state to back off from that support and denounce the police actions in El Salvador One of the things that we are also demanding is that all deportations from the US and Mexico to El Salvador stop Pineda told Sputnik El Salvador has continued to receive people who are being deported from the US even though all other flights have been landed So one thing we in the US can demand is making sure that the US is not deporting people especially those who we know might have COVID as well as calling US representatives as well as the US embassy to really denounce the authoritarian actions that the Bukele administration is engaging in Nayib really does care what the US thinks and does with regards to his policies and it has been very supportive of his militaristic approach so being able to have more congressional representatives denouncing him on Twitter does actually have an impact on how people view him in El Salvador and internationally Pineda said By Morgan Artyukhina

a troll ecosystem it is hard for the Kremlin to direct its activities Those dastardly Russians theye at it again using a global pandemic to spread disinformation conduct espionage and generally be allround bad eggs Except that the evidence of nefarious conspiracy is rather less compelling and actually seems to run counter to how the Russian government is trying to use the crisis Could it be that the Kremlin is not the villain this time The claims are familiar ones just put in the present context The European Union counterdisinformation task force claims that it has identified a coordinated plan o aggravate the public health crisis in western countries specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems Likewise Lea Gabrielle the former Fox News correspondent who now heads the US State Department Global Engagement Centre spoke of a idespread disinformation campaign that the Kremlin launched in late Januaryhat is ndangering global health by undermining the efforts of governments of health agencies and organizations that are in charge of disseminating accurate information about the virus such as the World Health Organisation The charm offensive OK let us set aside the WHO rather peculiar recent passion for bending over backwards to endorse Chinese statistics despite the numerous suggestions that they too represent a rather pernicious and dangerous act of disinformation Let us also set aside the possibility that the most dangerous font of virusrelated disinformation may well be the White House press room Even so it seems strange that the Kremlin itself would launch and push a disinformation campaign at the very time it is clearly launching a softpower charm offensive on the back of the pandemic The sight of military trucks emblazoned rom Russia With Loveeading to virusstricken Bergamo in Italy do not just play well on Russian TV but also represented a powerful symbol of traditional RussoItalian friendship whether or not the aid and medical team is as some claim 0 uselessn the circumstances Likewise a leviathan An124 transport aircraft landing in New York with aid represents not just a delicious otchaoment for Moscow it will be used as evidence that humanitarian concerns trump geopolitical rivalry whether or not the aid was actually aid or paid for After all the message that this is a time for all nations to work together is one the Kremlin appears to hope to use to undermine attempts to maintain the isolation of Russia in general the sanctions regime in particular At the virtual summit of G20 leaders last month Putin pointedly called for a oint moratoriumn all sanctions as a urely humanitarian issueree of any politicsf course letting Italian parmesan and Australian beef back in hardly balances free access to Western finance and technology That the point though it not that the Kremlin has changed its nature just its approach seeing an opportunity however slight to achieve something that is an absolute priority Of course this is cynical politics and largely symbolic but most politics is about symbols and much is cynical too Sending aid to Italy has been characterized as an attempt to undermine EU and NATO solidarity for example but although the aid Rome has since received from its allies has been vastly more extensive one might note that it took Moscow gambit really to force llieso come forward to help But if this is the current tactic why continue to poison the waters with disinformation The answer is probably that the Kremlin actually don want to ut can stop it Can stop the lying The political warfare that has been at the heart of Russian attempts to divide distract and demoralize the West is fought not by a single disciplined isinformation armyo much as a host of enthusiasts and mercenaries A isinformation ecosystemas been created of all kinds of shouty talkshow personalities toxic commentators ropy pseudoexperts hucksters conmen and online conspiracy theorists They essentially generate content reflecting their own leanings and lunacies their assumptions about what the Kremlin would like to see Having weaponized their imaginations the Kremlin gets to pick and choose which lines fit its needs of the moment and them magnify and reinforce them This is the crucial point while clearly it was the Kremlin that empowered this array of pontificators and paranoiacs its hand is really visible when we see crossplatform coordination When for example foreign ministry talking points start echoing conspiratorial blogs when funded foreign outlets start duplicating the Russian press when cyberattacks start harassing those espousing alternative views when lines from TV rants make it into Putin speeches That has been relatively absent over COVID19 There has been a certain amount of nonsense in the more hawkish or marginal Russian media but little effort to do anything with it The problem is that having created this ecosystem and maintaining the pretense that it is nothing to do with the government it is hard for its to direct let alone discontinue or defer its activities This is after all what they do it is their shtick their joy and often their job And this is a problem albeit one the Kremlin is unlikely to address It undermines efforts to reset the relationship with the West The claims of villainous Kremlin attempts to aggravate the crisis rest largely on unnuanced assumptions that the presence of disinformation demonstrates an active Kremlin campaign It also may reflect a habitual mistrust of Moscow nd also the institutional selfinterest of bodies whose very raison dêre is to find Russian propaganda Secondly it illustrates yet again the limits of the ower verticalrom the sight of the president trying to cajole regional governors into doing their jobs to the way propagandists are actually hindering official police the pandemic crisis is bringing this into sharp relief Finally most Russian disinformation about COVID19 is not just in Russian it stays in Russia The myths on the one hand about coverups of mass casualties and on the other of the magical virusbusting power of vodka or garlic or prayer These represent a genuine threat to the serious and sober efforts to educate the population about the threat and to ensure buyin for the public health campaigns at work In other words from geopolitics to good practice those who live by disinformation may alas die by disinformation too

reports from Ankara Turkey sent its proxy army into combat in Syrias Idlib province on Tuesday Photos available in open sources show joint actions by Turkish troops and militants from the Free Syrian Army now rebranded as the Syrian National Army SNA Izvestias sources in the Syrian government army say that SNA groups have moved into Idlib from the countrys north to help jihadists active in the region Many experts consider the socalled Free Syrian Army to be Turkeys proxy forces fighting in Syria and Libya They previously took part in Ankaras Operation Olive Branch and Operation Peace Spring against the Kurds And now they have been relocated to Idlib to fight Syrias government troops military expert Vladislav Shurygin told Izvestia Turkish proxies are better equipped than the Idlib Islamists the expert explained They have been provided not only with advanced weapons and equipment but also with M113 armored personnel carriers The militants wont be able to turn the tide unless the Turkish army joins the conflict The situation may change only if they secure artillery and air support like when they fought against the Kurds he added With tensions escalating between Russia and Turkey over the situation in Idlib the question arises if there will be another Astana meeting because half a year has passed since the last summit between Russia Turkey and Iran that took place in Ankara in September 2019 Head of the Political Research at the Center for Modern Turkish Studies Yuri Mavashev believes that it will be highly difficult to organize a meeting of the trio under the current circumstances However it is for resolving such issues that the Astana process was launched in January 2017 the expert pointed out Talks on the final status of the Turkish safe zone are the reason for the current rise in tensions in Idlib Timur Akhmetov an Ankarabased expert from the Russian International Affairs Council told Nezavisimaya Gazeta Since participants in the political dialogue are interested in stabilizing the situation there will be only a limited military confrontation he added XXX Izvestia Russian envoy castigates US visa policy as harmful for United Nations Washingtons unwillingness to issue visas to some members of delegations to the United Nations undermines important talks and damages the effectiveness of the UN Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with Izvestia He also pointed to the absence of official statements from the US about plans to withdraw from the Treaty on Open Skies and expressed concern about the prison conditions of Russian nationals jailed in the US According to the envoy there are a lot of rumors about the United States intention to leave the Treaty on Open Skies but there has been no official confirmation yet However we believe that the treatys participants need to discuss all issues and concerns at the meetings of the Open Skies Consultative Commission established within the treaty We still consider the Treaty on Open Skies to be an important tool for ensuring European security along with the 2011 Vienna Document on Confidence and SecurityBuilding Measures Antonov stressed When speaking about the visa issue he noted that the situation kept getting worse In the fall of 2019 many members of our official delegation to the plenary sessions of the UN General Assembly and its committees failed to receive visas he said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged Washington to resolve the visa problem because apart from Russians other delegations are also facing the consequences of this visa policy As a result it hampers the effectiveness of United Nations activities and undermines important negotiating processes the Russian ambassador emphasized He also highlighted concerns about the health and prison conditions of Konstantin Yaroshenko Viktor Bout and Roman Seleznev Russian nationals jailed in the United States We keep calling on Washington to consider the humanitarian aspect of the issue Meanwhile the US authorities havent contacted us with any requests concerning Americans jailed in Russia Antonov pointed out XXX Vedomosti Bidens presidential hopes hinge on New Hampshire primaries The New Hampshire primaries are the last chance for former US Vice President Joe Biden to win the presidential nomination after he came in fifth at the Iowa caucuses Vedomosti writes Boris Makarenko at the Center for Political Technologies President believes that much will depend on independent voters but it is more difficult to predict where their sympathies will lie In addition New Hampshire voters often cast ballots to spite Iowans and let another candidate win the expert added However this time all frontrunners except Biden can consider the Iowa results to be a success Besides New Hampshires neighboring state of Vermont is the state that Bernie Sanders represents in the Senate so his chances there look better Makarenko noted On top of this Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar has gotten a boost in support after her strong performance during Fridays debate the expert pointed out The moderate ones like her and they think that Bernie Sanders is too much of a leftist candidate to run in the final race so they are searching for a suitable centrist Biden used to be their favorite but he has performed poorly so far the expert explained If Biden manages to overcome this defeat he may be able to achieve more success in other states The number of AfricanAmerican voters is the lowest in Iowa and New Hampshire yet they support Biden the most the political scientist explained At the same time if the former vice president fails to regain his morale new opportunities will open up for exNYC Mayor and tycoon Michael Bloomberg who is hovering in third place in nationwide polls though he hasnt participated in the primaries yet When choosing their candidate the Democrats are mostly focused on his or her ability to defeat Trump Wise men say that a candidate needs to win over swing centrist voters though Trump did not bother to do so in 2016 and still clinched a victory Makarenko pointed out XXX Nezavisimaya Gazeta Philippine leader terminates troop agreement with US Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has officially terminated the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States In 180 days US troops will have to start pulling out of the country unless Washington comes to terms with Manila However even if US troops leave the Philippines it wont seriously affect the US position in Southeast Asia Nezavisimaya Gazeta notes Duterte started talking about plans to end the treaty a long time ago It seems that an incident involving this close ally Senator Ronald Dela Rosa whose US visa had been cancelled prompted the president to move from words to action Dela Rosa used to be the national police chief and the one who carried out the Duterteinitiated campaign against drug trafficking which killed thousands of people suspected of links to the drug mafia According to Dmitry Mosyakov who heads the Southeast Asia Department at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Oriental Studies the fact that Duterte took offense at the sanctions against his close ally is not the only reason behind the move The Philippine leader can surely see that US President Donald Trumps policies are aimed at reducing Americas military presence overseas The Philippines cannot accept it because the country is involved in a long lowintensity conflict with Islamists the expert said Mosyakov does not rule out that by terminating the treaty Duterte only seeks to make the United States increase assistance to the Philippines However even if it is true the Americans may not be willing to cooperate The Americans tend to rely less on their traditional allies in the region As for the Philippine bases they are not that important for the US at the right now as Singapore provides port access to US Navy ships and there also is a US base on the island of Guam This is enough to contain China the expert explained XXX Rossiyskaya Gazeta Coronavirus may harm Apple more than any other tech giant Chinas Foxconn factories that make gadgets for Apple are gradually restoring their operations as about ten percent of personnel are expected to return to work at Foxconns facilities in the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhengzhou However at the end of the week regional authorities plan to once again check out whether the necessary measures have been taken to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus which brought factories to a grinding halt Rossiyskaya Gazeta wrote The coronavirus outbreak made Apple and its biggest Chinese rival Xiaomi temporarily close their retail facilities in China Stores will reopen at the end of the week at best China is not only the largest manufacturer of Apple goods but also the worlds second largest consumer Meanwhile the demand for Apple devices has more than halved on the Chinese market HiTech Mailru chief Dmitry Ryabinin pointed out If the virus restrictions are extended it may significantly affect the companys quarterly revenues he added As of now only ten percent of personnel have returned to work which puts into question the quick release of a batch of 45 mln of AirPods Pro that Apple has placed high hopes on for this year Ryabinin noted Meanwhile Samsung can take advantage of the situation because the company has a wide network of production facilities and does not depend on China so much in terms of sales As for Apple the expert said that it would not face less but maybe more damage than Chinese tech giants due to its lack of stocks Often panic poses a bigger threat to the economy that the actual situation This is why it would be wrong to underestimate the consequences They will be significant for China and for all market participants Ryabinin emphasized TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews

be eased or waived entirely to help them tackle the spread of the coronavirus disease along with the economic consequences of the pandemic analysts statedLast week Russia China Iran Syria North Korea Cuba Nicaragua and Venezuela sent a letter to UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres with a request to call for lifting unilateral sanctions that are complicating the ability of some countries to cope with the raging pandemic Even though the eight countries refrained from naming any particular state responsible for the sanctions most of them are sanctioned by either the United States or the European Union or both The letter was sent after Guterres delivered a speech to the G20 leaders in which he urged them to waive sanctions to ensure that the nations affected have access to food and essential health services Since then the initiative to lift sanctions has been supported by other highranking UN officials Among them is UN General Assembly President Tijjani MuhammadBande who in an interview with Sputnik called for the cancellation of the sanctions that are negatively impacting developing countries during the pandemic Mark Sleboda international relations and security analyst in his comments said that the unilateral restrictions were seriously affecting the global fight against the coronavirus and hindering public access to basic needs There is no question that the US illegal sanctions should be lifted or at the very least eased during the COVID19 pandemic on humanitarian grounds The sanctions cripple several states ability to access medical supplies necessary to help protecting and treating their people as well as preventing access to international finance for loans necessary to gather resources food and ease the suffering of their people at this critical time Many will certainly die who could have been saved if the sanctions were not in place Sleboda said Thomas G Weiss a former UN official and the presidential professor of Political Science with the Graduate Center of The City University of New York also backed the UN calls to lift sanctions There are two sensible arguments to support the UN Secretary General First humanitarian values say help others regardless of their political orientation Second selfinterest dictates getting the virus under control everywhere there will be a recurrence in the late fall unless it is wiped out Weiss said Unilateral sanctions should not even exist without due consent from the UN Security Council UNSC according to Sleboda Economic sanctions are an extreme measure reserved under the international law and the UN Charter for the right of the UNSC as a whole to utilise only when necessary to preserve international peace and security Unilateral sanctions upon another member state without the remit of the UNSC are an act of aggression the capital crime of international law under the UN Charter The US makes itself a rogue state by its continual waging of economic war on other states in this way the expert said US at Fault for Unveiling New Sanctions Amid Pandemic Last week Washington added five organisations as well as 15 people to its sanctions over their alleged ties with Iran is Revolutionary Guards Corps despite several congressmen penning a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin asking them to suspend sanctions on Iran one of the countries most affected by COVID19 The administration of US President Donald Trump is exploiting the ongoing pandemic in order to put even more pressure on crisishit states such as Iran and Venezuela Sleboda said The Trump administration has made clear that it will not be moved to lift or ease its illegal sanctions on other states under humanitarian or international stability and security grounds Instead it views the pandemic as an opportunity to further damage and destabilise the states it has targeted for regime change It has indeed brazenly defying the international community and endangering us all imposed new sanctions on Iran and Venezuela since the pandemic crisis started The US is weaponising the COVID19 pandemic as an instrument to inflict economic and political damage the analyst said As for Venezuela the US on top of the existing measures against the Latin American country indicted last week Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and four associates for narcoterrorism Washington accused the Venezuelan leader of trafficking drugs and also announced a reward of 15 million for information leading to Maduros arrest The Venezuelan president has rejected the US accusations and said that Venezuela had been at the forefront of the fight against drug trafficking in the region The Russian Foreign Ministry has called the US sanctions when used during a pandemic an instrument of genocide

also bear in mind that Moscow was responding to a request from Rome Here is what happened The weekend before last Vladimir Putin called Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte During the conversation Conte asked for help according to the Kremlin readout which has not been contradicted by Italian officials Moscow sent teams of doctors protective gear and medical equipment to the stricken country The detail included 100 military virologists and epidemiologists along with eight medical teams according to Moscow news outlets Most importantly it delivered 600 ventilators Also on rtcomBig mistake Italy blasts European Commission chief says Europe needs great Marshall Plan to battle pandemic crisisA significant amount given Italy apparently had only about 5000 of the devices Indeed a few days after the PutinConte call the New York Times was writing about Italy is ventilator crisis The Italians got some practical assistance from the arrangement but officials in Rome were probably trying to use it twist a few arms in the European Union There is usually nothing like a bit of Russian influence to jolt EU and NATO elites into action No doubt this was also part of Conte is reasoning That said it is also worth mentioning that some other Europeans states have tried to help the Italians Germany and France in particular took patients and sent supplies despite dealing with outbreaks of their own Yet many in Italy feel they have not done enough Putin was also surely thinking ahead to a postcoronavirus crisis time when Italians will remember who stood by them in their hour of need Of course it might exercise a few minds the next time Brussels and Washington try to extend sanctions against Russia Indeed as the Diplomatic Editor of BBCs newsnight Mark Urban noted Russia and China have sent help to Italy You might argue its not huge in scale and given for political reasons But when Italians remember this crisis and wonder what the US did for them at this hour of need Russia and China have sent help to Italy You might argue its not huge in scale and given for political reasons But when Italians remember this crisis and wonder what the US did for them at this hour of need Mark Urban MarkUrban01 March 25 2020 Urban is a vocal Russia critic and hardly a Kremlin patsy A few days after the aid landed a campaign began on Twitter to discredit the Russian initiative The first I saw of it was a tweet from Oliver Carroll of Londons Independent newspaper who presumably speaks Italian I dont so I am relying on his translationSome Italians are expressing unease about Putin is Covid19 emergency aid he wrote According to La Stampa 80 percent of supplies are useless and sources worry about highranking military officers now in the country Russian soldiers are free to roam in Italy a few steps away from NATO the paper stated Some Italians are expressing unease about Putin is Covid19 emergency aid Acc to La Stampa 80pc of supplies useless sources worry about highranking military officers now in country Russian soldiers free to roam Italy a few steps away from NATO Oliver Carroll olliecarroll March 26 2020 La Stampa says China sent masks and ventilators but Russia sent irrelevant equipment used for bacteriological and chemical outbreaks Carroll added There is a belief that Russia is not helping us only for great goodness of its people now beginning to circulate in broad sectors military and political The newspaper is report seemingly relied on the testimony of an anonymous source who did not give their name Thus we have to take the author is word for it Also on rtcomItaly Covid19 death toll passes 10000 as 889 die from virus in one dayHowever the same day Italys Ambassador to Moscow had a rather different pointofview Pasquale Terracciano thanked Russia for its assistance in the fight against novel coronavirus adding that the humanitarian aid to his country included about 600 medical ventilators reported the TASS news agency It is very important that all this medical equipment includes 600 ventilators which are critically important at this stage of the epidemic The same day the President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana openly dismissed La Stampas report I say thanks to the Russians who sent us doctors and other people who can help with disinfection he told an online press conference Lombardy is the Italian region most affect by the Covid19 crisis The Russian Federation has sent face masks ventilators and medical staff and teams to disinfect public buildings and our cities Italian Foreign Minister Di Maio said They have helped in their own way in an act of solidarity Also on rtcomWe have many friends in the world Italian FM says no ulterior motive to Russian Covid19 aid calls it act of solidarityAs you can see those entitled to speak for Italy seem to be pretty grateful for Moscow is aid Nevertheless predictably Atlanticists were not happy Despite the fact that Trump is America has been about as useful to Europe in this emergency as a bicycle in the middle of the ocean The president of Lombardy Attilio Fontana also dismisses Lastampa is report I say thanks to the Russians who sent us doctors and other people who can help with disinfection he told an online press conference Bryan MacDonald 27khv March 26 2020 Eto Buziashvili of NATO is Atlantic Council adjunct wrote on Twitter that 80 of the Covid19 supplies supplies that Russia send to Italy are useless citing La Stampa Her Twitter biography by the way claims she is an expert in disinformation Next up was Olga Tokariuk who also writes for Atlantic Council as well as a Kievbased news site Hromadske which is bankrolled by the local US embassy According to La Stampa sources in the Italian military 80 of items they the Russians brought are useless she tweeted This was shared over 600 times Russian military trucks delivering aid to Italy in a massive PRspecial operation They are on their way to Bergamo from airbase near Rome According la LaStampa sources in the Italian military 80 of the items they brought are useless Pics by Ru journalist A Yemelyanova pictwittercomXf5iCkVC4q Olga Tokariuk olgatokariuk March 25 2020 Italy recently reported that 80 of Russian aid against Covid_19 is useless wrote Dionis Cenusa He also pens articles for you guessed it the Atlantic Council His intervention was retweeted by more than 400 accounts Also note that he says Italy recently reported not La Stampa Italy recently reported that 80 of Russian aid against Covid_19 is useless Now the Spanish authorities are informing that the tests sent by China are not working As I was suspecting autocracies show off with empty solutions and a lot of geopolitical PR Dionis Cenusa DionisCenusa March 26 2020 I decided to ask Cenusa a perfectly reasonable question Do you think Italy is an anonymous commenter to a single newspaper and that person assuming they even exist has more right to speak for Italy even though they will not even give their name than the ambassador to Moscow or the President of Lombardy Yes For real His reply was to block me Which speaks volumes for how the think tank disinformation racket works One of Atlantic Council is more high profile lobbyists Michael Weiss also joined in The fellow noted how 80 of Russian coronavirus aid to Italy is useless apparently What is most interesting here the fact that so many of the people pushing the disinformation are connected to the proNATO pressure group Not to mention the fact that they used almost the same form of words Was this coordination or coincidence Circling back to the original La Stampa piece it seemed logical to check whether the reporter had any the tank links himself Not surprisingly it turns out Jacopo Iacoboni has also written for the Atlantic Council He most notably assisted Alina Polyakova with a 2017 report dubbed The Kremlin is Trojan Horses This hit job smeared numerous Italian public figures such as politician is Beppe Grillo and Matteo Salvini as willingly doing Moscow is bidding Polyakova has since been appointed to run CEPA a lobby firm masquerading as a think tank which promotes NATO is role in Eastern Europe and is funded by American and British weapons manufacturers It turns out Iacoboni is antiRussia credentials are quite well known Indeed they have even been endorsed by the Intregity Initiative In case you have forgotten this was a British government funded undercover information wars effort which did not stay secret for very longThe Integrity Initiative included him in its list of people in particular countries its organizers felt they could use to run antiRussian coverage during elections This is not to imply Iacoboni knew he was he being considered by the British for such operations but it does mean they regarded him as reliably antiRussian Which tells its own tale Also on rtcomRussian military support much needed in Italy is critical battle against Covid19 Lombardy VPThe La Stampa story based on anonymous sources which may or may not be legitimate was a curious intervention at a time when Italy is on its knees The fact the think tank crowd most notably those from Atlantic Council who rarely show any interest in Italian affairs jumped on it is very instructive As is the author is own association with the proNATO institution Make of it what you will Like this story Share it with a friend

priority should be to carefully maintain equilibriumhough not equidistance etween the United States and China The longerterm consequences of the coronavirus will include the further intensification of USChinese rivalry and the emerging SinoAmerican bipolarity Russia top priority should be to carefully maintain equilibriumhough not equidistanceetween the United States and China For Moscow the global crisis provoked by the new coronavirus pandemic has provided a rare opportunity to try to reengage Washington This is consistent with a historical pattern in which Russia tries to use a common threat to reset its relationship with the United States and look for areas of cooperation based on mutual interests Traditionally the USRussian relationship has always been topheavy with the personal connection between the two countrieseaders playing a crucial role This time is no different Hardly anyone in the Russian leadership expects a fundamental turnaround in RussianAmerican relations in the foreseeable future The outlook is bleak the current confrontation between the two countries is labeled systemic and US sanctions on Russia are deemed to be eternal The MoscowWashington rivalry as asymmetric as it is is seen as linked to the power redistribution processes changing the world order and each country position and role within that order However tactical opportunities for even very limited engagement are not to be missed In a nutshell what Russia wants from the United States is to resume dialogue based on mutual interests and without preconditions Moscow US agenda is currently essentially limited to arms control issues Following former US president George W Bush termination of the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and Donald Trump withdrawal from the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces accord in 2019 the New START negotiated by Barack Obama is the last major agreement in place providing strategic arms control and inspections New START is however due to expire in February 2021 Russia wants it to be extended for another five years In 2018 when Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled a range of new advanced strategic weaponry he hoped that the impressive display would bring the United States to the negotiating table Mindful of the experience of the Cold War the Kremlin would much prefer to limit the USRussian arms race and preserve strategic stability than to engage in an unconstrained arms race Make no mistake though Putin considers Russia deterrence of the United States to be effective and is not turning to Washington as a supplicant Yet to this date no substantive dialogue has begun on extending New START and developing a new strategic arms deal In this respect the coronavirus outbreak has created an unexpected opportunity The American public attention is focused on China as the source of the pandemic President Trump for whom Beijing rather than Moscow has always been the main adversary is tempted to drive wedges between Russia and China At the same time Trump is also concerned by the plight of the US shale industry amid the steep drop in global demand for oil exacerbated by the SaudiRussian price war To deal with the problem Trump leaned hard on Riyadh and reached out to Moscow This caused a spike in direct toplevel contacts between the White House and the Kremlin Putin readily seized this overture On China Trump efforts will predictably be in vain Although the Russian establishment espouses a healthy realist view of China it would be ridiculous to expect it to alienate Beijing on Washington behalf On oil Russia cooperated with the United States and was rewarded by becoming part of the newly emerged global energy troika alongside the United States and Saudi Arabia Putin also had his own agenda of course He made a nod to humanitarian diplomacy by sending a planeload of medical supplies to the United States but most significantly sought to engage Trump in a conversation about arms control If New START is to be saved the US administration must work with the Kremlin on it right now It is hard to say however whether the Trump administration which is generally more hostile toward Russia than the president himself is prepared to do that work If the treaty expires without extension there will be no legal grounds for onsite inspections of nuclear arsenals and both sides will have to rely on their national technical means The prospects of postSTART nuclear arms talks that Moscow has also proposed are even more uncertain and largely depend on the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election If the winner is backed by a comfortable majority and accusations of Russian election interference are muted there might be a small chance for the dialogue to begin but even that will not occur immediately One thing is clear reaching newera arms agreements will be infinitely more difficult than before The ceasefire in Ukraine Donbass region should remain stable and allow for humanitarian and economic exchanges across the line of contact This is the most that can be done Ukraine never liked the 2015 Minsk agreement which stipulates amnesty for the separatists and near federallevel autonomy for Donbass Russia for its part will not abandon Donbass for a vague and most probably empty promise of an end to sanctions A solution to the frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine will likely remain out of reach for a long time The longerterm consequences of the coronavirus will significantly impact the global context of RussiaUS relations The most important factor will be the further intensification of USChinese rivalry and the emerging SinoAmerican bipolarity The United Statesngoing refocusing on itself at the expense of its global leadership together with the rise of nationalism in Europe will continue to transform transatlantic ties and the nature of the European Union In this environment Russia top priority should be to carefully maintain equilibrium hough not equidistance etween the

Moscow will have to draw a lesson from the spectacular fall in oil prices caused by the pandemiclinked economic recession and Russia illtimed price war with Saudi Arabia While the context of

held a video conference on Wednesday and with several countries already beginning to ease their COVID19 lockdown measures the blocs top diplomats also turned their attention to a range of global political issues including the ongoing conflicts in Libya and Afghanistan A number of the EUs member states appear to believe that they have passed the peak of their respective COVID19 outbreaks Austria and Slovakia have announced that small and mediumsized shops can reopen and students have begun returning to Denmark is schools Even Italy the epicenter of the outbreak in terms of mortality in Europe is planning to gradually begin lifting lockdown measures from May 4 Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell indicated that rather than the coronavirus disease pandemic several other issues took top priority during the foreign ministers meeting Although the coronavirus and its implications are still high on our agenda todays discussions are already an indication that we are gradually returning to the core foreign policy issues Borrell said While EU countries have spent all of April in lockdown and borders have shut across the continent the blocs foreign ministers appear to be looking to the future attempting to ascertain Brusselss next move in a range of global disputes GLOBAL CONFLICTS RAGE ON DESPITE COVID19 The conflicts in Libya and Afghanistan have raged on despite international attempts to reach peace agreements at the start of the year and issues created by the global COVID19 pandemic UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres has called for a global ceasefire amid the current health emergency and Borrell echoed these sentiments On Libya its sad to say that the situation does not improve neither international appeals nor the threat of the spread of coronavirus managed to stop the warring parties from fighting and the fighting continues its even increasing Borrell stated calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire Health authorities in Libya have confirmed 59 cases of the coronavirus disease since the start of the outbreak eight of which were reported in the previous 24 hours However international aid groups have warned that the fear of the outbreak spreading is forcing citizens to move closer to the frontlines and the escalation in violence is placing the country is medical workers in danger Borrells calls for a ceasefire in the North African country also reflected the potential for another wave of migration from Libya to the European Union On Monday Maltese Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo urged the EU to provide Libya with a humanitarian aid package worth 100 million euros 108 million which will also reduce the threat of an uptick in migration flows from Africa to Europe national media reported When asked for his response to this request by a reporter at the press conference Borrell appeared to be unaware of the details Despite the signing of a peace deal between the US and the Taliban on February 29 violent clashes continue in Afghanistan Borrell noted that while some positive steps have been made such as the exchange of prisoners Afghanistan remains no closer to reaching a lasting peace agreement We have been discussing about the situation where the country is in a political and military stalemate The peace process is not advancing fast enough he said calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the country Borrell was also asked by a reporter for his response to Washingtons decision this past week to block Irans request to the International Monetary Fund for a 5 billion emergency loan to help the country combat the COVID19 outbreak I regret that the United States is opposing the International Monetary Fund to take this decision I think that from the humanitarian point of view this request should have accepted he said Elsewhere the EUs foreign policy chief reaffirmed the blocs support for Greece and Cyprus amid a recent spat with Turkey over a maritime border deal signed with Libyas UNrecognized Government of National Accord that has seen Ankara bolster its hydrocarbon drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean The blocs foreign ministers also discussed attempts to reach a political settlement in Donbas Borrell stated that the situation in the region does not appear to have deteriorated due to the COVID19

Zelenskyys attempts to enact serious political reforms in the country Borrell stated The EU remains committed to reaching a political settlement through the implementation of the Minsk agreements and the work of the Normandy Four format Russia France Germany and Ukraine which last met in December he added SHIFTING PRIORITIES TOO EARLY IN THE OUTBREAK The focus on global issues at this stage of the coronavirus disease outbreak with many countries across the bloc still facing severe epidemiological and economic challenges may appear to be premature Before a video conference of the EU is ministers for European Affairs also on Wednesday Irelands representative Helen McEntee called on the EUs member states to continue to cooperate to forge a common recovery path as countries begin to start looking ahead as the COVID19 outbreak subsides No nation can successfully address the scale of the COVID19 crisis alone That is why Ireland remains appreciative for the solidarity and support which has been demonstrated by all EU Institutions and Member States the minister wrote in a press release During the press conference Borrells comments on EU solidarity amid the COVID19 outbreak were limited to discussions of the work done to repatriate over 500000 citizens who were stranded abroad during the crisis At the same time EU foreign ministers pledged to offer up to 20 billion euros 216 billion to fund a humanitarian air bridge that will deliver aid across the world to vulnerable countries Borrell initially voiced these proposals on April 3 with particular reference to Africa This humanitarian air bridge will be a visible expression of European solidarity and together with the commissioner in charge of crisis management we will explore ways to take this forward he said at Wednesdays press conference noting that France has offered to become the first country to participate in the initiative Funding coronavirus disease response measures across the world may appear premature when several EU member states have criticized the blocs handling of the crisis In particular Brussels was slow to react as COVID19 is case numbers and death toll soared in Italy Russia China and Cuba have all sent teams of doctors and medical supplies to assist Italy during the current epidemiological crisis and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was left to apologize in the European Parliament on April 16 for the EUs slow response to Italys needs Yes it is true that noone was really ready for this It is also true that too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning And yes for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology von der Leyen stated As the severity of the COVID19 outbreak appears to subside the EU does appear to be looking forward in order to mitigate the potential economic impacts of the lockdown measures that have shuttered businesses across the continent On Tuesday the European

help it combat the coronavirus pandemic Moldovan President Igor Dodon said in an exclusive interview with TASS First Deputy Director General Mikhail Gusman We should acknowledge that this pandemic has shown who is who who is a real friend and who will be always by our side in need even if they also face hard time Dodon said I will cite as an example Russia and China here because these were the first countries that responded to our request Switzerland was the first European country that immediately made a decision to help us The Moldovan president noted that Russia provided an An124 Ruslan cargo plane free of charge to deliver medicines and individual protection gear from China for which Chisinau was very grateful to the Russian leadership Amid this challenge and we understand that Russia is also facing a very difficult time they made a decision on granting a loan under an earlier reached agreement the Moldovan leader said So this pandemic will certainly turn the tide I will repeat we have seen who is who and who is ready to offer a helping hand in a difficult situation Easing restrictions in Moldova Moldova may within days ease the restrictions it introduced in the light of the coronavirus pandemic President Igor Dodon stated The odds are we will make a decision to lift some restrictions within days he said Our state of emergency is expiring in a week from now on May 15 Weve held consultations with government members Most likely we will not ask parliament to prolong the state of emergency The Moldovan leader explained that on April 27 Moldova canceled restrictions on trade in nonfood items and on services We will resume other activities in Moldova step by step Dodon vowed According to the president the Moldovan leadership provided a prompt and timely response to the emergence of infection in the country and took a number of restrictive measures as soon as the first case was identified on March 7 On March 1314 we closed schools and preschools On March 15 literally a week after the first case when just five or six patients were identified we introduced a state of emergency Dodon is certain that the Moldovan authorities measures to fight against the coronavirus have had their effect and made it far easier for the country to live through this period Even in contrast to many European Union countries although we have a very large diaspora in the EU we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the whole region he said adding that the coronavirusrelated diseases accounted for no more than 3 of deaths while Europes average is 7 In neighboring Romania the rate of mortality was 57 Coronavirus situation in Moldova Moldovas Health Minister Veroica Dumbraveanu told a news briefing on Tuesday that 115 new cases had been registered in the country over the past day to take the total number to 4363 with 1544 recoveries and 136 deaths A 60day state of emergency is in effect in Moldova The function of decisionmaking is in the hands of the National Board for Emergencies The country has suspended air links with all countries and closed ground borders Mass entertainment and religious events are outlawed School classes are suspended Postpandemic world The world will emerge completely different from the pandemic both from the economic and social standpoint as well as geopoliticswise the Moldovan president told TASS What will the world be like after all this I think it will be a completely different world including from the economic standpoint We see that the electronic commerce volumes in Moldova increased tens of times There will be a completely different situation in the social sphere as the priorities have shifted This is now medicines and everything related to fighting the pandemic the president said I think that the geopolitical situation will be different because as we could witness even within the European Union there were many cases when lots with medicines were snatched from each other borders were closed humanitarian cargo transport was forbidden to go in or out According to Dodon Moldova knows about it firsthand because this situation impacted the country In late March the goods that we have paid for were simply not allowed for transportation through some countries of the European Union he explained This is why the situation will be different from a geopolitical standpoint the president added On March 11 2020 the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic According to the latest statistics over 3700000 people have been infected worldwide and more than 258000 deaths have been reported In addition so far over 1200000 individuals have recovered from the illness across the globe RussiaMoldova dialogue A strategic dialogue between Russian and Moldova is no longer restricted to presidents over the last year it was extended to the level of the prime ministers and parliament speakers Moldovan President Igor Dodon told TASS He noted a significant improvement in the RussianMoldovan relations which has become particularly apparent over the last year We enjoy strategic partnership and strategic dialogue at the levels of presidents prime ministers and parliament speakers Something we did not have before You remember the situation before June 2019 when we effectively had dialogue only on the presidential level the Moldovan leader noted Russia and Moldova have a large number of joint events planned for this year Dodon stated In June 2019 the Moldovan socialists who support Dodon united with the Acum bloc against the Democratic Party led by oligarch Vladimir Plahotniuc who advocated a policy against Russia and towards closer relations with the EU the US and NATO The Democrats refused to become an opposition declared the new parliament and the new cabinet illegitimate and staged demonstrations of supporters who blocked state buildings After the new cabinet was backed by Russia the EU and the US Plahotniuc fled the country and announced that he leaves both the party and politics in general In Moldova criminal proceedings were initiated against him and the US included the oligarch in a sanctions list The coalition of the socialists and the Acum stayed for only five months in November last year the government of Maia Sandu was dismissed After that the socialists who voted in favor of Sandus dismissal formed a minority cabinet of technocrats under Ion Chicu with the support of the Democrats Dodon is plans for running for presidency Moldovan President Igor Dodon said in an exclusive interview with TASS First Deputy Director General Mikhail Gusman he could again run for president in the election scheduled for this autumn Dodon noted that the past three years and a half during his term in office had been challenging I think one of the major achievements is that we have got rid of the oligarch regime he said An important result is that we started carrying out a balanced foreign policy Even against the background of those deals signed with the European Union we managed to obtain an observer status in the Eurasian Economic Union According to the president Chisinau needs a consolidated Moldovan society that is still divided as well as more progress on the Transnistria settlement I believe that Moldova will be a generally stronger state if we solve this problem and if we unite Dodon emphasized For this its worth participating in the presidential election once again and winning in order to move forward in this direction The Moldovan president also recalled that the elections in the republic were scheduled between October 23 and November 23 We havent made an official decision on participating in the elections there is still time left he said Our main goal now is to deal with the pandemic and tackle the economic crisis Well decide closer to the elections

world have responded This has obviously resulted in varying outcomes Some nations have fared reasonably well Others less so And some such as Sweden have had a terrible time On May 14 it achieved the unenviable record of having the highest number of confirmed daily Covid19 deaths per capita reported over a sevenday rolling period Also on rtcom Swedish model of nolockdown response to Covid19 WORKED REGARDLESS OF EXCESSIVE DEATHS its architect says The chief epidemiologist at Swedens public health agency Anders Tegnell admitted that such a high death toll is horrifying a dramatic change of tack from earlier in the crisis when he claimed that the body count was perhaps not the most important part These results come remember from a country that was targeting herd immunity and according to its ambassador to the US Karin Ulrika Olofsdotter believed it could be reached sometime in May in Stockholm Besides the dramatic number of fatalities what is emerging in Sweden is a dreadful catalog of inappropriate healthcare provided for the elderly with sick and dying people denied resources which should be widely available It is worth noting that 90 percent of the total Covid19 deaths in the country are of people aged 70 and older and that half of these occurred in nursing homes There is for example one case under investigation by prosecutors of a care home in Stockholm where over a third of the elderly who lived there reportedly died after coronavirus ran amok In a piece titled The treatment of Swedens old and vulnerable is a catastrophe the Telegraph reports the story of a local Stockholm politician Bjorn Branngard who got a call from the nurse in charge of the care home where his mother was The nurse asked him if it was ok to move his mother to another section Why inquired Branngard Because its only her and one other person who is still alive Everyone else is dead she said Eventually his mother died too just a few days later said the report Also on rtcom Swedens flawed coronavirus battle plan hits the poor elderly resulting in worst death count among Nordic countries To their credit some health workers have been prepared to speak out on the shocking treatment given to the elderly As I reported in the Indicter registered Nurse Latifa Lofvenberg witnessed the demise of many patients living in care homes and told of how they were denied oxygen to aid their respiratory problems resulting in horrible deaths Her bravery in exposing this led to her being fired from her job after her comments were posted on YouTube Confirmation of this macabre practice was given by a respected professor of geriatric medicine Yngve Gustafson in an interview on TV Channel 4 He admitted What most often is done with the elderly at nursery homes after deciding not to take them to the hospital is that they prescribe palliatives usually including both morphine and midazolam This means that one quickly suffocates the patients because both drugs deteriorate breathing But its not only in care homes that discriminatory healthcare behavior against the elderly been observed It has also taken place in hospitals according to a growing number of reports filed with the Swedish Health and Social Care Inspectorate IVO These complaints surround patients denied treatment at intensive care units ICU at hospitals in the Stockholm Region despite places being available as they still are IVO has described the reports which also concern the Karolinska University in Solna as serious One complaint filed with IVO was also published in the newspaper Expressen It read We are concerned about the process of selection for respiratory care among patients with severe Covid19 infection in the Stockholm region We have repeatedly found that those patients who are deemed to be in need of respiratory care for a long time eg a couple of weeks are denied intensive care with the argument that a younger patient with better prognosis may need the place in a few days Also on rtcom So one Swedish academic quotes another Swedish academic on flaws of Sweden is Covid19 policy and thats RUSSIAN propaganda According to Dr Elda Sparrelid Stockholm Region chief physician there is no patient data linked to the cases claimed by the filing doctors Therefore it cannot be investigated whether someone received the wrong care or not she added The situation emerged after the National Board of Health and Welfare issued instructions described in an earlier article to handle priorities in case the ICUs reached disaster mode where resources would be depleted and no longer available to all But Swedish hospitals have not been in that critical situation and ICU beds have remained available ICU head at Karolinska Hospital Dr Bjorn Persson admitted on May 5 that only around 115 of the 140 available intensive care beds are currently occupied Nevertheless while Chief Doctor Persson denied that patients who had still had a chance of survival were not treated medical staff members gave a different account and IVO chief lawyer Linda Almqvist admitted it initiated an investigation Another problem has been that scores of elderly Swedes with Covid19 have had to wait to receive health care at hospitals or simply told to stay at home for an inappropriate length of time Some have even died without ever getting the opportunity to see a doctor Further evidence of the neglect of the elderly in Sweden is the apparent determination of the local authorities to manipulate or even cover up the extent of the scandal An exposure by a regional newspaper Ekuriren laid this bare In eight out of nine municipalities in Sormland south of Stockholm it alleged that authorities deliberately withheld the information in order to prevent media scrutiny and public transparency regarding the number of elderly Covid19 infected in care homes In summary the management of the pandemic by the Swedish public health authorities is not only an affront to scientific epidemiology but also compromises the medical ethics and human rights of a country that considers itself a humanitarian superpower It is just as well other countries have not followed suit Think your friends would be

Empire How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist He is the author of the book Midnight in the American Empire How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream Robert_Bridge As the Covid19 pandemic rages on Germany has shut its borders but asylum seekers are still being accepted even if they may have moved through the worstaffected countries Is that the right signal to a lockeddown populace The media paid much attention to an awkward moment earlier this month when German Chancellor Angela Merkel attempted to shake hands with her interior minister Horst Seehofer as the number of coronavirus cases was on the uptick The minister did the seemingly unthinkable and declined Merkels advances forcing the socialdistancing mantra on his superior An outburst of laughter defused any discomfort the moment may have caused Whether the scene was staged or not we may never know but it did succeed in driving home the unmistakable message keep your dirty paws to yourself and we may all get through this pandemic alive Despite the disappearance of handshaking however Covid19 has mushroomed across Germany This week the number of confirmed cases has been surging by over 4000 cases a day making the European Unions largest economy one of the hardesthit in terms of people infected By Thursdays count over 36000 Germans were infected and 198 had died from the mysterious illness Germany has imposed harsh travel restrictions essentially entering a bunker mentality amid creeping hysteria seizing the country Only German nationals or foreign citizens with an urgent reason to travel may cross the border Shockingly however refugees from the Middle East and Africa arriving at Germanys border in search of asylum are given the red carpet treatment into the country While it may be difficult to argue against providing humanitarian assistance to refugees under normal circumstances whats the point in imposing a transnational quarantine if youre going to let in a select category of people whose movements cant be tracked for infection safety To do so in the middle of a deadly global pandemic is a bit like puffing away on a cigarette at a gas station At the very least it makes for some very poor optics After all Germany is currently experiencing living conditions not witnessed since World War II Even in the capital Berlin panic buying has led to empty store shelves amidst a foreboding climate of helplessness and despair To compound the mounting frustration Germans a traditionally gregarious people famous for their Oktoberfest revelries have been ordered not to congregate in groups larger than two people although families have been spared from this harsh rule The average German may even have temporarily forgotten about his own plight when it was reported that Angela Merkel had been forced into quarantine after her doctor tested positive for the disease Meanwhile it cannot be ignored that the European Union is currently ground zero for new coronavirus outbreaks Nowhere is that more evident than in Italy which is currently under a mandatory nationwide quarantine with the death toll spilling over 8000 Germany is not immune to the emergency facing Italy nor is the rest of the European continent Just this week six Italians infected with Covid19 arrived in Germany for medical treatment with at least another 10 patients expected in the coming days Aside from the question as to whether Germanys medical facilities can handle the growing demand is an equally problematic issue should Germany be granting asylum to refugees who have not only entered the European Union illegally but have necessarily traveled through highinfection countries like Italy and Spain in their personal quest to receive asylum A critical point to remember is that if a refugee makes it to the German border that can mean only one thing that individual has more than likely broken the quarantine rules now being enforced across Italy and Spain the two primary points of entry for migrants making their way to Europe from the Middle East and Africa via the Mediterranean Sea In other words any refugee now standing on Germanys doorstep looking for asylum has traversed long distances through highinfection zones possibly even infecting people along the way Although German authorities have established quarantine rules for new arrivals not all of the refugees are keeping to their accommodations For example after one asylum seeker tested positive for coronavirus at the Suhl asylum center in the German state of Thuringia some 500 migrants from the facility began to riot after being placed into quarantine Around 200 police officers were called in to reestablish order Despite such measures it does seem possible for coronaviruscarrying refugees to infect people once they are granted admission to Germany After all no prevention method even a nationwide lockdown is absolutely foolproof mistakes can happen anywhere and at any time In any case optics at this sensitive moment are critical Now would seem to be the perfect opportunity for Germany to send an unmistakable message much like Greece is doing as it works to repel the hundreds of refugees gathered at its border with Turkey that the EUwide quarantine is for all people regardless of their situation not just fellow Europeans Germanys past decision to open its border to millions of illegal aliens from abroad was controversial enough leading to major setbacks for Merkels Christian Democrats To continue the practice now amid a global pandemic is at least politically reckless It seems inevitable that many people will come to view Germanys helping hand to refugees during a pandemic as simply too dangerous at a time when even handshakes among government officials are considered taboo Europe needs to cure itself before reembarking on the admirable cause

unpreparedness for the coronavirus pandemic says American peace activist Jan R Weinberg who cited the worrisome operations of the US IndoPacific Command in the South China Sea and the US heightened bellicose rhetoric against BeijingThe US is ramping up rhetoric against China following Donald Trump is claim that the People is Republic deliberately hid the extent of the COVID19 outbreak the American media has started to spin a story that the novel coronavirus originated in a virology laboratory in Wuhan Hubei Province China has vehemently denied these allegations stressing that there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that COVID19 was made in or leaked from a laboratory The US president has repeatedly underscored that COVID19 came from China calling it a Chinese Virus which according to The Hill had a detrimental side effect as it triggered xenophobia and racially charged incidents against Asian Americans The US has become the hardest hit country in the pandemic in terms of both confirmed COVID19 cases and coronavirusrelated deaths with over 700000 infected and more than 37000 deceased Why the Source of the Pandemic is Irrelevant The Trump administration has signalled that it is examining unverified reports that the highly contagious virus spread started in the Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV citing in particular two 2018 diplomatic cables warning about inadequate biosecurity at the lab However BBC is science editor Paul Rincon threw the assumption into question analysing both the cables and WIV is biosafety levels and recalling how the US military accidentally shipped live anthrax samples to nine labs across the country as well as a military base in South Korea The world still knows little about the sources of the pandemic but this is irrelevant says Jan R Weinberg an American peace activist and founder of Show Up America an independent organisation aimed at educating people and promoting civic engagement What is relevant the activist emphasises is that the US government has not prepared for contingencies and they do not think things through While Trump and his supporters are deflecting blame for the US coronavirus crisis towards China the pandemic is going to expose more and more how the US government failed to plan for contingencies according to Weinberg US Continues to Tease the Dragon in the South China Sea The only thing the US government through the succession of administrations and the succession of congresses have prepared for is war the peace activist remarks He drew attention to the fact that the US IndoPacific Command USINDOPACOM is continuing to flex its muscles in the disputed waters of the South China Sea regardless of the COVID19 pandemic When China was engulfed by the disease the USINDOPACOM conducted FONOP operations in the region near the Spratly Islands which China claims on 25 January On March 10 it did so near the Paracel Islands currently controlled by the People is Republic These operations have been repeatedly subjected to criticism by Beijing which sees them as a challenge to the country is sovereignty Daily I go to the USINDOPACOM is Twitter feed and look at the messages they are sending out and every day they are involved in military exercises in the South China Sea which is absolutely outrageous because those military exercises appear to be preparations for potential war with North Korea and China the activist says The 3 April incident involving a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel and a Vietnamese fishing boat which resulted in the sinking of the latter prompted a storm of criticism from the US State Department The White House pinned the blame on Beijing accusing it of asserting unlawful maritime claims and exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states amid the coronavirus outbreak The People is Republic refuted the accusations by saying that the Vietnamese boat entered the Chinaclaimed exclusive economic zone EEZ around the Paracels illegally refused to leave and then rammed the coast guard ship Since then the incident has been repeatedly cited by the US media which insists that Beijing has advanced the claims in the South China Sea under the smokescreen of the COVID19 pandemic Trump is Militarising the AsiaPacific Region in the Same Way Obama Did Weinberg stresses that this is not just Donald Trump Barack Obama was the same exact way with NATO expansion in Europe and Asia Pacific against Russia and China respectively The continuation of this trend is hardly surprising the peace activist underscores the US arms lobby is in a good position to influence the State Department and the US Congress given the number of exdefence contractor CEOs serving in various government institutions and advisory councils while former American officials at the same time are filling vacancies in the US military industrial complex On 16 April Mac Thornberry the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee came up with the initiative of creating an IndoPacific Deterrence Initiative IPDI and allocating 609 billion to counter China and bolster the military defences of the partner countries of the region in fiscal year 2021 The endeavour is a replica of the US multiyear European Deterrence Initiative which was kicked off in June 2014 to deter Moscow soon after Crimea is reunification with Russia Since 2014 the European Deterrence Initiative has consumed 22 billion in military training infrastructure and rotational deployments according to Foreign Policy Weinberg bemoans the fact that the US is sabreratting instead of instituting a plan where the militaries of China Russia and the US all three work together only for humanitarian aid and put a new plan together amid the COVID19 pandemic This is the time the things could change in the world and I believe these other nations are willing to do that but the US is absolutely belligerent he says This is a perfect time when humanity can come together but it appears as if no one in our Congress in the Senate or in the House of Representatives or in the executive branch is prepared to do that or at least say that it would make sense The views and opinions expressed in the article do not
