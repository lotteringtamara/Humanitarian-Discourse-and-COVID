2020 in Tehran Above Iran is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivering a speech on March 22 2020 in Tehran Short Url Since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal and the White House implemented its maximum pressure strategy Iran has experienced rapidly worsening socioeconomic conditions as well as multiple other crises The outbreak of the coronavirus adds another dimension to the situation facing Iran and has led to the country deteriorating rapidly over the last few weeks aggravating the misery of the Iranian people From a humanitarian perspective some Gulf states have offered aid to Iran But the virus has spread while Tehran is still dealing with unprecedented crises Facing popular discontent due to the deteriorating socioeconomic conditions late last year the government launched an intense crackdown leading to mass arrests and deaths And the coronavirus has cast a dark cloud over the country while the government is still struggling to deal with tightening US sanctions and the dent to its regional plans in the aftermath of the death of Qassem Soleimani One of the primary problems facing the government is that it is now in uncharted territory It is skilled in politicizing crises to divert public attention and maintain its rapidly eroding legitimacy but the coronavirus has left the government in deep trouble as it has struggled to provide an adequate response The regime is efforts to exploit the coronavirus crisis with its customary claims conspiracy theories and propaganda have fallen flat Indeed the coronavirus crisis has exposed the unprecedented depth of the regime is problems This being the case if the regime looks at the vast dimensions of its crisis or crises it will find no better opportunity than the present to reconsider its policies and behavior at home and overseas if it wishes to pull back from the brink of disaster It is illogical for the world to help Iran in overcoming the coronavirus crisis which poses a severe threat to the country while Tehran insists on continuing its hostile behavior and malign plans It is also irrational that countries close their borders to contain the coronavirus while Iran is regime continues to send its soldiers and proxies across the region to fight and spread sectarian hate and chaos under the guise of exporting the revolution The coronavirus crisis has exposed the unprecedented depth of the regime is problems Dr Mohammed AlSulami It should be emphasized that the whole world including Iran is Gulf neighbors wish to help the country For this reason Kuwait and the UAE consistent with the principles of cooperation and neighborliness that these countries are committed to upholding offered aid to help Iran in overcoming the coronavirus crisis Iran is regime should help itself too This period provides a golden opportunity for the leadership to rethink and remember that any policy or plan that does not have popular support is ultimately doomed to failure Similarly any scheme to export hostility to the outside world is also destined for failure The experience of the past 40 years proves that the Iranian regime has tightened the noose around the country is neck and placed its own people under the guillotine of blockade and isolation regressive steps that leave it lagging behind the rest of the world The killing of Soleimani had provided Iran with an excellent opportunity to reconsider its antagonistic behavior in the region Likewise the coronavirus crisis also offers Iran an opportunity to extend a hand of friendship to all its neighbors and to demonstrate that it has the goodwill and ability to cooperate with others The Iranian people would support the government in pursuing a more positive and cooperative policy with neighboring countries and such a policy could revive the government is legitimacy in the eyes of the public The regime is usual policy of resorting to manipulation and deception is no longer logical or acceptable under the current circumstances Many regional countries have collapsed due to Iranian interference leaving them unable to combat a threat like the coronavirus There is no doubt that the international community expects Iran to change its behavior and the global spread of the coronavirus provides an apt opportunity for it to end its isolation and forge relationships to counter this threat to humanity Contrary to the Iranian media is propaganda nobody in the world wants to topple the regime or objects to Iran is position as a normal state in the region Iran is leaders should view the world without wearing their narrow ideological spectacles that have created a mindset that is not aligned with reality The current policies pursued by Iran is leaders have failed to integrate the country into the region The Gulf states are keen to ensure that the Iranian people are able to overcome the current coronavirus crisis For this reason they have extended their hand to the Iranian regime despite all its excesses aggressive practices and antagonistic policies In return Iran is expected to show goodwill and to understand that the solution to its crisis lies in reestablishing positive relations with neighboring states on the basis of cooperation neighborliness mutual respect and ceasing hostility Any such change in behavior would serve the vital interests of the entire region and would be critical for Iran in particular especially given the extensive crises it faces at home and overseas with the coronavirus now threatening to further erode the legitimacy of the regime leading to its possible collapse if it is not managed well Dr Mohammed AlSulami is Head of the International Institute for Iranian Studies Rasanah Twitter mohalsulami Disclaimer Views expressed by writers in this section are their own and

important instructions on how to protect against the coronavirus as part of a campaign in the city of Qamishly northeast Syria GENEVA Since the start of the month an average of 80000 cases of COVID19 have been reported each day to the World Health Organization WHO the agency is chief told journalists listening in to his virtual press conference on Wednesday But these are not just numbers every single case is a mother a father a son a daughter a brother sister or friend said WHO is DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The global caseload for COVID19 has surpassed 35 million with nearly 250000 deaths Although numbers are declining in Western Europe WHO said more cases are being reported every day from Eastern Europe Africa Southeast Asia the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas However even within regions and within countries there are divergent trends the agency added The dilemma of rising caseloads While some countries are reporting an increase in COVID19 cases over time many have seen caseloads rise because they have ramped up testing WHO officials said in response to a journalist is question It is not good in terms of seeing cases in terms of transmission but I do not want to equate that with something being wrong said Dr Maria van Kerkhove of WHO is Emerging Diseases and Zoonoses Unit I want to equate that with countries are working very hard to increase their ability to find the virus to find people with the virus to have testing in place to identify who has COVID19 andputting into place what they need to do to care for those patients Her colleague Dr Michael Ryan added that it is difficult to determine whether the situation in any region is improving or not though countries with existing humanitarian crises are a concern such as Afghanistan Sudan Syria Yemen and Haiti We need to focus on ensuring that the most vulnerable people in the world get prioritized assistance in this response said Dr Ryan WHO is executive director Return to lockdown risk very real With more countries considering easing restrictions implemented to curb the spread of the new coronavirus WHO has again reminded authorities of the need to maintain vigilance The risk of returning to lockdown remains very real if countries do not manage the transition extremely carefully and in a phased approach Tedros warned He urged countries to consider the UN agency is six criteria for lifting stayathome measures That advice includes ensuring surveillance is strong cases are declining and transmission is controlled Health systems also must be able to detect isolate test and treat cases and to trace all contacts Additionally the risk of outbreak in settings such as health facilities and nursing homes needs to be minimized while schools workplaces and other public locations should have preventive measures in place Countries must also be able to manage any risk of the disease being imported into their territories and communities should be fully educated to adjust to what will be a new norm No going back to business as usual As countries press forward in the common fight against COVID19 Tedros said they should also lay the groundwork for resilient health systems globally The COVID19 pandemic will eventually recede but there can be no going back to business as usual he stated We cannot continue to rush to fund panic but let preparedness go by the wayside Tedros said the crisis has highlighted the importance of strong national health systems as the foundation of global health security not only against pandemics but also against the multitude of health threats that people across the world face every day If we learn anything from COVID19 it must be that investing in health now will save lives later he said While the world currently spends around 75 trillion on health annually WHO believes the best investments are in promoting health and preventing disease Said Tedros Prevention is not only better than cure it is cheaper and the smartest thing to do Contracttracing apps useful but inperson better Contact tracing remains a fundamental tool in controlling COVID19 but mobile apps for this task cannot take the place of public health staff Instead apps can supplement the work carried out by epidemiologists volunteers and others to identify people who have been in contact with someone who has had the disease What is important about the people that do this is that we need to find cases through personal interaction and through interviews all done physically distanced of course said Dr van Kerkhove The apps can help but they do not replace people who need to do that contact tracing Dr Ryan added that several countries and private sector consortiums have developed a variety of apps Some provide information on COVID19 so that people can check their symptoms to determine taking further action Meanwhile mobility tracking apps are helping to narrow down the number of contacts They are also being used for modeling and predicting the likely trajectory of the disease Obviously countries have to take very good care of the fact that tracking people is location needs to be done for the sole purpose of COVID19 response he said Dr Ryan added that WHO is working with developers across the world on apps that countries can adapt for their own use UN News Health staff from the Shaboura Health Center in

divided only by the fence between those who have set up their temporary homes in small dome tents in the deserted compound and those living in the middleclass residential area The lives of the former remain in a state of indefinite uncertainty awaiting permanent resettlement to a third country The pandemic has been making the situation worse as refugees have had to resort to their own means to isolate themselves and prevent the vulnerable group from contracting the disease The community decided to isolate itself after hearing on the news that there were 20 people infected with the disease in the Kalideres area at the beginning of the pandemic a refugee community spokesperson Hassan Ramazan told Arab News The main gate is locked and we only open the small gate that we take turns to guard to prevent people coming in as we isolate ourselves because of the coronavirus Ramazan said when Arab News visited the camp in May Refugees have been living in the camp since July 2019 Initially hundreds of refugees were taken to the temporary shelter but the Jakarta city administration ordered them to leave the building by August 2019 Some have left while others stayed behind 245 people from 28 families 40 children and single men such as Ramazan Most of them are Hazara people from Afghanistan along with a few Iraqis Four babies have been born during this time at the Kalideres camp Electricity and running water are scarce Even the street lights outside which provided some lighting to the parking lot were turned off in the evening Ramazan said Our lives depend on donations to keep the water and electricity running and assistance comes in occasionally and irregularly We could have water and food enough for certain days until the next donations come again he said There were days when donations came in the form of a prepaid electricity token so the people could have electricity for a certain time However when the token ran out and until another was donated they could be left with no electricity at all for days Ramazan said International agencies had visited the camp informing the inhabitants about social distancing guidelines at the beginning of the pandemic and sprayed disinfectants in the building But that is it They told us to wash our hands but they do not provide us with water They told us to stay home but where is home for us Ramazan said Other refugee

Since the beginning of the pandemic refugees in many parts of Indonesia have joined hands with the local communities and supporters to sew masks that are then distributed for free to vulnerable Indonesians and refugees that needed to protect themselves from the virus Maymann said Indonesia is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention therefore it is not obliged to take in the refugees who are now stranded in Indonesia as a transit country since countries that are party to the convention have reduced their refugee intake According to UNHCR data in Indonesia 556 departed in 2018 to be resettled in third countries Refugees are however allowed to stay in the country out of humanitarian concerns and due to the nonrefoulement principle that asylum seekers should not be returned to a

Fighters are highly vulnerable to the virus and social distancing and good hygiene may not be priorities for those engaged in lethal combat Syria has seen this A fragile cessation of hostilities in Idlib in the northwest has more or less held since the March 5 RussianTurkish ceasefire announcement Fear of the virus appears to a potent factor but not one that is likely to hold out for much longer The tensions are too high so deescalation is the best prospect In Yemen the Saudi Arabialed coalition announced and then extended a ceasefire Armed combatants in countries such as Colombia Cameroon and the Philippines are upholding ceasefires Elsewhere conflicts rage impinging on efforts to fight the virus in Afghanistan Mali Burkina Faso Libya and Ukraine among others At times the containment measures also exacerbate the impact of conflicts The closure of borders limits access in both directions Rich Libyans can no longer get to Tunisia or Egypt even for medical treatment In Ukraine many are at risk in internally displaced persons camps and among the country is elderly Crossings between governmentcontrolled areas and the Russianoccupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have practically ceased during the pandemic This has knockon consequences for family visits and access to vital services In Libya and Yemen the pandemic may be abused to advance the political interests of various parties by controlling the movement of people A nominal signup to a humanitarian pause did not really materialize in Libya Myanmar on Saturday announced a ceasefire until the end of August But there is an inevitable caveat It does not include northern Rakhine state and parts of Chin state Fighting is continuing with Rakhine separatists Vulnerable civilians will pay an unaffordable price for the failure of the UN Security Council to agree on a resolution backing a global ceasefire with the US blocking the latest effort last week Over a month of wrangling has yet to produce anything Such a resolution requires states to put aside and downplay some of their usual titfortat recriminations Thankfully the US has dropped its Chinabaiting insistence that COVID19 be described as the Wuhan virus but why could Washington and Beijing not agree on the relatively minor issue of whether to mention the World Health Organization A US State Department official blamed China as it had repeatedly blocked compromises that would have allowed the council to move forward Few believe this is just about the USChina tiff Would a ceasefire restrict what governments might see as bona fide counterterrorism efforts The White House clearly has concerns The United States supports the secretarygeneral is call for a global ceasefire but has noted that we will continue to fulfill our legitimate counterterrorism mission The US has no desire to tie its hands not least in tackling Daesh or responding to any Iranian provocations Russia does not want to be shackled in terms of its military operations in Syria Counterterrorism will be an excuse for all forms of state action some legitimate others really a cover The Syrian regime has couched all its military efforts since 2011 as part of a counterterrorism campaign even when bombing hospitals and schools Counterterrorism will be an excuse for all forms of state action some legitimate others really a cover Chris Doyle Would Israel feel constrained Tel Aviv has continued to take on Iran in Syria with Israeli defense sources briefing perhaps prematurely that Iran is backing out of Syria A ceasefire could allow Tehran some muchneeded breathing space Nonstate actors are not won over with grandiose speeches at the UN Firstly they will not participate in ceasefires if the major state actors do not fully commit Secondly extremist groups like Daesh are actively seeking to exploit the pandemic to spread violence A ceasefire is a pretty minimal aim It is not a solution A ceasefire without a political process is like a lockdown without a vaccine process The moment either ends the situation returns to status quo ante All in all it is a tragedy that a pandemic is needed to kickstart a push for these ceasefires and an even greater one that even this is not sufficient Chris Doyle is director of the Londonbased Council for ArabBritish Understanding Twitter Doylech Disclaimer Views expressed by writers in this section

month to stop flights to and from Iran in response to the difficult COVID19 situation It took the newly Hezbollahappointed Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab more than a month to stop flights to and from Iran in response to the difficult COVID19 situation Short Url It took the newly Hezbollahappointed Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab more than a month to stop flights to and from Iran in response to the difficult COVID19 situation Flights to and from Italy which experienced a spike in cases long after Iran were cancelled within a week But it was impossible to do the same with Tehran This is truly symbolic of the relationship between a vassal state and its master Even though after a major public outcry the government finally took the decision to stop flights one could ask who will stop Hezbollah fighters or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from arriving by land via Syria Who has the capacity to do so Unfortunately the Lebanese people are not only facing a threat to their health due to the Hezbollahcontrolled government The financial health of the state and even its future are also at high risk As expected Lebanon will default on its Eurobond debt and will probably also default on all its upcoming liabilities payments It is now clear to everyone that the entire banking system is in negative equity starting from Banque du Liban the central bank It would not be a surprise as banks might also default and go bankrupt to see a wave of consolidation and nationalization and tighter government control of the sector Lebanese bondholders are also set to see the value of their holdings go down or disappear Finally the haircut everyone has been talking about will look more like a crew cut than anything else Even if it starts with large account holders the size of the problem will mean everybody is affected Despite promises of change by the current government little should be expected As difficult as it is restructuring the debt is the easy part The hard part is restructuring government Indeed how can a state function properly while a militia acting as the army can choose what laws apply to its members and threaten those who do not serve its interests All three branches of power are under Hezbollah is thumb Executive legislative and judiciary The state is bleeding sovereign capital due to this corruption and mismanagement All indications point to the fact that it is heading for collapse and an inability to honor its commitments from the salaries of public officials to pension payments and other obligations This will cause more instability and plunge many into poverty and the country into high levels of insecurity As difficult as it is restructuring the debt is the easy part The hard part is restructuring government Khaled Abou Zahr What therefore can the best experts do if any restructuring of government institutions cannot go forward because it would conflict with Hezbollah is interests Can they change the electricity sector Can they impose border controls Can they even control construction permits Hezbollah which has systematically weakened the state will always put its own interests first Today the government cannot even exert its authority on illegal activities being conducted in plain sight it cannot even impose its control over the country is full territory So how can this government be capable of bringing change to the public sector which currently benefits many financially and politically As the situation worsens Iran has a plan for Lebanon Do not think otherwise It will not let go of its best foreign covert and diplomatic tool which is Hezbollah Now that full control is asserted the Iranian plan is a broader integration with Iraq which does not face the same international sanctions as Tehran It can also count on Syria for logistics yet Iraqi integration will be easier and can also help Iran Iran has stronger control in Iraq compared to Syria and can create new alliances starting from the energy sector which benefits its axis Incidentally when Hezbollah focused on taking control of Lebanon is Ministry of Public Health as the Iranianaffiliated parties also did in Iraq no one investigated the reason It is clearer now In this arrangement Lebanon will not get a full solution but just enough to keep limited government functioning to face domestic challenges while Hezbollah keeps calling the shots Lebanon will no longer honor any of its international commitments Hezbollah wants to keep this structure as it enables it to use the government as a shield for all of its activities Worse it is ready to change the regime and take full control of the state A regime of terror Oppression will be more visible in the coming months in any case The alternative solution which is the solution protesters want and Lebanon should aim for would require a complete overhaul of Lebanese politics and would start with Hezbollah giving up its military arsenal and control of government institutions This is of course wishful thinking Even the reforms required by the International Monetary Fund IMF that could bring some financial aid require more control over government activities starting from border control and this does not suit Hezbollah which initially refused this course of action Negotiations with the support of France might nevertheless take place to try and reduce the IMF is requirements in order to get at least part of the bailout If by some miracle this happens it is condemning Lebanon to even more hardship and will further sink it into debt that it will not be able to honor As the situation deteriorates and people suffer the true friends of Lebanon will certainly help but most probably through humanitarian channels and not through the government Shadow financial structures will be developed to support some businesses In short the Lebanese state will continue its disintegration Yet as the situation with COVID19 clears protests can force change It is not impossible Iran is weakened for many obvious reasons and Lebanon still has friends in the US and the Arab world They need to see a way forward as the Lebanese people do too It is time for a new leadership with a new vision Khaled Abou Zahr is CEO of Eurabia a media and tech company He is also the editor of AlWatan AlArabi Disclaimer Views expressed by writers in this section are their own

COVID19 patient in an intensive care unit at a hospital in Sanaa Yemen AP PhotoHani Mohammed File For months experts have warned of a potential nightmare scenario After overwhelming health systems in some of the worlds wealthiest regions the coronavirus gains a foothold in poor or wartorn countries illequipped to contain it and sweeps through the population Now some of those fears are being realized In southern Yemen health workers are leaving their posts en masse because of a lack of protective equipment and some hospitals are turning away patients struggling to breathe In Sudans warravaged Darfur region where there is little testing capacity a mysterious illness resembling COVID19 is spreading through camps for the internally displaced Cases are soaring in India and Pakistan together home to more than 15 billion people and where authorities say nationwide lockdowns are no longer an option because of high poverty In Latin America Brazil has a confirmed caseload and death count second only to the United States and its leader is unwilling to take steps to stem the spread of the virus Alarming escalations are unfolding in Peru Chile Ecuador and Panama even after they imposed early lockdowns The first reports of disarray are also emerging from hospitals in South Africa which has its continents most developed economy Sick patients are lying on beds in corridors as one hospital runs out of space At another an emergency morgue was needed to hold more than 700 bodies We are reaping the whirlwind now said Francois Venter a South African health expert at the University of Witswatersrand in Johannesburg Worldwide there are 10 million confirmed cases and over 500000 reported deaths according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University of government reports Experts say both those numbers are serious undercounts of the true toll of the pandemic due to limited testing and missed mild cases South Africa has more than a third of Africas confirmed cases of COVID19 It is ahead of other African countries in the pandemic timeline and approaching its peak If its facilities break under the strain it will be a grim forewarning because South Africas health system is reputed to be the continent is best Most poor countries took action early on Some like Uganda which already had a sophisticated detection system built up during its yearslong battle with viral hemorrhagic fever have thus far been arguably more successful than the US and other wealthy countries in battling coronavirus But since the beginning of the pandemic poor and conflictravaged countries have generally been at a major disadvantage and they remain so The global scramble for protective equipment sent prices soaring Testing kits have also been hard to come by Tracking and quarantining patients requires large numbers of health workers Its all a domino effect said Kate White head of emergencies for Doctors Without Borders Whenever you have countries that are economically not as well off as others then they will be adversely affected Global health experts say testing is key but months into the pandemic few developing countries can keep carrying out the tens of thousands of tests every week that are needed to detect and contain outbreaks The majority of the places that we work in are not able to have that level of testing capacity and thats the level that you need to be able to get things really under control White said South Africa leads Africa in testing but an initially promising program has now been overrun in Cape Town which alone has more reported cases than any other African country except Egypt Critical shortages of kits have forced city officials to abandon testing anyone for under 55 unless they have a serious health condition or are in a hospital Venter said a Cape Townlike surge could easily play out next in the big cities of Nigeria Congo Kenya and they do not have the health resources that we do Lockdowns are likely the most effective safeguard but they have exacted a heavy toll even on middleclass families in Europe and North America and are economically devastating in developing countries India is lockdown the world is largest caused countless migrant workers in major cities to lose their jobs overnight Fearing hunger thousands took to the highways by foot to return to their home villages and many were killed in traffic accidents or died from dehydration The government has since set up quarantine facilities and now provides special rail service to get people home safely but there are concerns the migration has already spread the virus to India is rural areas where the health infrastructure is even weaker Poverty has also accelerated the pandemic in Latin America where millions with informal jobs had to go out and keep working and then returned to crowded homes where they spread the virus to relatives Peru is strict threemonth lockdown failed to contain its outbreak and it now has the world is sixthhighest number of cases in a population of 32 million according to Johns Hopkins Intensive care units are nearly 88 occupied and the virus shows no sign of slowing Hospitals are on the verge of collapse said epidemiologist Ciro Maguiña a professor of medicine at Cayetano Heredia University in the capital Lima Aid groups have tried to help but they have faced their own struggles Doctors Without Borders says the price it pays for masks went up threefold at one point and is still higher than normal The group also faces obstacles in transporting medical supplies to remote areas as international and domestic flights have been drastically reduced And as wealthy donor countries struggle with their own outbreaks there are concerns they will cut back on humanitarian aid Mired in civil war for the past five years Yemen was already home to the worlds worst humanitarian crisis before the virus hit Now the Houthi insurgents are suppressing all information about an outbreak in the north and the health system in the governmentcontrolled south is collapsing Coronavirus has invaded our homes our cities our countryside said Dr Abdul Rahman alAzraqi an internal medicine specialist and former hospital director in the city of Taiz which is split between the rival forces He estimates that 90 of Yemeni patients die at home Our hospital doesnt have any doctors only a few nurses and

children from Bhasan Char Island to the camps in Cox is Bazar district more than two months after they were quarantined there amid the nationwide coronavirus disease COVID19 lockdown officials told Arab News on Sunday As of today there is no decision to relocate the Rohingya to the mainland refugee camps in Cox is Bazar The Rohingya are being taken care of by the Bangladesh Navy and everything is going well over there Shah Rejoan Hayat joint secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief MDMR said The Rohingya were rescued by the Bangladesh Navy on May 2 and sent to Bhasan Char after being stranded at sea for weeks following Malaysia is decision to deny them entry due to the COVID19 outbreak However the USbased Human Rights Watch HRW has urged Bangladesh to move the Rohingya from the floodprone island in the Bay of Bengal accusing officials of using the pandemic to detain refugees on Bhasan Char which it says is extremely vulnerable to monsoon storms Bangladesh authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to detain refugees on a spit of land in the middle of a churning monsoon sea while their families anxiously pray for their return HRW said in a statement released on Thursday It added that the Bangladeshi government was inexplicably delaying aid workers access to support the refugees with immediate care and refusing to reunite them with their families in the Cox is Bazar camps According to HRW the quarantined refugees do not have access to food clean drinking water or medical care while others have allegedly been beaten up and mistreated by the authorities the statement said However Bangladeshi authorities have rejected HRW is claims reasoning that the 308 refugees were sent to the island because authorities were afraid they might have contracted COVID19 These Rohingya were denied access by Malaysia Thailand and driven out from Myanmar Bangladesh was kind enough to accept them on humanitarian grounds So Bangladesh does not deserve any criticism in this regard it might be applicable for some other countries Mohammad Shamsuddoza additional refugee relief and repatriation commissioner told Arab News Hayat said HRW is concerns were unfounded because Bhasan Char an artificial island completed in 2006 had been constructed to be protective The Bangladesh Navy has a forward base over there and enough protective measures to ensure the safety of inhabitants on the island Hayat who is also the chief of the MDMR is refugee wing said He added that to safeguard Bhasan Char from tidal floods and natural disasters the navy had built a 13 kilometer long and 3 x 37 meter dam on the island which also has 120 cluster villages for nearly 100000 refugees Each Bhasan Char house has concrete rooms measuring 2 x 25 meters with small windows and a toilet for 11 people The current ratio in Cox is Bazar camps stands at 1 house to 22 people with around 15 million refugees living there Additional measures include 120 cyclone shelters that are constructed 4 feet above land with a fullfledged medical unit and enough food supplies available for the refugees on the island a source from the Bangladesh Navy is headquarters told Arab News requesting anonymity The lives of the inhabitants on the island are completely safe during any tidal floods and cyclone Around 200 of our members are stationed on the island including ten officers he added Meanwhile the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR said it was waiting for the government is approval for a visit to Bhasan Char to assess the immediate humanitarian situation and specific needs on the island Terms of reference have been shared with the government and we are continuing to await feedback Several months have passed since the refugees were transferred to Bhasan Char and it is now urgent for the UN to have access to them Louise Donovan UNHCR spokesperson at Cox is Bazar told Arab News on Sunday Donovan added that the impending monsoon season could pose a higher risk With the onset of monsoon and cyclone seasons the UNHCR is concerned for the safety of all people living in low lying coastal areas of India and Bangladesh including on islands such as Bhasan Char as well as those Rohingya refugees who may remain on boats at sea Donovan added Bangladesh has spent around 300 million to make the island habitable for 100000 Rohingya in a bid to decongest overcrowded camps in Cox is Bazar to accommodate refugees fleeing persecution Most fled from Myanmar is northern Rakhine State following a brutal military crackdown A plan to relocate the first batch of Rohingya was postponed last November after the UN raised questions about the safety measures and living conditions on the island Buddhistmajority Myanmar considers the

becoming a reality Incredibly it is now part of everyday life But sadly air travel is currently in a holding pattern The coronavirus disease COVID19 has aviation hanging on the ropes Airlines in the Middle East could lose 24 billion of passenger revenue and their passenger numbers are expected to fall by 51 percent this year according to the International Air Transport Association As the world comes to grips with the pandemics acute health and socioeconomic impacts we face a new reality of uncertainty Many of us are staying home wondering when we will return to our workplaces visit our loved ones and reunite with our friends especially for those 30 million expatriates in the region who are a flight away from home More than 90 percent of the worlds population currently live in countries with COVID19related travel restrictions Approximately 3 billion people reside in countries with borders completely closed to foreign visitors making passenger flights unsustainable to continue as they once did It is more than the feeling of an adrenaline rush while booking a flight that we miss it is what aviation contributes to everyday society and how special it is to each one of us Naturally as humans we are curious and explorers Aviation brings humanity closer together connects countries and unites cultures broadening our minds and experiences 50 years ago Airbus began engineering machines that took to the skies feeding into that human appetite for exploring new destinations and facilitating trade transporting vital goods and services around the world Just before COVID19 commercial aviation contributed 36 percent of global gross domestic product GDP and supported 24 million jobs and 130 billion in GDP in the Middle East alone At the crossroads of east and west the Middle East is at the heart of a pivotal air travel market In 2019 over 100 million passengers traveled through the region that hosts some of the worlds most renowned international airlines fostering important trade flows and exports manufacturing capabilities as part of the global aerospace supply chain When you take your next flight the person in your row could be traveling to a business conference to secure a new trade deal The family sat nearby could be travelling to discover a new destination In the cargo hold could be online shopping purchases or essential medical supplies and humanitarian aid destined to provide relief to people in need Through the turbulence caused by COVID19 aircraft continue to fly today serving nations around the world as the only transport capable of delivering essential timesensitive airfreight Additionally aviation leaves a vast ecosystem in its wake comprised of suppliers airlines airports and ancillary services worldwide that also stimulates the tourism and hospitality industries Collectively this ecosystem has successfully built what is today the safest way to travel Understandably after months of staying home and living under lockdown measures we anticipate an initial reluctance to travel and a heightened sense of awareness around hygiene for tomorrows air passenger People may question whether their tray tables are clean if it is safe to flick through the inflight magazine or if they are putting their health at risk by simply taking to the skies This is why it is more important than ever to keep consumer trust for our industry to soar once again to precrisis levels Throughout history the aviation industry places the health safety and security of its passengers and staff as its highest priority At Airbus this remains unchanged Through designing and engineering stateoftheart passenger aircraft we have made it a priority to safeguard every person who uses our products and services Whether flying in comfort onboard our aircraft taking the controls of an A380 or providing maintenance and repair services to fleets on the ground we apply robust endtoend layers of safety at every step With social distancing being enforced on the ground we expect a human behavioral shift in the skies Passengers have no reason to be nervous next time they step onboard Cabin air quality is meticulously controlled providing safe and ideal conditions The air inside an aircraft cabin is comparable to a sterile hospital environment Renewed air circulates in the cabin every 23 minutes through highly efficient HEPA filters that remove up to 9995 percent of microbes viral and bacterial particles from the air including COVID19 Moving forward we believe there needs to be a fundamental focus on sanitisation throughout the entire passenger journey Sanitary protection will become a key cornerstone of air travel alongside safety security and the environment to which we have all become

to spread to the rest of the world most of humanity has had no choice but to cope with the blows of a pandemic without a vaccine While the crisis has affected peoples lives cutting across political and geographical boundaries few groups have proved more vulnerable than the worlds large population of displaced and dispossessed living in conflict zones At the same time the wellbeing of billions of people hangs in the balance with unemployment rates projected to soar and potentially affect the lives of 16 billion informal economy workers worldwide The international community has seldom faced such a perfect storm of challenges in living memory The pandemic exacerbates so many of the worlds problems war racial and economic inequalities gender inequality poverty and more Kerry Anderson writer and political risk consultant told Arab News Several countries in the Middle East were already lagging behind in socioeconomic development due to conflict drought political unrest or environmental degradation With the advent of the pandemic however they had to quickly take on mankinds latest common enemy The novel coronavirus In response to the unfolding crisis UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres called for a worldwide ceasefire in March urging parties to lay down their weapons In an emotional appeal he warned It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives He pointed out that vulnerable groups such as women children people with disabilities the marginalized displaced and refugees typically pay the highest price during any conflict They were now at risk of suffering devastating losses due to the pandemic he said Guterres March 23 call got the UN Security Councils backing on July 1 when it passed a resolution that asked all armed groups to begin a humanitarian pause for at least 90 days to enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance and medical evacuations It also demanded a ceasefire at all conflicts it was discussing such as those in Syria Yemen and Libya Four months on did Guterress appeal make any difference to the lives of the people he had in mind To Anderson ceasefires are important tools but they must be followed up with action A preliminary ceasefire is an essential but temporary approach not a solution to a conflict she said A pandemicrelated truce would help buy time to mitigate the effects of the virus in some of the worlds most vulnerable places However both the pandemic and the causes and consequences of conflict are likely to outlast a ceasefire To develop longerlasting solutions such as definitive ceasefires the international community must use this moment to build a more cooperative approach to entrenched problems Anderson said In other words a pause in fighting only presents an opportunity to pursue more durable diplomatic solutions to a conflict Its a window of opportunity to provide humanitarian aid and an opportunity to try to both prepare for and mitigate the spread of coronavirus Anderson said Gueterress plea to silence the guns and raise the voices for peace resonated worldwide Eleven countries mired in protracted conflicts agreed to observe a ceasefire and 170 signatories endorsed the appeal by June On the face of it they supported the UN chiefs call to silence all guns and stand united against the worlds first pandemic in decades But as Guterres himself noted later the support for his ceasefire call was nominal in some countries and there was still a distance between declarations and deeds in many countries In some of the most volatile parts of the world namely the Middle East and North Africa the appeal of ceasefires proved fleeting Reports of airstrikes and clashes between rival sides poured in from Libya Iraq and Yemen while the healthcare situation deteriorated further in wartorn Syria In Yemen reeling from the worlds worst humanitarian crisis a twoweek ceasefire proposed by the Saudiled coalition backing the UNrecognized government went into effect on July 9 But just days after the agreement seven children and two women died in an incident that marked the start of a fresh round of titfortat attacks that have defied the UNs appeals for a ceasefire Laura Petrache a senior adviser to the Parisbased Migrant Integration Lab said Yemen is in urgent need of a pause in the fighting in view of the increasing coronavirus cases in the wartorn country She views a ceasefire as a perfect opportunity to end the conflict as well as contain the COVID19 outbreak Less than 50 percent of Yemens hospitals and clinics are operational and most lack qualified staff medicine and often electricity she told Arab News Another country where the UNs ceasefire call has failed to make a dent in the violence level is Libya On July 4 overnight strikes destroyed military equipment when they struck AlWaitya in Tripolis outskirts a base that had just fallen to Turkeybacked forces The attack took place even though both the Turkeyaligned Government of National Accord GNA and the rival eastbased Libyan National Army had publicly welcomed the UNs ceasefire call according to Petrache One place where a ceasefire appears to have largely held is in Syrias Idlib province even though the situation there remains fragile said Anderson Idlib has seen its first confirmed COVID 19 case in July raising serious concerns about the potential for the virus to spread through a region overcrowded with Syrians displaced by war she added The UN estimates that Syrias publichealth infrastructure devastated by war requires 10 billion in aid to combat the impact of conflict and the pandemic Further fighting would only exacerbate an already dire situation and undermine any efforts to address the pandemic Anderson said adding that it is vital that key border crossings are kept open for humanitarian aid to pass through For over a month now an eerie calm has prevailed in the Gaza Strip marking a sharp departure from the usual flareups in the besieged Palestinian territory There has been no official ceasefire but Israel and Palestine have put aside their disputes and made joint efforts to fight COVID19 said Petrache However attacks have been reported at checkpoints in the West Bank as tension remains high over the Israeli governments threat to annex parts of the occupied territory Despite the reduction in violence in parts of the world since the onset of the pandemic the condition of children in conflict situations continues to be a cause for concern The ceasefires during the pandemic if adhered to are predicted to protect 250 million children Theres going to be a generation of people who have suffered severe loss now known as human devastation syndrome due to the absolute refusal of combatants to uphold any recognized standards of behavior during war Kimberly Gleason associate professor at the American University of Sharjah told Arab News Unfortunately the conflicts in Libya Syria and Yemen involve a heavy flow of foreign fighters So although it looks as though COVID19 hasnt spread significantly there yet fighters coming from countries with known coronavirus epidemics can easily infect local populations Gleason also worries about the repercussions of the practice of targeting health facilities in war zones by combatants which the Middle East has witnessed in recent years Every additional day that these conflicts drag on and every healthcare worker who is lost to COVID19 or conflict is a tax on future economic recovery she said

city of Qom on March 16 2020 People gather outside the closed doors of the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Iran is holy city of Qom on March 16 2020 Short Url Iran is leadership is well skilled in adapting its rhetoric depending on its target audience For external audiences it uses diplomatic language full of concern about human rights and humanitarian issues Meanwhile domestically its rhetoric is largely reliant on conspiracy theories sorcery and superstition The latter is the focus of this article The contradiction between the leadership is various rhetorical styles and claims has become even more strikingly clear during the current coronavirus disease COVID19 crisis Instead of acknowledging and genuinely confronting the root causes of the spread of the virus across Iran and the resulting overspill into neighboring nations such as Iraq Syria Lebanon and the Gulf states the ruling elites in Iran have displayed contradictory positions On the one hand they have boasted that Iranian doctors are close to creating a vaccine and there is no need for external help while on the other they have requested foreign support and the lifting of US sanctions Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei typically cited a conspiracy theory accusing the US of creating COVID19 explicitly to target Iran He claimed that the virus is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they the US have obtained through different means Khamenei has also claimed that the human and supernatural antagonists of Iran have united to help each other accelerate the crisis in the country He asserted that the country is enemies had attempted to use demonic forces to infiltrate Iran is political system but had failed to do so Senior officials and clerics such as Hojatoleslam Valiollah Naghipourfar regularly make similar statements indicating that the theocratic elite adopts policies built on magic sorcery and conspiracy theories The fact is that the Iranian leadership is seemingly incapable of holding individuals accountable instead attributing any crisis in the country to wild conspiracy theories sorcery and evil spirits This rhetoric is deeprooted in the theocratic elite is worldview Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad irritated the religious elite when he amplified the idea of the Hidden Imam Mahdi is imminent return and cited it in most of his speeches His political loyalists produced a film in which Khamenei and Ahmadinejad were hailed as soldiers heralding the Mahdi is return Some clerics such as Naser Makarem Shirazi voiced opposition to the film at the time arguing that it dealt a blow to the Iranian people is beliefs and their faith in Mahdism In a recording of the former president purportedly in conversation with senior cleric Ayatollah Abdollah JavadiAmoli Ahmadinejad said that during a speech at the UN he sensed the presence of Imam Mahdi and felt as though an aura of divine light was surrounding him While this prompted many clerics to accuse Ahmadinejad of exploiting the Iranian people is beliefs for political gains rhetoric of this nature is not unusual Similarly a representative of Khamenei appointed to run the affairs of the Jamkaran Mosque in Qom claimed that he had personally witnessed secret meetings between the supreme leader and the Mahdi This startling claim did not surprise anyone in Iran with this rhetoric similar to that of Shah Ismail the 16th century Safavid leader who claimed to have met the Hidden Imam in a cave near Tabriz city and to have told him It is time to come out Go I have given you the authority The Iranian leadership seemingly attributes any crisis to wild conspiracy theories sorcery and evil spirits Dr Mohammed AlSulami Given the regularity of such rhetoric it seems that this is a hallmark of Shiite political factions attempting to coerce believers into greater loyalty through exploiting their religious devotion in order to enhance their legitimacy Bearing all this in mind it seems that loyalist clerics like Shirazi are utilizing the same cynical calculus in their approach to the coronavirus crisis For example they urged the public to visit sacred shrines and tombs in order to be divinely healed Ayatollah Mohammed Saeedi Khamenei is representative in Qom said We consider this sacred place as a haven for healing Accordingly this place should remain open The people should flock to it en masse Similarly a post on the website of the famous Fatima Masoumeh Shrine criticized the decision of the provincial council in Qom to suspend congregational prayers and sterilize the shrine is tomb falsely claiming that the structure of the shrine is antibacterial Due to this metaphysical and mythical rhetoric playing on the public is heartstrings exploiting their desperation and appealing to their religious devotion people took to the streets to protest the closure of the Fatima Masoumeh Shrine Some stormed the shrine while others professed their belief in its miraculous powers by licking it rather than listening to medical advice that such places are hotspots for the virus to spread All these facts lead us to the inescapable conclusion that by embracing such rhetoric the Iranian elite seeks to evade responsibility for the precarious political and economic realities its policies have caused and the obligations for which it is responsible while attempting to enhance its legitimacy and political standing through appeals to superstition and mythology At a time of multiple crises of which COVID19 is the latest Iran is theocratic elite is finding that its customary superstitionbased metaphysical excuses and conspiracy theories may not be enough to sedate the worries and anger of the longsuffering Iranian public While the religious elite attributes every failure to abstract causes and blames external factors regionally and internationally as always more and more Iranians are no longer gullible especially as the government is failure in dealing effectively

Griffiths the UNs Special Envoy in Yemen addresses the protracted peace process in the country and the enormous challenges that still need to be overcome The conflict between the government of Yemen and Ansar Allah as the Houthis are called has entered its sixth year and has had a devastating impact on the lives of Yemeni citizens The years of fighting have led to millions facing hunger and malnutrition created the worlds worst humanitarian crisis There have been hundreds of reported civilian deaths and human rights abuses Griffiths leads the UNs efforts on behalf of SecretaryGeneral António Guterres to broker a negotiated settlement to comprehensively end the war And although the warring sides are engaged in the mediation process his attempts to bring about a sorelyneeded ceasefire and much needed humanitarian and economic measures have become even more urgent as the global health and economic crisis brought about by the COVID19 pandemic threatens to worsen conditions for civilians caught up in the conflict Griffiths began the interview conducted over email with an update on the progress of peace negotiations The process started in March when the UN Secretary General called on those fighting in Yemen to cease hostilities and focus on combating the threat of COVID19 and to use this opportunity to reach a political solution The government of Yemen and Ansar Allah as well as other Yemeni parties and civil society welcomed the SecretaryGenerals calls At the end of March my office shared with the government of Yemen and Ansar Allah proposed draft agreements on a nationwide ceasefire humanitarian and economic measures and the urgent resumption of the political process aimed at comprehensively ending the conflict I will not give up on the pursuit of an end to the fighting measures to alleviate the suffering of the people and the resumption of peaceful dialogue By early April we had received initial feedback from both parties After considering the positions of both parties we shared with them a revised draft in midApril to bridge their views Several rounds of bilateral negotiations with both parties have followed in the months since April The process is ongoing to this day and the text continues to be subject to substantive changes as long as it remains under negotiation The process has been long and challenging especially as it is being conducted mainly in the virtual world It is very difficult to negotiate such a sensitive agreement against the backdrop of the eroding trust between the parties especially with the continued military hostilities on all fronts It is my responsibility as a mediator to bridge the divide between the parties positions no matter how wide until a mutually accepted compromise is reached that meets the aspirations of the Yemeni people I will not give up on the pursuit of an end to the fighting measures to alleviate the suffering of the people and the resumption of peaceful dialogue aimed at ending the conflict As long as the Parties remain engaged in the process there is a chance for peace in Yemen How would the Joint Declaration help bring peace and prosperity to Yemen The Joint Declaration is not in and of itself an end to the conflict However it would be an important step toward achieving an immediate nationwide ceasefire in Yemen easing the suffering of Yemenis and paving the way to peace talks aimed at comprehensively ending the conflict The ceasefire element of the Joint Declaration is long overdue Since January we have seen a renewed wave of military escalation in different parts of the country Just two days ago seven children and two women were killed following an airstrike in Hajjah Yemenis are forced to deal with the dire consequences of this raging war while also struggling with a crumbling economy and a devastating outbreak of Coronavirus The humanitarian and economic measures included in the Joint Declaration are also long overdue The Declaration provides commitments and outlines steps for among other measures the creation of a joint operations unit between the government of Yemen and Ansar Allah with the support of the World Health Organization to ensure the delivery of an effective and coordinated response to the COVID19 outbreak across Yemen the payment of the salaries of the civil servants who are on the 2014 payroll database and have not been receiving their salaries In addition other measures include the release of all conflictrelated prisoners and detainees a move that has become even more urgent with the spread of COVID19 and other diseases in Yemen opening main essential access roads in and between governorates opening Sanaa airport and easing the restrictions on the entry of commercial container ships as well as of ships carrying gas and oil through Hodeidah ports while ensuring compliance with the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council and securing the safety of the Safer tanker which has been stuck in Ras Issa for the past five years threatening to cause a massive oil spill an environmental catastrophe for Yemen and its neighbors The Declaration commits the parties to urgently resume peace talks based on the three references which is the only way to break with the violence of the past My office continues to work intensively on some of these measures independently of the ongoing negotiations including the Safer issue because they truly are urgently needed If the parties agree to address these humanitarian needs it will not only ease the suffering of Yemenis everywhere but will also mark a significant milestone towards restoring trust between the parties Finally and perhaps most importantly the Declaration commits the parties to urgently resume peace talks based on the three references which is the only way to break with the violence of the past and end this conflict comprehensively and sustainably Without a political horizon and progress on the political track the ceasefire and any measures agreed in the Joint Declaration will inevitably end up falling apart We have seen it before in Yemen and we must not allow it to happen again There are always points of convergence that a mediation process can build on Yemen is no different We will continue to work with the parties to find a consensual path forward to achieve these mutual goals and pave the way for bringing this conflict to a sustainable end The United Nations considers inclusivity to be a core principle of peacebuilding How are you engaging the various stakeholders and different groups of the Yemeni society including women and Youth The virtual modus operandi that COVID19 has obliged us to follow allowed us to explore new tools of inclusion that have been eyeopening in many respects Since the beginning of the lockdown in midMarch we launched a digital inclusion plan aimed at regularly briefing diverse Yemeni groups about the progress of the negotiation with as much transparency as possible without jeopardizing the confidentiality required to ensure the success of this mediation process These groups and individuals included women Yemeni and international organizations media professionals and young individual civil society actors We consulted these people on the terms of the Joint Declaration and discussed with them ways to make its implementation as inclusive as possible One of these meetings for example was a brainstorm with Yemeni women about gender considerations in ceasefire implementation We also organized a twoday largescale virtual interactive consultation with over 650 Yemenis mostly from civil society Over a third of the participants were women and nearly a half were youth This was the first time something like this has been done during an active mediation process I am personally very grateful for the continued engagement of so many Yemenis and I am humbled by their inspiring courageous and tireless advocacy for a peaceful future Most of the people we have spoken to the overwhelming majority believe it is necessary and urgent to immediately begin a nationwide ceasefire They believe the resumption of the peace process is essential and long overdue They mostly agree on the importance and urgency of all the humanitarian measures included in the Joint Declaration We also heard their concerns about the need for guarantees to ensure a democratic future based on principles of human rights accountable governance and equal citizenship And we heard very clearly their frustration with the lack of progress toward ending the conflict while Yemenis continue to suffer We share this frustration These fears and concerns are at the heart of our planning for the future I am personally very grateful for the continued engagement of so many Yemenis and I am humbled by their inspiring courageous and tireless advocacy for a peaceful future for their country We are pursuing further expansion of our digital outreach activities as well as offline outreach options to reach local communities who do not enjoy the same access to the Internet We are further planning to expand our Yemeni networks of peace advocates to push the peace agenda forward now during the political process and during the transition One of the components of this declaration is ceasefire We have seen military escalation lately including the recent hostilities in Marib and Al Jawf governorates This is also true for the southern part of the country I am sure you are you communicating with the involved parties on this front What does the continued fighting mean for the ongoing negotiations The continued military escalation makes everything more difficult It comes at a very heavy price for civilians on all sides It intensifies the challenge of responding effectively to the outbreak of COVID19 and exacerbates the humanitarian suffering of a population that has already been through too much in the past five years I am disheartened that even while our negotiations are progressing we continue to see the fervent quest for additional territorial gain on full display And it is unfortunate that the fighting has not stopped or slowed down even with the outbreak of the pandemic It is not too late to reverse course and get back on a track of peaceful politics and negotiations instead of the quest to resolve the conflict through military force But let me be clear about two things First the continued assault on Marib is unacceptable I am afraid this assault could seriously undermine the prospects of peace in Yemen Second it is not too late to reverse course and get back on a track of peaceful politics and negotiations instead of the quest to resolve the conflict through military force The parties constantly say they are committed to stop fighting as soon as a ceasefire agreement is reached I expect from the parties to act in good faith in line with their initial commitment to negotiate the ceasefire agreement and to restrain themselves from pursuing active military operations during the negotiations Thousands of Yemeni civil servants have not received their salaries for years This has caused prolonged suffering in Yemen that is becoming even more acute now with the added economic pressure caused by the coronavirus outbreak Reports also suggest there is an escalating fuel shortage crisis in the north The Stockholm Agreement stipulated that ships carrying fuel and oil derivatives will be allowed through Yemens largest ports in Hodeidah and that the revenues from the port would be used for the payment of civil servants salaries How do you evaluate the progress on the implementation of this provision Last year my office mediated between the parties a set of temporary arrangements to support them in fulfilling the commitment they made in Stockholm to channel revenues collected from the Hodeidah port to the Central Bank of Yemen through its branch in Hodeidah CBY Hodeidah as a contribution to the payment of civil servant salaries in Hodeidah and across Yemen Under the terms of these temporary arrangements the parties agreed that customs taxes and other revenues from ships carrying fuel and oil derivatives into the Hodeidah port would be deposited in a Special Account in CBY Hodeidah and eventually disbursed in accordance with an agreed mechanism for civil servant salaries Unfortunately these arrangements are currently suspended following the unilateral withdrawal of funds accumulated in that account by Ansar Allah Houthis earlier this year I have since asked Ansar Allah for a series of corrective measures including by providing my office with documentation on the use of the funds The suspension of the temporary arrangements meant that ships carrying fuel and oil derivatives could no longer enter through the Hodeidah port Following my recent visit to Riyadh the government of Yemen exceptionally provided clearances for four ships for humanitarian reasons and indicated their willingness to engage with my office on finding a sustainable solution for the problem I very much welcome this step But it will only provide temporary relief Our vision and hope for the future of Yemen is to reach a point when Yemenis have the tools to take charge of their own future based on the principles of democracy human rights accountable governance and equal citizenship My office is working urgently with the parties to try to find a mutually agreed way forward The revenues of the Hodeidah port should be used for the benefit of Yemenis as a contribution to the payment of civil servant salaries At this critical time Yemenis must also continue to have smooth regular and uninterrupted access to fuel Scarcity or shortage in the supply of fuel will have dire humanitarian consequences on Yemenis everyday life and on the healthcare sector What is the United Nations vision for the future of Yemen Our vision and hope for the future of Yemen is to reach a point when Yemenis have the tools to take charge of their own future based on the principles of democracy human rights accountable governance and equal citizenship We aspire for a transitional period that would usher in a political future marked with powersharing in the spirit of consensus and partnership where peaceful dialogue replaces violence and when all political and social components of the Yemeni society accept each other and work together for the common good of the country It might seem like a distant dream now The pervasiveness of human rights abuses intolerance and exclusion have escalated dramatically since the beginning of the conflict There has been a great deal of damage to the basic foundations of a healthy political life including by gravely weakening state institutions and public trust in them This is in addition to the erosion of the freedom and independence of the media and the civil society There has also been a worrying trend of targeting political opponents and media professionals and an intensification of the discourse of violence hatred and sectarianism This is unacceptable However I am very encouraged and inspired by the diligent work of human rights and civil society actors in Yemen I am also always reminded of the great example Yemen has set in the National Dialogue Conference the outcome of which remains a reference in the UNfacilitated political process An inclusive peaceful transition would allow the renewal of dialogue will once again foster tolerance and acceptance and will address the grievances of the past with an eye on the future UN News Caps

it is usually to exchange insults accusations threats or even physical attacks in attempts to inflict maximum mutual harm It therefore came as somewhat of a surprise when the two sides struck a more conciliatory tone of readiness to engage in prisoner exchange and provide humanitarian assistance to the stricken Gaza Strip Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a call through his office at the beginning of the month for the immediate resumption of talks through international mediators to conclude a prisoner swap with Hamas hopeful of recovering its war dead and missing soldiers and thus conclude this tragic saga It is not often that the interests of Israel and Hamas align so closely but at the moment both sides seem keen to at least negotiate motivated partly by a period of quiet along their border but even more so by the havoc threatened by the coronavirus In the coincidental intersection between the pandemic and both sides commitment to their people in captivity lies an opportunity to strike a deal that would include an exchange of prisoners and the supply of humanitarian aid to Gaza which is an Israeli interest as much as a Palestinian one Rumours about an exchange of prisoners have circulated regularly over the years Hamas possesses the remains of Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul Israeli soldiers killed in Operation Protective Edge in 2014 and has held captive or at least knows the fate of Avera Mengistu and Hisham AlSayed Israeli citizens who crossed into Gaza of their own volition and are believed to be alive But the pandemic has provided an incentive to advance negotiations that have been on the back burner In the unorthodox style of communication between the two what might appear as readiness for a deal was prompted by a provocative statement at the beginning of the month by Hamass leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar who warned Israel that if more ventilators for coronavirus patients were not supplied to the besieged Palestinian enclave then Hamas would take them by force from Israel and stop the breathing of 6 million Israelis However in the same breath Sinwar himself one of more than 1000 Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel in 2011 as part of a deal to release Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit declared that Hamas was ready to make partial concessions on our prisoners issue in exchange for Israels release of elderly prisoners patients and prisoners as a humanitarian gesture in light of the coronavirus crisis Israels decision makers took both the threat and the opening for negotiations seriously Sinwars message was an undoubtedly genuine expression of concern not only for the wellbeing of Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails but also that the more vulnerable of them coming to harm without his government doing enough to release them could bring political repercussions for the Hamas leadership from their own countrymen Hamas is also aware of Israels sensitivity over the return of its captive citizens and especially the remains of the two fallen soldiers It is a long tradition embedded in the ethos of Israeli society to spare no effort to secure the release of its prisoners of war or those taken hostage this is to a certain extent a sign of strength but also exposes its vulnerability in negotiating which usually increases the price of bringing them back It is not often that the interests of Israel and Hamas align so closely but at the moment both sides seem keen to at least negotiate motivitated by a period of quiet even more so by the havoc threatened by the coronavirus Yossi Mekelberg In this case however it is not only the return of its citizens and fallen soldiers that is in Israels interest It also wants to avoid the death of Hamas prisoners which could ignite unrest among other Palestinian prisoners and also those in the Gaza Strip Similarly avoiding a pandemic catastrophe in Gaza with its high population density lack of sanitation and hygiene and crippled health system is a vital Israeli concern And the proximity of Gaza means that an uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus there would affect Israel not only healthwise but politically too After 13 years of a punitive blockade that has left the health and wellbeing of this small enclave in a fragile state while the responsibility would not lie solely with Israel it must shoulder much of it Some in Israel argue against the high price of releasing 250 Hamas prisoners some with blood on their hands as demanded by Hamas Much of this criticism derives from past experience of released prisoners returning to militancy and killing innocent people However whatever the rights and wrongs of past prisoner exchange deals the current situation is different There is an opportunity presented by the tragic circumstances of a pandemic for these two sworn enemies not only to show some humanity but also to demonstrate some political astuteness in averting a humanitarian disaster for which both sides would be held responsible It is rare that a winwin situation presents itself to Israel and Hamas in which the benefits for both outweigh the costs Equally important a deal that may save many lives and bring loved ones back to their families even in the case of the two Israeli soldiers only for them to have a proper burial and their families a grave to grieve at is bound to leave a legacy of ability on both sides to overcome their deeply ingrained mutual hatred and distrust This will stand them in good stead when addressing longerterm and more fundamental disagreements through diplomatic negotiations rather than bloodshed Yossi Mekelberg is professor of international relations at Regents University London where he is head of the International Relations and Social Sciences Program He is also an associate

West monopolize the global conversation the plight of Syrias civilian population seems to have been all but forgotten Trapped in a country devastated by 10 years of civil war the lives of ordinary Syrians are being buffeted by a collapsing currency medicine shortages skyrocketing inflation and deepening poverty And by all accounts the worst is yet to come As the Caesar Act the tough new Syriaspecific US legislation entered into force on June 17 the official exchange rate for the dollar nearly doubled jumping from 704 to 1256 Syrian pounds The previous day the blackmarket value had fallen sharply with 2950 Syrian pounds instead of 2850 fetching 1 The Caesar Act seeks not just to prevent members of President Bashar Assads inner circle from continuing to profit from the war but also to hold them accountable for crimes against humanity While the ultimate objective may be to cut off Assad from Iran Hezbollah and Russia and force him to share power with the opposition regular people in Syria and Lebanon are already feeling the pinch The Syrian exchange rate has been fluctuating since the beginning of June forcing many shops in Damascus to put up the shutters as it becomes difficult for traders to set prices The latest shockwaves come even as the full impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy is yet to be felt RK 54 a workingclass mother of three said she was sent home when the lockdowns started in March without her last salary If not for the money I received from friends abroad I have no idea how my family wouldve survived especially with my son being badly injured and my two daughters unemployed she told Arab News We used my husbands last paycheck to pay the rent and were left with only a few potatoes and no cash MH a 30yearold resident of Damascus who works in drama productions complained about the pernicious effects of stagnant and meager wages on top of an eroding currency and hyperinflation My salary lasted only a week or 10 days before the coronavirus lockdown Now although the lockdown has ended in Damascus my salary barely lasts three days she told Arab News Referring to the Caesar Act whose sanctions provisions are now fully in effect she said she has no idea what to expect other than that definitely there will be no substantial pay raise MH summed up the prevailing mood of doom and gloom thus I suggest instead of all these sanctions which are slowly draining life out of people in Syria how about they execute us by firing squad Reacting to the situation more matteroffactly Amina F 31 a Damascusbased content writer and emarketing professional said Proactive measures should have been taken to mitigate the effects of the Caesar Act The Syrian capital probably does not even typify the worst impact of the economic crisis Deteriorating living conditions left residents of Suwayda a governmentcontrolled region mainly populated by Druze with no option but to take to the streets earlier this month in large numbers In its Syria mVAM survey report released in April the World Food Program WFP noted that the availability of food in markets is diminishing and prices are rising as a result of the depreciation of the Syrian pound The report tallied the losses caused by the forced suspension of many economic activities as well as the partial curfews imposed by the government to prevent the spread of COVID19 The report said the restrictions took their toll on jobs and earnings with 67 percent of households interviewed in Suwayda reporting the loss of one or more sources of income Assad issued a decree on June 11 firing Prime Minister Imad Khamis and naming Hussein Arnous the water resources minister as his successor The order did not cite any specific reason for the dismissal of Khamis who had been appointed to the top job in 2016 Just days earlier in a post on his official Facebook account Ghassan Fattoum a former head of the Syria Journalists Union wrote It is strange that there are still those who import and experiment with solutions in hopes of finding the right solution but we did not and will not reach a solution if we continue to churn out a traditional vision that lacks creative solutions for managing the states resources in an optimal way Kevin DeJesus assistant professor at the John Hazen White College of Arts and Sciences at Johnson and Wales University said he has no doubt that Syrias already vulnerable population will suffer further due to the Caesar Act Well witness a deepening and more complex crisis in the country as these sanctions will have economic and humanitarian repercussions he told Arab News As time marches on the effects of this crisis will mirror the dire humanitarian effects of the US sanctions strategy in Iraq which devastated civilian life while Saddam Hussein retained power Not even the deadly coronavirus pandemic prompted the West to lift or ease sanctions targeting the Assad regime If there is a compelling new case for the same governments to walk their policy back it has yet to be made by Damascus The European Commission published on May 12 a report on its official website that ruled out any negative impact on Syrias medical response to COVID19 Opinion This section contains relevant reference points placed in Opinion field EU sanctions do not prohibit the export to Syria of respirators disinfectants hand sanitizers or detergents used to respond to COVID19 the report said adding that traders need to make sure that these goods will not be used for military purposes or internal repression Syrian Health Minister Nizar Yazigi said the Caesar Act will impede the supply of medical equipment and medicines for chronic diseases by not exempting the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade which is responsible for importing medicines At the same time he added There is no shortage of any drug substance and although there might be a shortage of certain brands there are alternatives Whatever the truth residents of Damascus have been complaining of medicine shortages since early June prompting some activists to start a Facebook group titled Together better whose members share the medicines they have but do not use and are willing to give away The Syria mVAM report of April noted that only 57 public hospitals are functioning and there are significant shortages of trained health workers Against a backdrop of what looks like a looming humanitarian crisis DeJesus believes the tide will turn against the US sanctions The world will grow alarmed at the deepening hunger unemployment collapse of social structures and crucially the inability of the large Syrian diaspora to send remittances and development resources to people back home he said On a geopolitical level he added a year from now the US will have further ceded influence to China and Russia Criminal syndicates and blackmarket economies will flourish and the network around the Syrian president which has protected his power will only hold tighter to that power as they weather this considerable but not insurmountable challenge DeJesus said Camille Otrakji a SyrianCanadian analyst believes the Caesar sanctions will not force Russia to abandon Syria To fully reinstate its superpower status Russia will need a diplomatic success like a deal to end the decadelong war in Syria he told Arab News The Trump administration is saying both publicly and privately that its interested in a deal but some US officials are insisting on terms that the authorities in Damascus arent willing to accommodate A withdrawal of all foreign troops except those of Russia is one possibility Iran understands that a deal would have to include some degree of attenuation of its presence in Syria Looking to the future Otrakji said There are two significant milestones to watch within the next year The US presidential elections in November 2020 and the Syrian presidential elections in July 2021 AnanTello

Destroyed Syria Assads Atrocities Not Sanctions Have Destroyed Syria Exclusive for Asharq AlAwsat Today as the United States announces new sanctions under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 it is important to focus on the reasoning behind this legislation Passed overwhelmingly six months ago by both Houses of Congress and signed into effect by President Trump the Act is named in honor of a brave Syrian photographer with the codename Caesar who documented with his camera tens of thousands of incidents of abuse and violation of Syrian citizens by Syrian President Assads henchmen There is continued legitimate interest from Congress on the implementation of this legislation A joint statement by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on June 8 documented Congresss priority vigorous sustained enforcement of the Caesar Act in order to send a message to the regime and its enablers that Assad remains a pariah Two recently issued United Nations reports support the views of these Congressional leaders and highlight the Assad regime is atrocities which have destroyed Syria its economy and its ability to respond to COVID19 On April 6th the United Nations Board of Inquiry issued a report outlining how the evidence indicated what we all suspected that the Assad regime and its allies launched attacks that devastated hospitals schools and other civilian infrastructure even when the sites locations were on the UN deconfliction list created to identify and protect these key pillars of civilian life That same week the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Investigation and Identification Team released its first report and attributed to the Assad regime responsibility for using sarin or chlorine in three separate attacks in 2017 These are but two examples of the war that the Assad regime often with help from its Iranian and Russian enablers has waged devastating Syrias citizens and leaving an estimated 500000 dead Caesar Act mandatory sanctions target those that facilitate the Assad regime is production of oil as well as those that facilitate the regime is acquisition of aviation related goods services or technologies that are used for military purposes We aim to stop these acquisitions that further the regime is ability to carry out its terrible crimes The Act also targets those that support mercenaries and foreign actors who are perpetuating the conflict on behalf of the regime and its allies Finally it targets those involved in war profiteering who provide significant construction or engineering services to the Syrian regime Individuals and businesses worldwide that engage in reconstruction activities with the Assad regime now face deepening sanctions risk The Caesar Act is significant impact is longterm it aims to foreclose any potential economic benefit from a military victory by the regime and its enablers The goal of the United States in pursuing these additional targeted sanctions using existing authorities and those contained in the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 against the regime and its enablers is thus to promote accountability and deny them access to the international financial system until a political solution to the Syria conflict can be reached Such a solution must be in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 the internationally accepted roadmap for a political settlement to the Syrian War Before the Assad regime is allowed to rejoin the global community and take part in the global economy it must also hold accountable those responsible for war crimes and other atrocitieshuman rights abuses no longer sponsor terrorism and create the conditions for the safe dignified and voluntary return of refugees The regime must also verifiably and permanently dismantle its chemical weapons program and sever its ties with Iran is military forces and Iraniansupported groups This roadmap forward is not only vital for the longsuffering Syrian people but also for regional stability Instability including terrorism exploiting the security vacuum created by the Syrian conflict has drawn in conventional forces from the US and four other states with stateonstate conflict an everpresent risk until the Syrian conflict can be brought under control Recent calls by the Assad regime and its Russian allies to relax sanctions in response to COVID19 should be seen for what they are a cynical ploy to give the Syrian regime both a military victory and cover to enrich Assad and his enablers Contrary to regime propaganda Assad is choice of war over peace not US sanctions has destroyed the country and its economy Bashar alAssad chooses to use rapidly dwindling cash reserves to pursue a vicious war against millions of Syrians that has devastated Syria economically at a time when COVID19 is spreading among Syria is already vulnerable citizens United States sanctions target Assad and his regime is illegitimate wealth not these citizens The United States has provided more than 106 billion dollars in humanitarian aid for Syria more than any other single donor and we are working to facilitate access for all to have COVID19 testing kits and associated materials Tragically this is the same assistance that the Assad regime has historically stolen and sold back to the Syrian people at exorbitant prices To make matters worse this past January as COVID19 gained speed Syria is Russian patrons in the United Nation is Security Council blocked two of four border crossings for the facilitation of UN humanitarian assistance The US will continue to provide and facilitate humanitarian aid to the people of Syria while promoting accountability for those responsible for atrocities and blocking a political solution Assad can end this needless war only by declaring a nationwide ceasefire constructively participating in the Constitutional Committee talks in Geneva and implementing a political vision that puts the Syrian people is democratic aspirations first The world is watching and whoever makes deals with the regime is at risk of being sanctioned

disturbing signs that Daesh is reemerging especially in the open deserts of Syria and Iraq Last week newly appointed Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa AlKadhimi announced that Iraqi forces had foiled a major operation by Daesh while his intelligence body revealed it had arrested a key figure in the group Abdel Nasser Qardash who is thought to have been nominated as the successor to Abu Bakr AlBaghdadi who was killed by US Special Forces in Idlib last October Reports point to the fact that clusters of the extremist group have become active in Iraq especially during Ramadan Militants have struck several military and civilian targets in western and central Iraq in recent weeks The head of Iraqs joint military operations Maj Gen Tahsin AlKhafaji confirmed that Daeshrelated attacks had increased as the country shifted its resources toward containing the spread of the coronavirus The scene is even worse in Syria where Daesh militants claimed responsibility for a number of bloody attacks against proDamascus militias as well as Syrian Democratic Forces SDF fighters during Ramadan The Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced that no less than 60 government and SDF members have been killed in Homs and Deir Ezzor in the past few weeks while Daesh claimed responsibility for a number of these attacks On Friday US Central Command announced that coalition forces had killed two key Daesh leaders in an airstrike in Deir Ezzor Following the groups defeat in Syria in March last year thousands of Daesh fighters were taken prisoner by the SDF in northeastern Syria Efforts to repatriate foreign fighters have failed while the SDFs hold weakened as a result of attacks against its positions by Turkish troops and proAnkara rebel groups In October it was reported that hundreds of Daesh fighters had escaped from internment camps in northern Syria Experts believe that most of them were able to regroup while hiding in the vast deserts straddling Syria and Iraq Iraq had declared victory over Daesh in 2017 but political squabbling Iranian interventions in Iraqi affairs and the controversial role played by the proIran Popular Mobilization Forces PMF deflected attention from the main task of rounding up the hundreds of Daesh fighters who were able to flee Tensions between the US and Iran especially following Januarys assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani and a PMF leader near Baghdad airport have allowed clusters of Daesh fighters to regroup and carry out fresh attacks There is no doubt that Daesh like AlQaeda is changing its strategy and trying to adapt to new geopolitical realities With Russia Turkey the US and Iran carrying out conflicting agendas in Syria and with economic and political turmoil still crippling Iraq militants are making good use of the resultant vacuum What is particularly worrying is that the nefarious ideology perpetuated by Daesh continues to attract volunteers at various levels The lack of a political solution in Syria has compounded the humanitarian catastrophe there allowing Daesh to pursue its recruitment efforts A dysfunctional sectarianbased political system in Iraq has failed to stamp out corruption end ethnic and sectarian tensions and undercut foreign interference in Iraqi affairs Again under an inequitable system that disenfranchises millions Daesh is bound to find disillusioned supporters Meanwhile the international coalition against Daesh is unraveling for a number of reasons Iraqis want the US and its NATO allies out of their country while demanding an end to Tehrans interventions And fighting the coronavirus crisis and containing its dire economic and social consequences has become the main objective for most world governments But these governments should be aware that the current health crisis will deepen socioeconomic disparities in the form of rising poverty and unemployment rates as economies struggle to recover In the absence of transparency good governance and openness extremist ideologies can only flourish Opting for an ironfist rule under the guise of fighting the pandemic could easily backfire And even when the dust settles and the coronavirus is contained we must remember that our region continues to suffer from civil wars foreign interventions and sectarian divides all elements that contribute to instability injustice and radical backlashes We are yet to see an end to the conflicts in Yemen Syria Iraq and Libya among others All of these ongoing conflicts could act as incubators for Daeshlike groups Security solutions are needed momentarily to offset a regional threat that can still be contained But governments must look beyond the short term and focus on the core reasons why extremist ideologies continue to attract disillusioned men and women While Daesh may never be able to repeat its initial success of building an entity that stretched between Syria and Iraq resulting in horrific and unforgettable crimes against humanity states cannot afford to look the other way as militants attempt to regroup Taking our eyes off Daesh at this critical moment may prove catastrophic Osama AlSharif is a

by the US Navy The IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the US vessels at extremely close range and high speeds including multiple crossings of the Puller with a 50yard closest point of approach and within 10 yards of Maui is bow The US crews issued multiple warnings via bridgetobridge radio five short blasts from the ships horns and longrange acoustic noise maker devices but received no response from the IRGCN This is not the first time that Tehran has been implicated in acting dangerously in international waters For instance in May 2019 four tankers were attacked close to the port of Fujairah off the coast of the UAE A month later two other tankers the Japanese Kokuka Courageous and the Norwegian Front Altair were sabotaged while crossing the Gulf of Oman One went up in flames while the other was left to be towed away In a third incident a few weeks later the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC released a video showing commandos in black ski masks and military fatigues descending from a helicopter to seize a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz The Iranians would on go to shoot down an American drone that was operating in international airspace Tehran is most likely violating international law specifically the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea The theocratic establishment of Iran is a signatory to this UN convention but has long refrained from ratifying it Top Iranian officials have also resorted to heated rhetoric likely to add fuel to the fire and further ratchet up the tensions In the wake of this month is incident Foreign

Screengrab When Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the global assembly of the World Health Organization WHO this week he stressed that a vaccine for the coronavirus disease COVID19 should be made available to all This was in stark contrast to the controversy surrounding French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi whose CEO Paul Hudson declared last week that any vaccine the company produced would be made available in America first because the US had contributed most to its development Not so fast responded French President Emmanuel Macron insisting that he would not allow a French company to give priority to a foreign country in this manner The company subsequently backtracked on its pledge We are smack bang in the middle of a controversy over whether vaccines and medications constitute global public goods or if their access should be controlled by countries or the companies that own the intellectual property This issue is often discussed in regard to superexpensive medications like Novartis spinal muscular atrophy drug Zolgensma which costs a prohibitive 21 million taking its accessibility well beyond what is affordable to health insurance schemes or national health care systems let alone individual households A decision by the company to give away 100 treatment cycles through a lottery did nothing to calm that debate Zolgensma is a specific drug for a specific and rare illness Things become much more complicated when we are dealing with public health emergencies The US which has a whole raft of issues with the WHO explicitly declined to support a resolution that would have allowed poor countries to ignore patents to gain access to COVID19 vaccines or treatments A particular bone of contention was that the motion referred to the World Trade Organization is WTO 2001 Doha Declaration which allows countries to overrule intellectual property rights in the case of a public health emergency The UK Japan and Switzerland are also said to have opposed the language referring to the Doha Declaration The pharmaceutical industry is important to the economies of those three countries just as it is in the US So we are back to the question of who should have ultimate control over access to medication Companies countries or the global public There are good arguments for all three approaches The research and development of new drugs is very expensive which means there is an economic need for companies to make a return on that investment If they are not allowed to do so they will not fund future research and development Without groundbreaking new treatments for diseases humanity as a whole will be worse off Meanwhile countries have a fiduciary responsibility to look after their citizens Public health is certainly part of that responsibility Some countries in the developed world ensure access to health care for all with the UK is National Health Service being the poster child of that model In others like the US health care is less accessible especially for the poor This being said health care nationalism has certainly been a feature of the COVID19 pandemic with regard to personal protective equipment and it is bound to become more prominent once we have vaccines or antiviral drugs Some countries may have a valid argument for demanding first dibs on a particular medication when research was partially funded by their taxpayers The latest example of this was the UK is AstraZeneca this week receiving more than 1 billion from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for its COVID19 vaccine development scheme in conjunction with Oxford University The global public good argument is an excellent one especially in times of a public health crisis Relief from a pandemic should be made available to all of humanity which is ultimately for the greater good Aside from the humanitarian aspect a pandemic cannot be contained in a globally interconnected world if it is allowed to spread rapidly in poorer countries In other words and in this specific case making COVID19 vaccines and antiviral drugs accessible to all is in the interest of humanity at large This explains why ministers agreed to the WTO is Doha Declaration in November 2001 We are at the intersection of commercial interests national interests and the global public good Cornelia Meyer We are at the intersection of commercial interests national interests and the global public good Sadly the first two tend to be better funded and selfinterest tends to be more easily advocated than the third It takes a lot of multilateral interdisciplinary and multipolar negotiations as well as time before something is universally agreed on as a global public good In the case of this pandemic we lack the time Multilateral mechanisms have also been undermined over the last few years and this is particularly evident in the current debate surrounding the WTO It is hard for multilateral organizations to function without the support of the largest countries and it may be impossible to do so with the explicit opposition of the world is largest economy In the end we can only hope that the global family of nations understands that it is in everybody is interest for the pandemic to be contained worldwide This may prove to be the strongest argument to make COVID19 vaccines and antiviral drugs accessible to every human being on the planet The road to get there will be not easy There is not just a funding element to this but a huge logistical angle too Both will require the cooperation and leadership of companies countries

years pledge of 6 billion euros In an extensive interview with Asharq AlAwsat he said the Europeans have provided some 20 billion euros to Syria since the eruption of its crisis in 2011 The Brussels Conference is our most effective tool to maintain the worlds attention on the need to solve this conflict and to continue mobilizing the international community around a political solution he said We will continue to do our part As in previous Brussels Conferences on Syria we have invited neither the regime nor the opposition This might be reconsidered only and once a political process is firmly under way including free elections as foreseen under UN Security Council resolution 2254 he added During all these years our vital support has reached the Syrian people The Syrian regime bears responsibility for the humanitarian economic and healthcare crises in Syria Not sanctions Borrell stated What do you expect of the donor conference in Brussels on June 30 How does this one differ from the previous ones Syria entered its tenth year of war In the past nine years half of the Syrian population had to flee their homes Over half a million people died An entire generation of Syrian children has only known war They all deserve a better peaceful future The Brussels Conference is our most effective tool to maintain the worlds attention on the need to solve this conflict and to continue mobilizing the international community around a political solution as called for in UN Security Council resolution 2254 This is the only way to bring back lasting peace and stability for Syrians The Conference will be 2020s main pledging event for Syria and the region addressing the critical needs generated by the crisis but it goes way beyond a donor conference It is about continuing to support politically and financially Syria is neighbors and their people who have shown extraordinary solidarity towards Syrian refugees It has also grown into a unique opportunity for Syrias civil society to engage in direct dialogue with the donor community and refugeehosting countries We could not gather people physically this year but we built a week of events where Syrias youth women and civil society organizations could interact with the international community This is crucial not only because they are the voices of the Syrian people but also because they hold the key to a better future for Syria A few factors raise the stakes for this years Conference The grave deterioration of the economic and humanitarian situation the recent military offensive from the part of the regime and its supporters the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as the ongoing coronavirus crisis all further exacerbate already dire living conditions of the Syrians They have had enough Together with the United Nations who play a crucial and leading role we are sparing no efforts to remain at their side and live up to their hope for a brighter and peaceful future Last years conference provided aid worth 62 billion euros Do you think that you would get the same pledges this year Would you be able to respond to the United Nations appeal for humanitarian aid It is impossible to give a figure of likely pledging ahead of this years Conference Amounts also vary from year to year depending on donors approaches We remain as ambitious as we are every year in support of the Syrian people and their host communities in neighboring countries We are all working together not least with our cochair the United Nations to ensure that Syrians across the whole of Syria as well as refugees in Jordan Lebanon and Turkey can continue receiving the support and protection of the international community over the coming year That is the least they should expect and the least we can do As the European Union we have provided over 20 billion euros since the beginning of the crisis in humanitarian stabilization development and economic assistance We are the biggest donor for Syrian people Two thirds of all the money spent to help Syrians and Syrias neighbors came from the EU and its member states And we will continue to do our part On top of the unprecedented humanitarian and economic crisis and all the suffering they have been going through Syrians are now also enduring the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic This years Conference will also address this issue As EU we have been adapting our current assistance in response to this new and additional challenge working hard to ensure that lifesaving equipment reaches those in need in Syria Why was the Syrian government not invited to the Brussels conference As in previous Brussels Conferences on Syria we have invited neither the regime nor the opposition This might be reconsidered only and once a political process is firmly under way including free elections as foreseen under UN Security Council resolution 2254 The resolution clearly states that the Syrian people will decide the future of Syria This is not just nice words for the EU it is our compass Nobody should hold their future hostage This is why we are ensuring a meaningful input and a very large involvement of Syrias civil society with extensive online consultations held ahead of the Conference in Syria and in the region Days of Dialogue also took place virtually on 22 and 23 June consisting of discussions between civil society ministers and senior decisionmakers from refugeehosting countries the EU the United Nations and other international partners These contributions will feed in the Ministerial meeting of the Conference on 30 June Syrias civil society its aid workers its women and youth organizations are the future of the country How would you explain Russia is participation in the conference despite its criticism of not inviting the Syrian government As in previous years all those members of the international community with influence in the conflict in Syria and that have expressed a will to support diplomatic efforts in accordance with UN Security Council relevant resolutions have been invited In this regard the EU welcomes the participation of the Russian Federation The conference comes after the European Union renewed economic sanctions against Damascus and the start of implementing the US Caesar Act Does it have any effect on Brussels conference One of the key objectives of the Conference is for the international community to come together behind the UNfacilitated and Syrianled political process International pressure on Damascus to fully and genuinely participate in negotiations in the framework of UN Security Council resolution 2254 which is also done through sanctions is of course part of this effort Moscow and Damascus say that these sanctions will harm the flow of the humanitarian and medical aid Whats your reply EU sanctions are neither new nor aimed at the civilian population They target individuals and entities that have been supporting the repression and the regime financing them or benefitting from the war economy They are designed not to impede the delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance including crucial support in the current situation of the coronavirus pandemic They do not prohibit the export of food medicines or medical equipment Even for potentially dangerous dualuse goods for example chemicals also needed for pharmaceutical use a number of exceptions are foreseen for humanitarian purposes The EU has been and remains the largest humanitarian donor to the Syria crisis with over 20 billion euros mobilized since 2011 During all these years our vital support has reached the Syrian people The Syrian regime bears responsibility for the humanitarian economic and healthcare crises in Syria Not sanctions On the contrary it is mostly thanks to international assistance that healthcare food education or protection can still be delivered to people in need inside Syria I could also add that trade has also continued throughout the war between the EU and Syria We have never placed Syria under any kind of embargo What are the conditions that the European Union can lift the sanctions against Damascus EU sanctions concerning Syria have been in place since 9 May 2011 in response to the Syrian regimes violent repression against its own people including human rights violations the use of live ammunition against peaceful protesters and the proliferation and use of chemical weapons These were not imposed lightly They are the consequence of grave human rights violations and potential war crimes and crimes against humanity which must be accounted for Our list now includes 273 individuals and 70 entities The goal of these measures is to put pressure on the Syrian regime to halt repression and negotiate a lasting political settlement of the Syrian crisis in line with UN Security Council resolution 2254 under UN auspices Without a change of behavior and a constructive and genuine commitment to the political process sanctions will remain They are part and parcel of the EUs wider approach to the Syria crisis We also review them constantly to assess inter alia effects and developments on the ground EU has linked any contribution to the reconstruction of Syria with the success of the political process in Syria What is your position on the reconstruction of Syria now The EU has been very clear on this Europeans are willing to support the future of the Syria population and help them reconstruct their country but there are parameters for the EU is engagement The EU will only participate in Syria is reconstruction when a genuine political transition in line with UN Security Council resolution 2254 is firmly underway If this is not the case all efforts will be in vain Reconstruction requires minimal conditions in terms of stability governance public accountability and representativeness of the governing authorities Syria currently fulfils none of these criteria The EUs reconstruction support cannot be invested in a context that would exacerbate prewar inequalities and grievances and would not lead to reconciliation and peace building The focus of reconstruction is not simply to rebuild infrastructure and housing it is about restoring Syrias social fabric rebuilding trust and creating conditions that will mitigate or prevent the recurrence of violence as well as responding to the grievances that sparked the conflict Syrians deserve to live in a country where they all feel safe and protected by an impartial judiciary and by the rule of law and where human dignity is ensured The Brussels conference is cochaired by the United Nations What is your position on the efforts of the UN Envoy to Syria Geir Pedersen Our position remains that only a political solution achieved in the framework of UNbrokered Geneva negotiations can guarantee a peaceful future for Syria We fully support the work of the United Nations and of UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen The Brussels Conferences aim at rallying the international community behind the UN efforts to advance a political solution The Conference will also back the calls by UN SecretaryGeneral António Guterres and Special Envoy Pedersen towards a nationwide ceasefire and the release of detainees especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic Russia announced its willingness to negotiate with America to reach a political solution in Syria What is your position on the AmericanRussian dialogue on Syria Any progress towards the political resolution of the Syria conflict is to be welcomed We insist that there should be no compromise on certain principles Both Russia and the US support UN Security Council resolution 2254 and any solution to the Syria conflict must be in line with that resolution For us in the EU there can be no normalization of relations with the Syrian regime and by extension no commitment of international funding for reconstruction until there is real engagement in a genuine comprehensive and inclusive political process Also the return of refugees to Syria could only be supported by the international community only under the condition that they would be guaranteed to be safe voluntary and dignified Do you think a US Russia deal will be enough How does it look like for you Again the future of Syria is for the Syrians to decide This is what UN Security Council resolution 2254 says The political negotiations on Syria is future must be Syrianowned and Syrianled Both the US and Russia as permanent members of the Security Council have committed to support the genuine comprehensive and inclusive political process set out in UN Security Council resolution 2254 Currently Syria has three spheres of influence North East of Syria North west and the rest of the country Does the European Union have the same vision for these zones The European Union will not waver in its commitment to the full sovereignty territorial integrity and unity of Syria Precise governance arrangements within Syria are a matter for the Syrians to decide In 2021 there will be presidential election in Syria How do you see that How do you see Syria in one year from now Meaningful elections in Syria will be those held on the basis of a new Syrian Constitution as foreseen in UN Security Council resolution 2254 They will mark the opening of a new chapter for the country and for its people If other elections are held before that I encourage the Syrian regime to demonstrate its commitment to genuine political openness for instance by making sure they are open to all Syrians including those abroad and that they are free and fair However in no way will this replace the need for real engagement in a political process and for the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 2254 How Syria will look a year from now will depend on the commitment of the regime to the implementation of that resolution as the only internationally accepted way forward Not for our benefit not for theirs or their supporters but for the benefit of all Syrians

Throughout the country initiatives have sprung up to manufacture thousands of items of lifesaving PPE which have been donated to hospitals and essential workers One such resourceful helper is Sara Martin She tested positive for COVID19 and during selfisolation decided to assist in making masks with friends who were part of a local carnival group called A Contrareloj meaning race against the clock in the municipality of Sesena about 34 km south of the capital Madrid Having contracted COVID19 she was unable to take part in the physical production process but was able to manage the group is Facebook page through which she could contact organizations in need of masks and coordinate donations of materials to make them Other members of the group took a break from making carnival costumes and turned their needlework skills to the task of sewing masks in their homes each one in charge of a specific job We are a group of seven women volunteers who are making masks Together we have made more than 3000 masks and counting We distribute them in packages with the help of volunteers and they also bring new material so we can keep making more said Sonia Hornero one of the women from the

glassware and packaging Through their project Juntos Venceremos COVID19 meaning together we will combat COVID19 they have donated thousands of the protectors to more than 120 health centers in different cities throughout Spain Gilsanz said We started this project together with our friends who are in manufacturing The production is approximately 18000 masks The recipients of these masks are all kinds of healthcare workers It befits them since it is a method that prevents them from possible infection The masks were made at the GEIMU factory in Toledo 67 km from Madrid which is owned by Almazan The initial idea was to make 50 or 60 for our friends Then we made the decision to make 3000 as a start which we completed in a week and then another 12000 and so on The recipients of these masks are very grateful to receive them since they are not only protecting them from contagion but also avoiding their faces becoming bruised he said Sara del Alamo a nurse at Valdemoro Hospital in Madrid said We are very thankful for all the help we are getting particularly to them Juntos Venceremos COVID19 Thanks to these masks our faces have fewer marks and also they are protecting us a lot

border crossing with Turkey Ever since 2014 the UN has been authorized via a Security Council resolution to transport aid on trucks across the Turkish border into Syria Such resolutions used to be renewed every 12 months The next due date is on Friday This humanitarian mechanism is designed to deliver aid to areas outside the control of the Syrian regime which otherwise would not typically have been able to receive it across lines of control inside the country Russia has always taken the opportunity to object to and block the resolutions as it is now It argues that the crossborder mechanism has become a political tool for drawing lines of division inside Syria some cheek given Russia is actions in the country This time Moscow could use its veto with devastating effect Already in January Russia insisted that the renewal period as specified in UN Security Council resolution 2504 should be for six months and that the AlYarubiyah crossing with Iraq would not be covered This border closure has led to serious medical shortages for the 22 million Syrians in the northeast of the country 64 percent of whom are in need of humanitarian assistance For this week is renewal the UN secretarygeneral and most of the Security Council want to revert to 12 months and reopen the Iraq crossing point However China might support Russia as it wants to see more aid going via Damascus Moscow appears to be offering another six months but with only one crossing not two in the northwest The added imperative this time if one were needed is the coronavirus disease pandemic as millions of Syrians undernourished and in crowded and unsanitary camps are particularly vulnerable due to their limited or even nonexistent access to health care The UN says that 62 million Syrians live outside of Syrian government control of whom 42 million require humanitarian assistance The Syrian regime has routinely claimed that aid coming across the Turkish border goes to terrorists For the most part aid agencies have to decide whether to operate in regimecontrolled or oppositioncontrolled areas The regime insists that all aid agencies including the UN go through Damascus should they wish to operate anywhere in Syria In theory this is correct in that the sovereign government would normally exercise jurisdiction But the harsh reality is that Damascus has consistently politicized aid deciding who gets its and who gets the related contracts ie regime cronies It is a regime that has deployed the starvation of civilians as a weapon of war and has been the party responsible for nearly all of the 595 attacks on more than 350 health facilities in the last nine years For these reasons crossline aid has never been sufficient to replace crossborder supplies The area covered by crossborder aid has shrunk as the regime has restored its control over larger areas of Syria However 4 million people in Idlib in the northwest are more dependent on crossborder aid than ever which is why the number of trucks crossing every month has rocketed to record levels The regime claims these people are terrorists and while extremist groups are present most are civilians with many of them internally displaced If Russian stonewalling does lead to a veto of the current draft GermanBelgian resolution at the Security Council it would mean no World Health Organization delivery of medical supplies including coronavirus testing kits The World Food Programme would also not be able to take food parcels in for the nearstarving In short it risks an incalculable and catastrophic humanitarian event All of this matters even more because of the horrendous financial meltdown Syria is experiencing The UN says food prices are 200 percent higher than this time last year Food has never been more expensive in the nine years of conflict The Syrian pound has collapsed and with it the population is purchasing power A mix of causes includes the war itself the Lebanese economic crisis the coronavirus pandemic and the perennial cronyism of the regime Who knows how many billions of dollars Syrians have trapped inside the Lebanese banking system On top of this are US and EU sanctions that render any economic recovery far harder with the most recent American sanctions under the socalled Caesar Act entering into force last month If the current draft resolution is vetoed it risks an incalculable and catastrophic humanitarian event Chris Doyle The fate of the Syrian economy has become perhaps the key humanitarian issue If this is not addressed no amount of aid will be sufficient The UN sought 10 billion in aid for Syria but at the EUUN Brussels IV Conference at the end of June only 69 billion 77 billion was pledged This goal speaks volumes about the impending disaster all the more so if major fighting resumes over Idlib As ever with Syria the priority is never the humanitarian situation facing civilians Russia will in all likelihood determine its position not on aid access grounds and need but the state of talks between itself and Turkey over the future of Idlib Civilians are pawns in the great game just as Turkey uses refugees to blackmail the EU and various EU states barricade their borders to avoid taking their fair share What might trouble the Syrian regime are not the starving masses but the increasing numbers back on the streets ready to protest once more

countries in the world when it comes to the number of people who have been infected with the coronavirus disease COVID19 or died because of it According to the official figures more than 3000 people have died and almost 50000 have been infected with the virus in Iran This means that more than 6 percent of those infected have died which is significantly higher than in other countries However unofficial statistics put the number of deaths far higher According to opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran the real death toll across 228 towns and cities in all 31 Iranian provinces had as of March 27 surpassed 12400 The regimes incompetence in handling the crisis from the outset such as continuing to allow flights to operate to and from Qom and refraining from quarantining the city which was the center of the countrys outbreak has undoubtedly played a key role in the large scale of the humanitarian catastrophe In addition the regimes attempts to conceal the truth have further exacerbated the situation Because of the crisis some governments have decided to offer Iran financial aid upon the Iranian leaders request The regime has asked the USbased International Monetary Fund IMF for financial assistance for the first time in 60 years It asked for a 5 billion emergency loan after the IMF made 50 billion available to assist countries with the coronavirus crisis Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif posted a tweet addressed to the IMF IMFs KGeorgieva has stated that countries affected by COVID19 will be supported via Rapid Financial Instrument Our Central Bank requested access to this facility immediately IMFIMF Board should adhere to Funds mandate stand on right side of history act responsibly Meanwhile the EU has decided to give Iran 20 million 21 million But governments and international organizations must be extremely cautious about giving the Iranian regime any direct financial assistance This is due to the fact that throughout the history of the Islamic Republic any extra revenues obtained by the leadership have never trickled down to the ordinary people One recent example is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA aka the Iran nuclear deal When it was signed in 2015 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani promised that the deal would help the Iranian people financially When the crippling UN and US sanctions were lifted as a result of the JCPOA Iran rejoined the global financial system and its oil and gas industries had a fresh start Tehran subsequently increased its oil exports from 1 million barrels per day to about 4 million Asian imports from Iran jumped by more than 90 percent according to Irans state news outlets Sales to Turkey and other European nations also rose quickly and Iran soon became the thirdlargest producer in OPEC Iran also attracted foreign investments Nevertheless domestically speaking the regimes increased revenues did not reach the general population or ease the lives of ordinary Iranian people Unemployment and inflation remained at record highs This is partially due to the fact that Irans financial deals were mostly conducted at the governmental level The beneficiaries of those financial gains were mainly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC and the Office of the Supreme Leader In fact corruption and economic mismanagement exacerbated the economic problems of ordinary citizens In addition as the hardliners gained more financial power restrictions on freedom and social justice increased The extra revenue gave Iran the necessary financial clout to pursue its strategic and regional ambitions It emboldened the IRGC which flexed its muscles in several countries in the region This led to heightened tensions between Iran and its regional rivals causing further insecurity conflicts and humanitarian tragedies Throughout the history of the Islamic Republic any extra revenues obtained by the leadership have never trickled down to the ordinary people Dr Majid Rafizadeh So if money should not be handed to the regime directly what can be done to help the Iranian people during this crisis The best option would be to give the funds that Iran has requested to international health organizations or credible civil society groups The regime must also be forced to allow medical staff and health organizations from other countries to enter Iran Other conditions could include pressuring the authorities to reveal the truth about the scope of the coronavirus outbreak in the country and ordering it to stop spending money on its nuclear activities and military adventurism in the region amid this public health crisis Financial assistance should not be given directly to the Iranian regime because it will be funneled into supporting the IRGC and the terror and militia groups it supports across the region Aid must instead be directed to trustworthy international and civil society organizations if the crisis is to be eased Dr Majid Rafizadeh is an IranianAmerican political scientist He is a leading expert on Iran and US foreign policy a businessman and president of the International American Council Twitter

trucks of humanitarian aid to the Syrian province of Idlib The area that has witnessed heavy fighting since last December has been calm in recent weeks allowing the humanitarian aid to be delivered and 73000 people who fled to the Turkish border to return The coronavirus disease COVID19 is a factor in ensuring that the truce agreed between Russia and Turkey on March 5 has held Both the Russians and the Turks do not want to put their soldiers at risk of being infected so troop movements have been restricted The MoscowAnkara agreement also aimed to create a safe zone along the M4 highway but such areas have seen breaches by the warring parties The ceasefire needs to be longlasting in order to allow the people who have fled the violence to relocate and avoid them suffering multiple rounds of displacement Previous Syrian ceasefires have been more of a series of short breaks before all parties resume another round of hostilities This illustrates the need for a third party to be present The UN is a neutral and credible party that has deployed peacekeeping missions around the world and maintained stability in critical areas For example Southern Lebanon has for the past 14 years not witnessed any clashes between Hezbollah and Israel because of the presence of UN forces The international community should capitalize on the demilitarized zones agreed between the Russians and the Turks to create a development area where internally displaced people can relocate There is no more room for additional refugees Turkey hosts 35 million Syrian refugees and cant take anymore Lebanon is being crushed under the weight of its own problems and Europe has closed its borders In fact COVID19 makes it almost impossible for any country to accept refugees This highlights the crucial importance of having safe zones inside of Syria itself However a safe zone needs to have connectivity access to basic services and be able to create jobs The zones need to be sustainable as there is no sign of an imminent political settlement between the opposition and the regime that would bring enduring peace and stability The constitutional committee is not making any substantial progress and Bashar Assad is not showing any changes in his behavior that could bring an end to the conflict The UN failed to convince the different stakeholders to lay down their arms entirely but it might be able to do that in certain areas in Syria Though Assad is unwilling to make any concessions to end the conflict countries like Turkey and Russia might agree to compromise to minimize their losses meaning they may be receptive to the idea of deconfliction zones Also such zones would transfer some of the weight of the conflict that those countries are carrying to the UN Prior to the UN taking over Turkey and Russia should clear the areas of armed factions Security should be maintained by a special UN peacekeeping mission Unlike the presence in Lebanon which is an observer mission the one in Idlib should have the authority to protect civilians and to search and inspect private property to ensure the rule of law and security In order to ensure neutrality it is important that the countries that donate troops to the force are not involved in the conflict ie they dont have boots on the ground It is also important that they do not have direct interests in Syria This way people can relocate to such zones without fearing arbitrary detention This concept is a type of chartered city under the jurisdiction of the UN Honduras for example has delegated the jurisdiction of a large swath of land in the north of the country to a private entity to create a development zone that will generate prosperity In the case of Syria given the fluidity of the situation and the fact there is no formal state structure that could enter into contracts with a third party the UN represents the most eligible organization to maintain such a zone and contract relevant stakeholders These areas could then be transferred to the Syrian state once a final political settlement that is acceptable to the international community is reached Each zone would be a compounded project held between the UN nongovernmental organizations the private sector and civil society organizations The deescalation zones could prompt a series of local truces that might later lead to a comprehensive peace The UNs peacekeeping forces would be responsible for recruiting and managing locals for policing activities The administration of these areas would be carried out jointly by the elected local councils and appointed personnel Volunteer countries which to repeat do not have a military presence in Syria do not support any armed factions and hence are considered neutral can offer help through area by area agreements For example the state of Kuwait could nominate Kuwait City to help with the administration of Syrias AlAtarib The sister city could appoint members to jointly run the safe zone with the elected city council The deescalation zones could prompt a series of local truces that might later lead to a comprehensive peace Dr Dania Koleilat Khatib In such zones the UN should work with donor organizations as well with civil society and with vetted Syrian businesspeople to create an economic life and generate jobs Reconstruction within the borders of these areas could provide a viable economic zone for Syrian people without breaking the UN principle of no reconstruction before having a political transition Hopefully by increasing the number and scope of the deconfliction zones in Syria the international community will limit the space for conflict It would also offer vital space for the Syrians fleeing violence to thrive Most importantly the zones would offer a graceful exit for the different warring parties that are worn out by the conflict Having a deconfliction zone in Idlib run by the UN would save face for both Turkey and Russia allowing them to avoid a confrontation This would help solve one problem in this long and complicated conflict Dr Dania Koleilat Khatib is a specialist in USArab relations with a focus on lobbying She holds a PhD in politics from the University of Exeter and is an affiliated scholar with the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut

pandemic cuts a wide and deadly swathe through the Middle East and Asia people in wartorn areas are pretty much sitting ducks waiting to contract the infection Nowhere are crisisravaged communities more exposed to the deadly virus than in large expanses of Syria especially in the country is northwest and northeast Northern Syria is particularly vulnerable owing to dire humanitarian conditions and the risk of further conflict analysts told Arab News The northwestern governorate of Idlib and the mostly Kurdishcontrolled northeast the two remaining areas outside the Syrian regime is control now face an invisible enemy Syria confirmed its first case on March 23 after insisting for weeks that the virus had not reached the country The regime had been waging an aggressive military campaign to retake territory in Idlib For the past several weeks fighting has abated especially after Turkey which backs several rebel groups reached a ceasefire deal with Russia Syrian President Bashar Assad is main military backer The hundreds of thousands displaced by the fighting have sought shelter in already overcrowded displacement camps where conditions make it impossible for residents to practice social distancing or selfisolation Out of Idlib is 2 millionplus population at least 900000 were displaced by the latest round of fighting between the regime and rebels A child looks on as volunteers gather in a sewing workshop to make protective facemasks in the northeastern city of Idlib to be used as a means of protection against COVID19 About a million people are displaced living in tents along the Turkish border said Mustafa Gurbuz a nonresident fellow at the Arab Center in Washington DC Social distancing is a luxury There is nothing called home water shortage is pervasive hygiene is impossible and people are already suffering from poor health Under the circumstances if a COVID19 contagion infects only a few people it could spread very quickly Only a few cases could result in an explosive outbreak If the fragile ceasefire derails a renewed conflict may cause more displacement which could lead to further spread of COVID19 Gurbuz said referring to the March truce that brought the fighting in Idlib to a halt The UN has called for a ceasefire across all of Syria so that efforts can be focused on preventing a major outbreak which could affect the lives of millions of people living in deplorable and unsanitary conditions across the country Opinion This section contains relevant reference points placed in Opinion field Aron Lund a fellow with The Century Foundation said Idlib is too disorganized and poorly equipped to handle an epidemic There is no coherent government just a gaggle of militias halfheartedly strung together by a system of councils he said adding that Idlib sorely lacks staff medical facilities and medicine to cope with the likely effects of any significant outbreak Hundreds of thousands of people live cheek by jowl with each other in tent camps and decrepit buildings Old people who are most at risk of dying or falling very ill from the virus are mixed up with children and have no way of isolating themselves for protection Lund said A policeman wearing a mask as a means of protection against the cononavirus Covid19 directs the traffic at an intersection in the northeastern Syrian Kurdishmajority city of Qamishli Furthermore many people in Idlib have no access to clean or hot water or necessities such as soap that can help prevent the spread of the virus To compound the crisis the regime is Russianbacked air campaign in Idlib saw repeated bombing of hospitals and health facilities which has crippled the local health infrastructure and rendered it incapable of handling any outbreak When it comes to a COVID19 outbreak Idlib is fears and vulnerabilities are mirrored by those of northeast Syria most of which is controlled by the Kurdishled Syrian Democratic Forces SDF The news of the first death here in a hospital in the city of Qamishli which is under the regime is authority drew a strong reaction from the Kurdish Red Crescent and the SDFbacked Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria NES on Friday The Red Crescent lamented the high risk of a large spread of the virus due to announcement by the World Health Organization WHO of the positive result after 15 days of the case Syrian Red Crescent vehicles spraying disinfectant along a street in the capital Damascus Joshua Landis director of Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma describes the area as a ticking time bomb for the coronavirus For instance on March 29 Turkey and its armed proxies which occupy part of northeast Syria since launching an invasion last October cut off water supplies to the area by shutting down the Allouk water station on which 460000 people depend If these supplies are indefinitely withheld hundreds of thousands of local inhabitants could fall prey to coronavirus for much the same reason that makes many civilians in northwest Syria vulnerable Tensions are extremely high as six armies are in a standoff The Turkish Army the Syrian Army the SDF the US Army along with Russian and Iranian forces stationed in the region not to mention the many proxy militias which have their own agendas Landis said This makes getting aid to the region or coordinating policy impossible The medical infrastructure in northeast Syria which was at best primitive even before the uprising began in 2011 has been devastated by years of conflict The SDF began to enforce a lockdown on March 23 in an attempt to contain any spread of the virus However it sorely lacks testing kits for detecting COVID19 cases and determining which individuals or areas might have the virus and need to be strictly quarantined The USled antiDaesh coalition has partially addressed the issue through the supply of 12 million worth of medical supplies to help the NES but that is unlikely to be even nearly enough Members of the Syrian Civil Defence White Helmets disinfect a mosque in the city of alBab in the north of Aleppo province on March 24 2020 as part of protective measures against COVID19 coronavirus disease In December Russia and China used their veto power to prevent the UN Security Council from renewing permission for the delivery of aid to northern Syria from neighboring countries in a move denounced as callous by Amnesty International the humanrights advocacy group As a result up to 400000 medical items that would otherwise have been delivered to northeast Syria were left stuck in trucks in neighboring Iraq The Syrian regime likely as part of a bid to pressure the SDF has also prevented the flow of aid through Damascus The WHO says it has provided Syria with at least 1200 testing kits but the NES says Damascus has failed to provide protective equipment and artificial respirators This leaves the NES in a bind and more vulnerable to any outbreak given its heavy reliance on aid from the UN and NGOs especially for the region is displacedpersons camps and overcrowded prisons In the absence of a resumption of the flow of UN aid or unhindered passage of medical supplies through Damascus to NGOs the meager resources of the NES are bound to become overwhelmed quickly in the event of an outbreak A coronavirus contagion in northeast Syria could also pose a very severe security threat to the region and possibly beyond Some 10000 Daesh fighters along with close to 70000 Daesh family members are held in tight quarters where social distancing is impossible said Landis At the very least the situation in northern Syria is a big cause for concern as the pandemic causes havoc throughout the Middle East What is certain is that the pain and suffering of the warweary people of Idlib and northeast Syria are unlikely to end anytime soon

Cooperation Council GCC Summit Manama Bahrain Dec 7 2016 When the UK finally exited the EU in January it accelerated its efforts to enhance the relationships it had already cultivated with other countries and blocs including the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC Since 2016 the GCC and UK have engaged constructively in many areas including political security and economic cooperation at both the bilateral and collective GCC levels most recently on combating the novel coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic However the pace of that partnership needs to be accelerated despite the health challenges Building on historical ties and a robust trading relationship that goes back centuries the GCC and UK are now seeking to establish a free trade area where goods are exchanged with lower tariffs while services and investments are given preferential treatment In December 2016 thenPrime Minister Theresa May met with GCC leaders in Bahrain in the first GCCUK summit May proposed the establishment of a UKGCC Strategic Partnership The summit communique that announced the new partnership stressed the two sides political and security cooperation trade and investment ties and cultural and social engagement It also signaled greater coordination in humanitarian and development assistance programs as well as cooperation on refugees migration and combating human trafficking With the UK leaving the EU it has begun to cultivate new trade agreements When the transition period ends on Dec 31 EU arrangements will no longer provide Britain with market access to other countries and trading blocs and Britain has to find alternatives The GCC is one of the most important markets for British exports and it has the potential to provide greater access when a trade deal is concluded In 2019 GCCUK trade in goods and services exceeded 55 billion while the stock of investments is estimated in the tens of billions The GCC is the third biggest destination for British exports after the EU and the US The UK is negotiating trade deals with the EU and US and is now also exploring one with the GCC When the free trade agreement FTA is concluded it would create a substantial 4 trillion market where goods and services are exchanged with minimum hassle and investors are encouraged to expand their markets Britain has been for some time a favorite destination for GCC investors students and visitors It is estimated that about 1 million GCC visitors go to the UK annually making it their top European destination Much more work is needed but it is encouraging that the two sides already enjoy a strong foothold in each other is market British brands and investments have a solid presence in the GCC region despite stiff competition from other sources About 500000 Britons live in the Gulf half of them in the UAE alone while many more regularly visit the region For this trading partnership to flourish with or without an FTA other aspects of the GCCUK Strategic Partnership need to be bolstered First political dialogue and security coordination need to be more open and regular It is normal for the two sides to have different views on political or regional security issues The 2016 GCCUK summit established multiple channels for dialogue but they need to be utilized more regularly and reliably Second peopletopeople engagement needs to be facilitated more It is still difficult for most GCC nationals to enter Britain to study invest receive medical care or just for tourism UK visas are among the most difficult and expensive to obtain Student and scholar exchanges also need to be facilitated more To increase student exchange GCC students seeking admission to British colleges need more help to match them with the right universities Scholar exchanges are quite limited despite the fact that many professors at GCC universities graduated from prominent British universities Independent artists and writers face greater challenges in moving and working in the two realms Much more work is needed but it is encouraging that the two sides already enjoy a strong foothold in each other is market Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg Third Britain and the GCC need to coordinate more on regional security stabilization and development Both are interested in providing humanitarian and development assistance to countries in need in this region and aid coordination does exist between them albeit at a limited level They also have a common interest in restoring peace and stability in countries in conflict They will benefit from regular consultations on these issues With Brexit finally happening there is now more certainty in Britain after a few years following the 2016 referendum of lingering questions about its relationship with the EU and the rest of the world Despite COVID19 worries now is the time to resume regular joint work between the GCC and UK to put more flesh on the bones of their strategic partnership Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg is the Gulf Cooperation Council is assistant

Turkish officials blamed Kurdish militia the People is Protection Units YPG for the carnage A day earlier Israeli aircraft mounted an attack in Syria at the Mezzeh military airport outside Damascus Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said the assault the latest of several hundred in the past nine years signified the Israeli resolve to push Iran out of Syria Daesh fighters too have initiated attacks on government and Kurdish forces in desert areas in the east of the country On April 9 they attacked regime forces with heavy machine guns mortars and rocketpropelled grenades These attacks were quelled by Russian air assaults The recent incidents took place as various parts of Syria confronted a virulent new threat The coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic On March 23 the government introduced quarantine measures and set up isolation wards for those who become infected while the public has been advised to take precautions to protect themselves By the end of April 40 confirmed cases of infection and three deaths were reported in governmentcontrolled areas The Kurdish northeast reported its first suspected COVID19 death at the end of March but it took nearly three weeks for a laboratory in Damascus to confirm the cause In the northwestern areas surrounding Aleppo where opposing government Kurdish and Turkishbacked Free Syrian Army FSA forces are located sidebyside it is difficult to isolate communities or provide the necessary medical support In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus the FSA has closed routes into regime and Kurdishcontrolled areas Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to unite all proTurkish forces into one army Talmiz Ahmad The principal area of concern is Idlib This town of 3 million people is dominated by radical group Hayat Tahrir AlSham HTS Here Turkish and Syrian government forces the latter supported by Russian aircraft and Iranbacked militants are confronting each other The fighting has displaced nearly a million people who now live in crowded camps According to a report by humanitarian organization Refugees International 80 hospitals have been destroyed by fighting and there is an acute shortage of medical personnel and equipment It is feared a virus outbreak could erupt at any time Turkey remains at the heart of the Idlib conflict Following its March 5 agreement with Russia which created a 6kilometer safe zone in southern Idlib on either side of the M4 highway that stretches from Aleppo to Latakia Turkey has moved about 22000 troops to the area They are deployed at 56 posts and bunkers along the road However despite the agreement with Russia it has taken no action against extremist elements in Idlib According to recent reports Turkey which controls two rebel outfits the FSA and the National Liberation Front NLF has plans to dominate all of northern Syria including Kurdish territories beyond the Euphrates where the USbacked Syrian Democratic Forces are located To achieve this objective Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to unite all proTurkish forces into one army bringing together the FSA the NLF and the extremist HTS This unified force will enable Erdogan to eliminate the Kurds Rojava homeland in northern Syria once and for all and also give Turkey the firepower it needs to retain control of the northern territories against Bashar Assad is forces Erdogan is plans face two obstacles however Firstly the militants in Idlib are divided among themselves and show no enthusiasm for the prospect of joining the Turkish force The HTS which was previously the AlQaedaaffiliated AlNusra Front reinvented itself in 2017 by shedding its ties with AlQaeda and repositioning itself as a mainstream Islamist party It is now estranged from its erstwhile extremist partners in Hurras AlDin and other similar groups which retain their links to AlQaeda The HTS is also divided internally some of its members distrust Turkey and are not in favor of joining the proposed unified force The other problem for Erdogan is Russia as Moscow would like to see a hammer blow directed at the militants in Idlib It also opposes Turkey is plans for a permanent occupation of northern Syria and with Iran is pushing for a united and sovereign Syrian nation under Assad These obstacles have produced Erdogan is usual brinkmanship Taking advantage of the pandemic he has decided to postpone the final deployment of Turkey is new Russianmade S400 missile defense system This is clearly a gambit by the president in an attempt to keep open diplomatic channels with the US that would otherwise be shut down if the system was fully deployed Erdogan perhaps believes that Turkey is interests in Syria are more likely to be backed by the US particularly given his close personal ties with President Donald Trump This perception is encouraging him to move away from his recent partnership with Russia and Iran and perhaps end the Astana peace process Given the serious opposition to his plans from militants and Russia Erdogan is vision of longterm Turkish control over northern Syria is likely to be a pipe dream But it could cause some bitter fighting around Idlib and also involve the Kurds all while the pandemic wreaks havoc among the fighters and the population at large The outlook for Syria remains very grim Talmiz Ahmad is an author and former Indian

Spotlight The Syrian conflict is once again garnering the attention of western and Arab observers sparking nearly the same heated debates that prevailed during 2012 The media has speculated over various political and military scenarios in store for the wartorn country Current and former Syrian officials and economists have once again emerged on the scene to present their credentials Western officials have also expressed their stance and expectations on Syrias future Despite the worlds preoccupation with the coronavirus pandemic Syria has returned to the spotlight due to seven developments 1 Rami Makhlouf For two decades he was the face of Syrias economy and had the final say over its economy However since summer 2019 the tide started to turn against him A campaign has since been launched to dismantle all of his economic institutions and military humanitarian and political networks Makhlouf responded with behavior that goes against Syrian norms He sought defiance through diplomacy and then began making statements and social media videos He refused to accept the governments demand for his Syriatel telecommunications company to pay 185 million dollars in dues What are Russia and Irans positions from all of this What does this mean for the regime And why now Is Makhlouf being backed by some foreign power Is what is taking place in Syria similar to what happens in all civil wars when political change occurs when the warlords seek to legitimize their work Clarification after silence 2 Russian campaign A media campaign from circles close to the Kremlin kicked off shortly after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited Damascus in March when he requested President Bashar Assad to commit to the RussianTurkish agreement on Idlib and brought up Syrias reconstruction Moscow remained silent for several weeks but just days ago it emerged with a countercampaign A Russian military official had toured Damascus recently to stress that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not changed his stance towards Assad The Russian ambassador to Damascus was interviewed by a Syrian newspaper on Thursday during which he said relations between Moscow and Damascus were friendly and strategic dismissing claims of turmoil in relations Has Moscow changed its stance Did it deliberately remain silent over the campaign so that the message could reach Damascus before later retracting it How far will Moscow go Will it simply pressure Assad or have him removed Does Russia really want to become embroiled in Syrias messy economy Has Russias influence in the region hit a wall and does it need a new approach 3 RussianAmerican dialogue American officials have spoken of Moscows desire to resume bilateral dialogue Most notably US envoy James Jeffery told Asharq AlAwsat that his country does not mind for Russia to maintain a military presence in Syria but it does want Iran to leave United Nations envoy Geir Pedersen recently told the Security Council that RussianAmerican dialogue could play a key role encouraging both parties to resume it Diplomats wonder why Moscow would want dialogue at the moment To what extent has its stances changed Can an agreement be reached before the American elections Is Putin really angry with Assad or is this just another of his maneuvers Tactical withdrawal 4 Iranian withdrawal American and Israeli officials have confirmed that Iran was tactically withdrawing from Syria after Israel carried out a series of heavy raids on Iranian positions from Damascus to Aleppo to Deir Ezzour The development coincided with Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and other officials declaration that Tehran was keeping its forces in Syria and they were committed to Dr Bashar Assad as the legitimate president Iran also encouraged factions loyal to it to speed up their return to southern Syria in areas close to the Israelioccupied Golan Heights in what is seen as defiance of the 2018 RussianAmericanJordanianIsraeli agreement to keep nonSyrian forces meaning Iran away from the region Days ago Russia did not hesitate in deploying its troops to force Iranians out of the Daraa countryside Significantly an Iranian official had recently declared that his country had spent some 20 to 30 billion dollars to support Damascus and it now wants that money back What is Iran seeking to achieve from the withdrawal and redeployment Is it related to its economic crisis incurred from the sanctions and coronavirus outbreak or Russian pressure at Israels behest Why has it brought up Damascus financial debt to Tehran Why have Washington and Tel Aviv started to again focus on the Iranian presence 5 Idlib truce Despite the many violations to the Idlib truce in place since March 5 Russia and Turkey continue to respect their commitments and deploy joint patrols One patrol had moved deep into Idlib towards Latakia and Turkey has set up base atop a strategic mountain Despite the tensions between Moscow and Ankara over Libya where each side supports rival forces in the country they are still cooperating in Idlib and the area east of the Euphrates River This raises questions about the fate of the Idlib truce and how sustainable it is How much will the tensions in Libya spill over in Syria What about the extremists in Idlib and when will Russias patience run out Change 6 Syrian elections Parliamentary elections were postponed to July due to the coronavirus outbreak but attention is fixed on the presidential elections set for mid2021 Western officials have spoken of supporting an opposition candidate and the US has again resumed financial support for the opposition Some opposition figures have even declared their candidacy An Israeli researcher even named Tel Avivs preferred candidate for the presidency Pedersen said the elections will be held based on current constitutional arrangements He explained that the UN has not been asked to monitor the polls The envoy said the elections must be held in line with resolution 2254 and that they must be free and transparent They should be held based on the new constitution and under UN supervision he suggested Will the US which is in store for its own presidential elections in November and Russia reach understandings that would allow the Syrian elections to serve as a gateway for change Will they reach understandings on reconstruction sanctions Iranian presence and the political process Will this be the way out for Moscow since it opposes the idea of regime change 7 Sanctions and change The US has again brought up the opening of the AlYarubiyah border crossing between Iraq and the eastern Euphrates region in order to send aid after noticing that Russia had not met its commitments to deliver aid from Damascus in line with an agreement that was reached earlier this year Observers are predicting that Russia and the West will clash over this issue at the Security Council A dispute already exists over sanctions Russia blames American and European sanctions for Damascus inability to tackle the coronavirus and living crises Washington and Brussels retorted by saying that the sanctions have not impeded the delivery of medical or humanitarian aid to Syria Will these issues pave the way for a gradual agreement or will they lead to more division It is not easy to predict where these developments will lead Syria but there is no doubt that they raise many questions that local and foreign parties are trying to analyze to suit their positions while everyone else wallows in uncertainty

sponsored by the UN Yemen envoy British Ambassador to Yemen Michael Aron has said in an exclusive interview with Arab News They should strive to reach a peace agreement that would end the war in Yemen and the worsening humanitarian disaster there he said Everyone will have to compromise to end the war and reach an agreement both of which are in the interests of the people of Yemen he said My P5 colleagues permanent members of the Security Council and I are working hard together to ensure that all parties come with an open mind and willingness to find a solution The British envoy who was appointed ambassador to Yemen in February 2018 said that his government has opposed the Houthi occupation of the Yemeni capital since day one and supported the legitimate government of Yemen in restoring institutions We opposed the Houthi occupation of Sanaa and its attempt to take over the government We support the restoration of the legitimate government of Yemen Despite diplomatic efforts by the UN Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths to convince warring factions in Yemen to come to the negotiation table fighting has surged over the past several months killing hundreds of people and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis Regrettably the situation remains dire Aron said We support the special envoy and all of his efforts to bring the parties closer together We help where we can talking to the parties rallying the international community and as penholders on the Security Council On his countrys contributions to alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen Aron said that the UK had donated 1 billion over the past few years including 160 million through the latest pledging conference Politically he wants to push Yemenis into constructively engaging with the UN peace efforts My job is to support the parties to work together but also highlight where they are not helping access restrictions by the Houthis in the north are a key concern for the UK The UK ambassador hailed Saudi Arabias large donations to Yemen and its role in facilitating the UN brokered peace efforts aimed at ending Yemen war Saudi Arabia is the biggest donor and has shown leadership in this not only with money but by hosting the conference They are committed to a peaceful solution and will continue to provide huge amounts of aid to support the Yemeni people he said Saudi Arabia and the Saudiled coalition have a vital role to play in Yemen Saudi Arabia is working closely with the UN special envoy in support of his peace efforts which they fully support The Saudiled coalition and the internationally recognized government agreed to stop fighting in response to a UN call for a humanitarian truce to fight the coronavirus pandemic The Houthis have escalated military operations on the ground that hampered efforts to stem the spread of the disease he said We regret the fact that despite the Saudi announcement of a unilateral ceasefire the Houthis have continued to pursue their military campaigns We hope that the Houthis will recognize that the UN proposals offer the only way out of the current desperate situation he said The British ambassador advised the government of Yemen GoY and the separatist Southern Transitional Council STC who are engaging in heavy clashes in the southern province of Abyan to put into place the Riyadh Agreement and work with Saudi Arabia to resolve the conflict The focus needs to be on implementing the Riyadh Agreement and the STC coming to Riyadh is very helpful to that end But President Hadi also needs to take decisive steps to implement the Riyadh Agreement The GoY and the STC need to work with Saudi Arabia to resolve their differences he said By implementing it the GoY and STC will be in a situation where they are united in a newly formed government where they both feel they have adequate representation The STC have been demanding a place at the UN talks and the Riyadh Agreement offers them a place at the table as part of the GoY delegation Despite the escalating violence across Yemen and deadly missile and drone attacks by the Iranbacked Houthis on Saudi Arabia Aron believes that there is still an opportunity for a comprehensive agreement to end the war Yes The alternative does not bear thinking about Yemen has already been set back a number of years the coronavirus will not help either The leaders need to do what is best for the people and get an agreement that allows Yemen to build for all its citizens he said Aron urged the Houthis to be more transparent about the coronavirus pandemic and allow local and international health experts to work freely inside areas under their control We understand that the situation is far worse this is from those who want to help and are trying to he said Let experts in to do their jobs grant them the necessary access and take their advice The population has suffered and will suffer further and unnecessarily unless there is cooperation The ambassador concluded the interview by warning that the Safer tanker docked off the Yemeni city of Hodeida would cause an environmental disaster worse than the damage caused by the recent spillage of 20000 tons of fuel in Russias Siberia if the Houthis did not allow experts to resolve the problems there The threat to the environment in the Red Sea is enormous and will impact on all the countries who share this coastline We urgently need to allow UN experts to board the craft assess the condition and take the necessary steps to secure the vessel and prevent the oil from leaking he said It is vital all parties particularly the Houthis cooperate to stabilize the Safer tanker

the most peaceful country in the world However the report also mentioned that almost half of the countries in Europe have deteriorated in peacefulness since 2008 the year the GPI was launched The peace index measures more than just the presence or absence of war It captures the absence of violence or the fear of violence across three domains Safety and Security Ongoing Conflict and Militarization While both the Militarization and Ongoing Conflict markers improved on average in MENA the report noted a deterioration in Safety and Security due to a stronger likelihood of violent demonstrations and increase in political instability Fighters from of the Southern Transitional Council STC gesture following clashes with Saudibacked government forces in the Sheikh Salim area in the

to any one region indicator or country conflict in the Middle East has been the key driver of diminishing peace in the world according to the report Of the 23 indicators in the MENA region 19 are under the average said Serge Stroobants director of operations for Europe and MENA at the IEP Four of the main conflicts of the past years are located in the region Libya Syria Iraq and Yemen According to Dr Theodore Karasik from Gulf State Analytics in Washington DC the numbers are not surprising given the perceptions and realities in the region FASTFACT THE NUMBER 25 decline in average global peacefulness since 2008 The issue here within the GPI scope is the safety and security of people in the region he told Arab News Given the tensions between countries on multiple planes political religious social when combined with various forms of conflict from kinetic to cyber it creates an impact on the peoples in question However the MENA region despite ongoing armed conflict and instability did record improvements in some areas including the number of deaths from internal conflict the intensity of internal conflicts and both the import and export of weapons Fighters loyal to

decrease in the past year This is mostly linked to the number of refugees of internally displaced people IDPs on the territory and some levels of political terror said Stroobants The only other indicator that decreased last year was the number of External and Internal Conflicts Fought so we see the emergence of internal conflict and this is linked with some kind of movement on the political terror scale that created IDPs on Saudi Arabian soil Syria despite its low ranking in the GPI recorded a slight improvement in peacefulness with the civil war and turmoil continuing to lessen in intensity Following the ceasefire deal of March 2020 around 35000 displaced civilians have returned to their homes in Syria is northwestern province of Idlib the report says However millions of

including increased terrorist activity intensification of conflicts in the Middle East rising regional tensions in Eastern Europe and Northeast Asia increasing numbers of refugees and heightened political tensions in Europe and the US This year is edition of the GPI finds that the world has become less peaceful for the ninth time in the last 12 years The crisis provoked by the coronavirus disease COVID19 is also playing a significant role in causing global instability according to the report which notes its potential to undo years of socioeconomic development exacerbate humanitarian crises and aggravate unrest and conflict Its impact is already being seen in worsening USChina relations and civil unrest across the world says the report Displaced Syrians sit in the back of a truck loaded with belongings as they flee along the M4 highway in Ariha in the rebelheld northwestern Syrian province of Idlib on June 8 2020 heading north AFPFile Photo In Karasik is view the pandemic is the most critical driver of instability owing to its effect on interaction commerce and most importantly politics The pandemic when combined with other regional grievances becomes a struggle between methods and approaches he told Arab News In the Middle East the modelling is roughly the same in terms of lockdown testing and treatment The GPI findings may show quite a different picture next year as the region continues to contend with the virus and its lasting impact This complex multidimensional threat to stability requires countries to seek innovative solutions for longterm peace the report said At the institute we developed a concept called the Positive Peace Index PPI which looks at the attitudes institutions and processes that a country needs to put in place in order to create maintain and sustain peace said Stroobants He listed the eight principles of the PPI a wellfunctioning government sound business environment acceptance of rights of others good relations with neighbors high levels of human capital equitable distribution of resources free flow of information and low levels of corruption In this file photo taken on June 22 2018 members of the Kurdistan Workers Party PKK carry rifles as they stand guard on a road in the Qandil Mountains the PKK headquarters in northern Iraq AFPFile Photo When all eight principles are followed by a country said Stroobants it leads to a transformation The GPI report emphasizes that the IEP has empirically derived the PPI through the analysis of almost 25000 economic and social progress indicators to determine which ones have statistically significant relationships with peace as measured by the GPI We also see the economic social governance and ecological benefits that come along and by doing so we create more resilient societies which will be able to better cope with civil unrest natural disasters the effects of climate change and COVID19 said Stroobants Therefore our advice is Invest in positive peace It is an innovative form of development CalineMalek

Democratic hopeful Andrew Yang is presidential campaign As people across the world are being ordered to shelter in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease COVID19 how they will make basic ends meet has become one of the biggest questions facing policymakers Liberal activists are hoping that governments adopting cash transfers as a temporary emergency measure will be compelled to retain it once citizens have seen its benefits As in the rest of the world however the idea of guaranteeing everyone an income both tantalizes and terrifies the Arab region No country in this world is ready for UBI an unconditional payment to all residents without any conditions said Dr Osman Gulseven associate professor at Skyline University College in Sharjah A young boy drives a small vehicle loaded with recyclable items gathered at a landfill to be sold for extra income in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf on June 9 2019 AFPFile Photo This is not only economically infeasible but also financially impossible for most Arab countries Those payments will come from taxes which will again be collected from society specifically the working middle class It is quite illogical to transfer money from the working people to everyone else Although some countries have initiated UBIlike schemes to shore up their COVID19battered economies he does not view it as a potential longterm solution This is an unprecedented crisis period Gulseven told Arab News Typically any money paid by the government has to be financed from somewhere Printing money will cause inflation which has devastating effects on the economy Taxing more from sales and income will further crimp economic activity in his view Opinion This section contains relevant reference points placed in Opinion field It is also impossible to pay back everything without financial resources Gulseven said Arab countries do not have the financial means for UBI Only a few Gulf countries with substantial currency reserves can afford UBI that too only for their citizens Gulseven is view is seconded by George Politis visiting lecturer at the Costas Grammenos Centre for Shipping Trade and Finance who says UBI will not work in periods of financial distress We need normality functioning economies growth and prosperity he said Once normality is achieved the key indicators to study will be GDP per capita public spendingtoGDP ratio and poverty levels in order to calculate how much is needed for a given population and whether the state can afford the cost Palestinians sit by a fire at the Khan Yunis regugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip on January 28 2020 AFPFile Photo Politis said UBI in emerging markets could only work through an international or regional body since states cannot selffinance such a policy The lesson from the EU is that there is little appetite among larger and smaller economies for mutual financial collaboration towards surviving the current crisis he said The International Labor Organization ILO estimated in 2018 that UBI is impact on poverty and inequality depends on such factors as the level of benefits their capacity to meet people is needs and sources of funding FASTFACT 179 GDP cost of UBI if adopted in MENA Source ILO The study found that the cost would range from 179 percent of GDP in the Middle East and North Africa MENA region to about 25 percent of GDP in Asia Europe and Latin America Some UBI proposals have the potential to advance equity and social justice and others do not the ILO report said Governments that consider implementing a UBI should carefully examine all options including the progressive or regressive aspects of the proposed measures the winners and losers and the potential risks and tradeoffs An Iraqi street vendor sells worry beads after measures of social distancing were eased by the authorities ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan in central Baghdad on April 22 2020 AFPFile Photo According to Dr Albadr AlShateri former politics professor at the National Defense College in Abu Dhabi UBI would be an excellent idea for the Arab world but the groundwork has yet to be laid The development of citizenship in the Western context passed through three phases first civil liberties then political participation and finally economic rights he told Arab News The Arab world or any other region for that matter cannot skip stages He said most Arab countries will be hardpressed to implement UBI as such a scheme requires sustainable economic structures something most of them lack Many Arab countries rely on one or two products to maintain their income which are subject to the vagaries of the international market AlShateri said A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency SANA on April 27 2020 shows people gathering at the site of an Israeli air strike south of the Syrian capital Damascus SANA via AFPFile Photo Even if states in the Levant can maintain a sustainable economy UBI would be hard to sustain And if a good segment of the population expects regular income from the government failure to meet that expectation would have dire political consequences AlShateri says the dual shock of wars and the COVID19 pandemic does not bode well for the future of the MENA region Gulf Cooperation Council GCC countries are not in position to extend a helping hand because of the fall of oil prices the economic slowdown and the war in Yemen he said Even before the COVID19 storm hit economic conditions in many Arab countries were precarious at best Emirati men wearing protective masks to combat the spread coronavirus walk in the Mall of Dubai on April 28 2020 after the mall was reopened Lebanon was already on the verge of collapse and Syria was reeling from the aftermath of the civil war which had also damaged the Jordanian economy The Palestinian economy remains heavily dependent on the generosity of foreign donors The Levant region might experience more political conflict as a result of the economic woes AlShateri said Cyril Widdershoven director at Verocy a Dutch consultancy advising on investments energy and infrastructure risks and opportunities in the Arab region concurs with AlShateri is gloomy prognosis Jordan is struggling owing to a lack of reserves desert agriculture and high unemployment he told Arab News If the GCC countries are hit by an economic crisis foreign workers from Egypt Jordan and Lebanon would face unemployment which in turn would affect the budgets of their home countries because of the dependence on Gulf remittances Widdershoven explained Priority should be given in the postcoronavirus era to diversification of economy population growth and sustainable GDP growth Demand for migration will increase as fewer opportunities at home will force young people to look towards the US EU and Australia The potential and most obvious solution for many is International Monetary Fund IMF assistance although it already has applications for support from more than 90 countries says Politis who is also a part of the Faculty of Finance at Cass Business School at the University of London The terms for funding will probably be more relaxed than before After all this is a global humanitarian problem he told Arab News Additionally a number of local foundations and ultrawealthy individuals could support people in need such as refugees and immigrants Some experts expect Levant countries to seek IMF support and use Arab Monetary Fund help for the financing of essential activities There is a very sharp decline from remittances to Levant countries I expect a devaluation in the Jordanian dinar as there are just not enough reserves to keep the exchange rate pegged to the US dollar Gulseven said Poverty and income inequality have always been a significant problem in the region While I think poverty will increase I do not see any mass hunger situation The Levantine area has fertile soil suitable for many kinds of agricultural activities and the region is a major exporter of grain fruit and vegetable Gulseven says the crisis is likely to give a boost to agricultural activities in the Arab region adding that it is essential that enough of this food supply stays within the region As long as we stay in peace together we can withstand these difficult times he told Arab News However standing together means a fair sharing of income and reduced inequality People in the Levant are already questioning the role of the government in society and the hungry and desperate will start taking action because they will think they have nothing to lose Now is not the right time for any kind of internal or regional conflicts so decisionmakers should treat the ensuring of food and social safety for all as a matter of utmost importance

changes in the labor market and education system in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic G20 Short Url LONDON The Civil Society 20 C20 has issued a statement calling on G20 leaders to respond to changes in the labor market and education system in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic The statement highlighted the recent outbreak of COVID19 as well as the bushfires in Australia as examples of how global systems can be challenged leading to Inequality between individuals and countries which the C20 said must be addressed by the G20 states We ask that G20 leaders recognize our new global reality and reorient this year is G20 priorities towards building a more resilient global governance the statement said The statement went on to say governments can learn from previous public health emergencies but global powers need to increase investment into strong international partnerships health care delivery systems and research and development to overcome the challenges of COVID19 On education the statement said immediate action was needed to ensure education for all We implore the G20 Leaders to take immediate action in responding to the substantial impact on education and the dwindling prospects of ensuring access The world is entirely unequipped to maintain a promise of education for all particularly in contexts where classrooms can no longer provide a safe environment for learning it said The Civil Society 20 C20 is one of the eight official Engagement Groups of the G20 It provides a platform of Civil Society Organizations around the world to bring forth a nongovernment and nonbusiness voice Saudi Arabia is the host of the 2020 summit and said on Tuesday it would convene a virtual summit next week bringing together the group is leaders to address the coronavirus pandemic The events of this year alone starting with the bushfires in Australia and moving to the outbreak of COVID19 underscored the evergrowing complexity of our global shared challenges and expose the weaknesses of the current dominant economic system and how it deepens inequalities between individuals and countries We ask that G20 leaders recognize our new global reality and reorient this year is G20 priorities towards building a more resilient global governance G20 leaders need to uphold the principles of human rights civic engagement and democracy As the crisis develops the C20 observes with great alarm the continued deterioration of the situation for many vulnerable groups in different societies Governments must protect and extend medical care to all people without leaving anyone behind The infodemic surrounding the disease is equally fatal to the virus The C20 stands in solidarity with communities suffering as a result of different governments lack of transparency Governments are accountable in their response to the crisis and work on empowering local communities and civil society actors in responding to the outbreak We can learn from previous public health emergencies the importance of quality care continuum protection of human rights antidiscrimination and isolation of people living with the diseases and affected communities COVID19 is a sobering reminder that we need to increase investment in what we know works strong international partnerships building health care delivery systems that reach everyone research and development and an approach to care that prioritizes the most marginalized The C20 urges that G20 leaders consider the recommendations in the statement on pandemic preparedness released jointly with the Business 20 Labor 20 Think 20 Women 20 and Youth 20 Another emerging lesson out of this emergency is that hyperglobalization of our supply chains is making our trade systems extremely vulnerable to shocks The C20 cautions G20 leaders against the ongoing attempts in trade agreement negotiations to open health markets to foreign investors and competition turning health systems into yet another investment opportunity We worry that the divide between those who can afford healthcare and those who cannot will be exacerbated The C20 warns that inequalities will ensue as a consequence of the outbreak Labor policies need to be put in place to address the needs of the most vulnerable who cannot afford to sit at home and prepare for the expected rise in working poverty especially in countries with a high informal economy where women are overrepresented The world is in need of multilateral coordination of an effective response to the economic crisis that provides adequate fiscal and monetary stimulus while safeguarding liquidity from misuse by speculative activities A fairly designed stimulus package should take into account not only the interest of businesses and SMEs but also households workers and the most vulnerable A problem with multiple dimensions requires a solution by multiple actors Members of Civil Society and humanitarian NGOs continue to face tightened financial restrictions due to risk and cost aversion by banks in complying with FATF regulations Such financial exclusion limits our ability to respond to global emergencies We implore the G20 Leaders to take immediate action in responding to the substantial impact on education and the dwindling prospects of ensuring access The world is entirely unequipped to maintain a promise of education for all particularly in contexts where classrooms can no longer provide a safe environment for learning The C20 calls on G20 leaders to expand this year is G20 priorities to vigilantly respond to the changes in the labor market through expanding social protection systems ensure digital and eLearning is accessible across prioritize child online safety address rising risks to debt sustainability in emerging markets as they face urgent financing needs to improve health systems capacity to respond to the COVID19 outbreak including debt relief and attending to their exposure to volatile capital flows

exacting a heavy human toll While the virus punishes all regardless of status wealth race and creed it is almost programmed to hit the weakest and the poorest most As in other parts of the world the pandemic has forced Gulf Cooperation Council member states to throw all their resources at slowing the spread of the virus and take care of the infected Before the coronavirus storm hit these governments were seeking for a variety of reasons to boost the share of women in the workforce across both the public and private sectors Now according to World Health Organization WHO estimates 70 percent of global coronavirus frontline workers are women Women are the caregivers and so women are bearing the brunt of the adverse effects of the COVID19 pandemic said Rasha Alturki CEO of Riyadhbased Alnahda Society for Women which has provided assistance since 1962 to women who are at risk or belong to socioeconomically disadvantaged households Women are still the caregivers and we

publichealth challenges since its founding Aloula has managed to help 4000 people and more than 1000 families in need Women are by nature caregivers so this period of upheaval and distress has

being experienced by women all too well being the owner of an eponymous fashion brand in Lebanon a country that is facing a trifecta of challenges A coronavirus outbreak on top of an economic meltdown and political instability since October last year Serafi said she is providing meals for 100 families in Lebanon during the coronavirus crisis We want to give a sense of hope and positivity during this period to everyone in need she told Arab News The Saudi ADHD Society chaired by Princess Nouf bint Mohammed bin Abdullah AlSaud has tailored its ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder programs for online platforms in light of the current situation The organization has created a specialized lecture series focused on different ways young men and women with ADHD can deal with the current situation We have provided close to 100 free online counseling sessions said Serafi adding that the society has been receiving many calls for help Female staff at Alnahda faced a similar situation during the initial weeks of the lockdowns Our social workers were getting calls at 11 pm and throughout the night said Alturki Women are struggling with marital and sleep problems legal and rent problems loss of income challenges accessing food and water and home schooling their children Alturki said the socioeconomic impact of the coronavirus crisis cannot be overstated Imagine if you had to take care of four children and elderly parents and also a husband at home who is out of work she added It is a lot of pressure for these women Alturki said all three activities in which Alnahda specializes grassroots assistance research and fieldwork and advocacy are key to understanding how the situation is affecting women In addition the organization has overseen the distribution of more than 600 laptops among children in need and connected women in need of masks sanitizers and financial assistance with charities In Alkhobar Saudi Arabia social services of a similar nature are being provided by Fatat Alkhaleej a charity founded in 1968 We have sourced and distributed protective baskets among beneficiaries of our programs said Ebtisam Abdullah AlJubair CEO of Fatat Alkhaleej We

the start of Ramadan a month of fasting prayer reflection and community nonprofit organizations and charities usually ramp up their activities across Saudi Arabia This year the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak has posed an unexpected and unprecedented challenge to organizations such as Fatat Alkhaleej Aloula and Alnahda But if their track record is any indication they have proved up to the task from providing assistance to the elderly and arranging for groceries to be delivered to lending psychological support While it is hard to stop the spread of coronavirus it will happen one day Serafi said One thing that will never stop is the art of giving sharing love and support to those in need

a result of the coronavirus disease COVID19 and the media focused on the economic and social effects of the pandemic the Rohingya continue to suffer under a ruthless regime in their homeland Myanmar and in cramped refugee camps in Bangladesh The coronavirus simply added to their existing misery Even the risky prospect of attempting to escape on treacherous rough seas in search of a better life is no longer an option In a statement to the 44th session of the Human Rights Council last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights UNHCHR Michelle Bachelet said The Rohingya refugee crisis has effectively become protracted with no solution in sight The human rights situation the Rohingya are facing in Rakhine State Myanmar has not improved and the conditions required for their safe dignified and sustainable return home from Bangladesh are not in place she added In addition restrictions placed on humanitarian access and freedom of movement as a result of the pandemic have exacerbated the situation Hundreds of people have attempted to escape to other nations in rickety boats only to be turned away by authorities in destination countries out of fear that the refugees might spread the coronavirus leaving them stranded at sea for months In the squalid refugee camps at Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh meanwhile the threat posed by the virus is increased by the unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions Social distancing is almost impossible Families live at close quarters in flimsy bamboo shacks They have to use communal toilets and water facilities that are not always clean or available Even the most basic items such as soap are scarce In other words the Rohingya are doomed wherever they go While the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is working in the camps to protect people from COVID19 and treat the infected an internet ban imposed by the Bangladeshi government for security reasons has added to the distress of refugees It has left them cut off from the outside world with no access to news or reliable information about the pandemic As a result rumors spread quickly The rising number of confirmed cases is putting growing pressure on the UN refugee agencys ability to provide enough equipment and isolation facilities medication food and water and to conduct medical tests It is running out of funding and human resources Meanwhile Bangladeshi authorities intercepted a boat carrying hundreds of refugees and escorted it to a remote island apparently in an effort to reduce the risk of them spreading the virus in Coxs Bazar Bangladesh is doing what it can with limited resources to help the refugees However it is struggling to cope with high numbers of coronavirus cases across the country and the loss of many healthcare workers In Rakhine State where the majority of Rohingya live they continue to bear the brunt of an intensifying armed conflict between the military called the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army an insurgent group that supports efforts by Rakhine Buddhists to seek greater selfgovernance and wider development The government considers it a terrorist group During a socalled clearance operation launched by the Tatmadaw residents were told to leave their homes and that anybody left behind would be considered Arakan Army Tens of thousands fled as a result of the heavy fighting According to the UNHCHR a pattern has emerged of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law including airstrikes on and shelling of civilian areas and the destruction and burning of villages Last month the Tatmadaw reportedly burned large areas of Buthidaung township About 700000 Rohingya were forced to flee from the area to Bangladesh in 2017 following a brutal crackdown by the military which the UN said was carried out with genocidal intent Eyewitness accounts and satellite images suggest dozens of Rohingya villages were burned to the ground The importance of this lies not only in the fact that these villages contained homes to which Rohingya refugees hoped they might one day return They also contained evidence of what transpired in 2017 Five months before they were burned down in fact the International Court of Justice ICJ issued an order prohibiting the destruction of evidence supporting allegations of genocide In 2019 The Gambia took up the Rohingya case on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation OIC The African nation brought the genocide allegations to the ICJ and sought provisional measures to end the killings protect and preserve evidence and punish those responsible On Jan 23 this year the ICJ announced a landmark decision on those provisional measures Unanimously endorsed by all 17 judges the binding ruling ordered Myanmar to take prompt action to prevent further abuses and violations of the human rights of the Rohingya people prevent the destruction of or damage to evidence related to the case and report regularly to the ICJ on the action being taken to ensure these orders are followed Myanmar continues to strongly deny any genocidal intent while refusing to cooperate with UN special rapporteur on Myanmar or comply with the ICJ orders The root causes of the violations and abuses endured by the Rohingya in Myanmar have not gone away These include the discrimination and exclusion enshrined in the laws and policies of the government such as the revocation of citizenship rights in 1982 which rendered them stateless and restricted their access to basic human rights services and free movement There must be a way for the international community to help resolve this crisis and other cases involving blatant violations of international law and human rights Maha Akeel A 2017 resolution by the UNs Human Rights Council called for a comprehensive solution to the Rohingya crisis within three years Two and a half years later their situation is as bad as it was if not worse There must be a way for the international community to help resolve this crisis and other cases involving blatant violations of international law and human rights otherwise the credibility and standards of international organizations are in doubt But then we

Turkey to help the country combat the coronavirus outbreak AP Photo The coronavirus crisis has not only caused great changes to our lives on a personal level it has also transformed the tools of diplomacy at state level In recent years medical diplomacy has become a significant softpower tool adopted by nations in an attempt to garner symbolic influence and prestige The emergence of the novel coronavirus has created an opportunity for some states to engage in pandemic diplomacy with countries that lack the resources required to battle the virus Turkey like many countries has been sending medical aid to other countries in a show of solidarity as part of a collaborative approach to overcoming the pandemic In times of crisis any signs of goodwill between countries that are normally at odds are symbolically significant gestures because such times offer a great opportunity to extend olive branches Last week for example the news that Turkey is sending medical equipment to Armenia and Israel two countries with which Ankara has been locked in a diplomatic standoff for years grabbed significantly more attention than the similar assistance it is sending to other countries This raised hopes that the aid might help to break the ice and lead to better relations Unfortunately politics quickly intervened The Armenian situation began when in a recent TV interview presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said that Turkey had received a request for medical assistance from the authorities in Yerevan President Recep Tayyip Erdogan approved the request he added and the Turkish Health Ministry was tasked with coordinating the aid process The Armenian government however denied asking Ankara to send medical supplies and added that such an appeal for help was not on their agenda Given these mixed messages I asked Richard Giragosian the director of the Yerevanbased Regional Studies Center what the diplomatic atmosphere is like in Armenia He noted that humanitarian gestures such as the offer of medical assistance during a pandemic are symbolically important and generate a degree of fresh optimism that an opportunity might exist for diplomatic reengagement in this time of crisis However he added that problematic lines of communications between the two nations had created a serious misunderstanding Official communication between Armenia and Turkey has always been difficult and most often devolves into a war of words with competing statements countering different interpretations he said Most recently this difficulty in diplomatic communications has resumed over the issue of aid to Armenia during the COVID19 crisis The Armenian Foreign Ministry said its officials contacted the Turkish authorities with the sole aim of arranging the repatriation of Armenian citizens in Turkey and added that any potential TurkishArmenian cooperation would be significantly limited Erdogan and the Armenian patriarch Archbishop Sahak Mashalian discussed the matter of Armenian citizens in Turkey during a telephone conversation on April 8 The following day 73 Armenians were taken to their home country on buses that traveled via Georgia because the border between Turkey and Armenia is closed During the call Erdogan also expressed a willingness to provide assistance to Armenia in the form of medical aid Adding to the controversy Turkey also asked Beijing for clarification about aid packages sent to Armenia that included a reference to Mount Ararat which Turkey refers to as Agri Mountain It is located in the Turkish province of Agri but the Armenians consider it an important national symbol The Chinese said that the aid was prepared by a local authority and the Ararat reference was added later As a journalist who has covered Turkey is relationship with Armenia and participated in projects between 2012 and 2015 that aimed to normalize relations I believe there is an ongoing optimism and desire on both sides for the development of bilateral ties However this is often held hostage by domestic political dynamics in both countries Given the difficult history of the relationship between the nations this minor yet pleasing example of cooperation to arrange the repatriation of Armenian citizens is significant It is worth noting that it came less than two weeks before April 24 which marks the 105th anniversary of the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottomans Therefore whether a request for assistance was made or not Yerevan would not favor any publicity about such a thing at such a sensitive time In times of crisis any signs of goodwill between countries that are normally at odds are symbolically significant gestures because such times offer a great opportunity to extend olive branches Sinem Cengiz Giragosian describes the complicated coronavirusrelated situation between Turkey and Armenia as not only a missed opportunity but also a case of miscommunication marked by a case of the nations taking two steps forward and one step back A similar controversy arose on April 9 when Bloomberg reported that medical equipment was being sent from Turkey to Israel and a similar shipment was expected to be sent to the Palestinian territories It added that three Israeli aircraft were due to land at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey to pick the cargo According to the report Ankara approved the shipment of medical equipment to Israel for humanitarian reasons in return for the Israelis allowing similar aid to be sent to the Palestinians However the Israeli media reported the supplies were purchased by private organizations not the state and that the deal was purely commercial not a humanitarian gesture In an article about the controversy published by media site AlMonitor an Israeli journalist wrote that the Israeli side might be reluctant to credit Erdogan with battling the virus that causes COVID19 It continued With the deterioration of bilateral ties over the past decade Israeli diplomats consider every step forward as small as it may be as extremely fragile and sensitive For Jerusalem the less publicity the better Whatever was going on behind the scenes it is clear that in both cases communication problems overshadowed any steps toward Turkey is reconciliation with Armenia and Israel Sinem Cengiz is a Turkish political analyst who specializes in Turkey is relations with the Middle East Twitter SinemCngz

with threats from distraught families who feel the hospital is not doing enough One of Saleh is heroes Dr Jawad Norzai is relentless in his devotion to the patients he said Along with his job as chief surgeon Norzai visits over 60 patients a day and finds the time to train new doctors Saleh said The 32yearold Norzai got his medical diploma in 2013 and worked first for private hospitals joining the

luckily they also recovered Another one of the AfghanJapan doctors who recovered from the virus is Mozhgan Nazehad 35 I spent three nights awake because of severe pain back pain and lower limb pain that pain I will never forget said Nazehad who lives apart from her family to keep them safe The other hospital that treats COVID19 patients is the Ali Jenah funded by Pakistan a 200bed but lessequipped facility also in western Kabul There is also an isolation center in the dormitory of the Kabul University but it does not provide treatment According to the Health Ministry more than 1700 medical workers including 40 at the AfghanJapan hospital were infected while providing care to COVID19 patients 26 have died Afghanistan has so far recorded almost 35000 cases of the virus including 1094 deaths with the number of infections thought to far outnumber the official tally The International Rescue Committee warned last month that Afghanistan is on the brink of a humanitarian disaster because the government is unable to test some 80 of possible coronavirus cases The Health Ministry said it now has the capacity to test only 2500 people per day Last month 10000 to 20000 people were coming daily asking to be tested but the government had to turn many down Afghanistan has one doctor for every 3500 people less than a fifth of the global average according to the World Health Organization The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday that in addition to the COVID19 health crisis faced in Afghanistan the socioeconomic impact of the virus could become catastrophic with 124 million people one third of the countrys population already considered to be living at emergency levels of food shortages Seemingly indicative of the fractured health care system

Bazaar in Tehran Cases of people being infected with the coronavirus disease COVID19 reportedly began emerging in Iran in midFebruary The virus spread rapidly across the country and the Islamic Republic became the epicenter of the region is outbreak in early March Instead of concentrating on charting a path and assisting the international community in addressing this grave public health crisis Tehran and its agents appear to be spending their political and financial capital on spreading disinformation and propaganda One of the fake news stories that proIran operatives have been propagating is linked to the narrative that the virus was deliberately created by another government For example when the reports of coronavirus first appeared in Iran a proTehran influencing operation known as the International Union of Virtual Media IUVM began a social media disinformation campaign It suggested that the US government created the virus in order to advance and maintain its global hegemony according to a new report by social media analyst Graphika The report describes the character of IUVM as a prolific operator that is centered on websites rather than social media Its longrunning practice has been to create or copy webbased content that amplifies Iranian government narratives then post it to social media accounts that pose as independent news outlets or journalists The Iranian regime has become masterful at taking advantage of important events in order to incite antagonism toward its rivals including the West and Gulf states In this case the objective of the disinformation campaign was most likely to incite antiAmericanism and hatred toward the US allies during these uncertain times Graphika pointed out that through its posts on social media the IUVM argued that it is no coincidence that the virus selectively goes to countries that are considered enemies of the United States namely China Iran some EU countries including Italy It is unrealistic to say that the US or any other government would deliberately create this virus in order to advance its national interests It is worth noting that America has overtaken Italy to have the world is highest COVID19 death toll with more than 800000 confirmed cases and about 50000 fatalities The coronavirusrelated economic slowdown in the US has also seen the unemployment rate reach 13 percent its highest level since the Great Depression of the early 1930s And the US equities market has lost trillions of dollars in value while some economists believe that the longterm negative impact of the virus on the US economy could be even greater Iran is covert disinformation operations concerning COVID19 are not only inciting hatred toward other countries but are also most likely negatively impacting the international community is efforts to fight the virus The US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia Laura Cooper stressed in an April 13 statement These are messages that are endangering global health because they are undermining the efforts of governments of health agencies and of organizations that are in charge of disseminating accurate information about the virus to the public This is not the first time the Iranian regime is disinformation operations have been detected In August 2018 a cybersecurity firm FireEye revealed data about Iran is widespread misinformation campaigns Following the report the giant social media platforms took action and removed hundreds of accounts reportedly linked to the Iranian government Facebook removed 652 pages groups and accounts for coordinated inauthentic behavior that originated in Iran and targeted people across multiple internet services Other popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Google owner Alphabet have also identified and removed many inauthentic accounts that originated in Iran The Iranian regime has become masterful at taking advantage of important events in order to incite antagonism toward its rivals Dr Majid Rafizadeh These accounts were promoting specific narratives that advanced the regime is interests such as arguing that Iran is militaristic engagements in Syria Iraq and Yemen are for humanitarian purposes that the Islamic Republic enjoys legitimacy domestically and regionally that some of the Gulf states should be treated as enemies and that Iran is nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes However whenever social media accounts or websites linked to the Iranian regime is disinformation campaigns are exposed and removed the Islamic Republic is able to find other outlets or create new accounts to continue spreading its propaganda By using the latest technology and employing various methods such as generating and disseminating fabricated headlines and videos and propagating fake news and inaccurate pictures the regime is able to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations During these critical times it is incumbent on the international community and powerful social media outlets to prevent the Iranian regime and its operatives from spreading disinformation and disseminating fake news concerning the coronavirus Dr Majid Rafizadeh is

2020 in Istanbul after Turkish authorities imposed a twoday curfew to prevent the spread of the epidemic COVID19 caused by the novel coronavirus A baker prepares bread in his bakary to be delivered in his neighborhood on April 11 2020 in Istanbul after Turkish authorities imposed a twoday curfew to prevent the spread of the epidemic COVID19 caused by the novel coronavirus Short Url The coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic is ravaging the world but still genuine cooperation could not be carried out among nations In Turkey this lack of cooperation manifested itself in a different form Ordinary people did their best to help each other the solidarity among individuals was perfect The youths of every neighborhood organized among themselves to help the elderly meet their basic needs But while people were performing so well unnecessary greed between the central authorities and a few municipalities spoiled the atmosphere The metropolitan municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara undertook an initiative to raise funds to help the needy including workers who lost their job as a result of the pandemic They opened a bank account and invited the public to deposit money which would be distributed to those in need A lot of money had accumulated in the bank account as early as the evening of the first day The day after this initiative was launched the government announced that such municipality campaigns were illegal It blocked the bank account opened by the Istanbul council saying that the provincial governor is authorization had to be obtained for such an action and instead launched its own campaign to raise money for the same purpose The case is now being brought to court The Istanbul municipality claims that the government blocked the bank account because it does not want to see the city which is run by the main opposition Republican People is Party CHP be successful in the eyes of the electorate The court will now decide whether the government is initiative was politically motivated The government took similar action with the distribution of protective face masks It announced that large quantities would be manufactured and made available at a reasonable price When the municipalities of some major cities started to distribute such masks free of charge the government stepped in and announced that it would offer the same service Even the delivery would be free So this time the competition between the central government and local administrations served a useful purpose as the people were able to acquire free face masks Semiha Oyus a Member of Parliament from the ruling Justice and Development Party AKP brought her own contribution to this row by claiming that eating the food distributed by the oppositioncontrolled Aydin municipality was religiously forbidden haram No government in living memory has banned the practice of distributing food to the poor Yasar Yakis Last week another municipality Eskisehir published an announcement asking benefactors to stop contributing to the bank account it was using to finance the distribution of meals to needy people and students The reason was again the blocking of the account by the government The practice of distributing food to the poor is a deeply rooted tradition that goes back centuries in Turkish culture No government in living memory has banned such a useful humanitarian action The mayor of Eskisehir Yilmaz Buyukersen has been very successful He has been elected five consecutive times and has been in the position for more than 20 years This interference from the central authorities is nothing more than an attempt to interfere with the performance of another successful mayor from the CHP This attitude of the central government is in stark contrast to what the AKP was doing in its early years in power One of the first major laws that it passed in the early 2000s saw it devolve much authority to the local administrations President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was at that time a strong supporter of such moves He promoted the idea that the local administrations were closer to the people than the central authorities and therefore they had to exercise more power Erdogan had served in the mid1990s as the mayor of Istanbul and he suffered a lot from the slowness of the decisionmaking process of the central authorities on matters pertaining to the municipalities He complained that he could not implement many proposed projects because of the obstruction of central government Decentralization is also a major rule within the EU which Turkey has aspirations of joining The principle of subsidiarity means that Brussels should not take action in an area unless it is more effective than action taken at the national or local level So Erdogan is desire to devolve competences to the municipalities was also in line with EU rules However after the AKP became stronger it changed its approach and distanced itself from the principle of decentralization It started to curtail the power of the local authorities After the last mayoral elections of May 2019 the government removed many elected mayors from their posts and substituted them with bureaucrats This is the application of the famous rule in social sciences that says Now that we have climbed up let us remove the ladder Yasar Yakis is a former foreign minister of Turkey and founding member of the ruling AK

coronavirus A few tested positive Then between June 24 and 30 the countrys confirmed cases shot from 11 to 81 Now the Indian Ocean nation has delayed reopening for commercial flights for its lucrative tourism industry until Aug 1 if all goes well African nations face a difficult choice as infections are rapidly rising Welcome the international flights that originally brought COVID19 to the illprepared continent or further hurt their economies and restrict a lifeline for badly needed humanitarian aid This is a very important moment the World Health Organizations Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti told reporters on Thursday a day after Egypt reopened its airports for the first time in more than three months Other countries are preparing to follow Thats even as Africa had more than 463000 confirmed virus cases as of Sunday and South Africa its most developed economy already struggles to care for COVID19 patients But Africa is economies are sick too its officials say The continent faces its first recession in a quartercentury and has lost nearly 55 billion in the travel and tourism sectors in the past three months the African Union says Airlines alone have lost about 8 billion and some might not survive Most of Africas 54 countries closed their airspace to ward off the pandemic That bought time to prepare but it also hurt efforts to deliver lifesaving medical supplies such as vaccines against other diseases Shipments of personal protective gear and coronavirus testing materials both in short supply have been delayed Many governments have decided travel needs to resume the WHO is Africa chief said Africa has seen far fewer flights than other regions during the pandemic Sometimes the entire West and Central African region saw just a single daily departure according to International Civil Aviation Organization data While Asia Europe and North America averaged several hundred departures a day from international airports the African continent averaged a couple or few score daily Last week the number of global flights jumped significantly In the threeday period between June 30 and July 2 the daily number of departures increased from 3960 to 6508 as countries

services for cargo and repatriation flights in the past few months it now wants to play a leading role in the new normal That means face masks are mandatory on board But the WHOs Africa chief hopes to see all airlines do more Physical distancing should be encouraged by leaving seats vacant Moeti said And she suggested that when we see a flareup that is unacceptable in virus cases the loosening of travel restrictions could be reversed The WHO recommends that countries look at whether the need to fight widespread virus transmission outweighs the economic benefits of opening borders It is also crucial to determine whether the health system can cope with a spike in imported cases it says Regional leaders of the International Air Transport Association and Airports Council International are ready to go In an open letter to African ministers last month they welcomed global guidelines developed by the ICAO for the return to travel after the aviation industrys biggest challenge of its history They also urged African countries to identify every opportunity where travel restrictions could be lifted as soon as the epidemiological situation allows for it As the continent slowly takes flight some European nations and others are limiting entry to people from countries they feel are doing a good job of containing the virus African nations can seize the moment and do more tourism at

country have the virus On March 18 Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport was closed The country currently has 168 cases of which there have been four deaths according to the Health Ministry Until they closed it we were receiving voice notes from people at the airport that Iranian flights were still coming into the country Marian Wehbe who runs her own PR agency told Arab News It is the citizens who have been responsible for trying to contain coronavirus The citizens not the government have ensured that everyone stays home for their safety Palestinian and Lebanese women is groups are spreading awareness about women is rights and helping those living in difficult conditions during the crisis Supplied Due to the virus everything is now closed in Lebanon except supermarkets pharmacies and hospitals Last week when I came to the hospital I did not know if Id live or die said Nadine Sfeir 43 who was diagnosed with COVID19 last week after returning from a ski trip to Courchevel France She is currently in quarantine in Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut I had some chills a low temperature and a stuffy nose she said of the symptoms I went to do the test on March 8 and it was positive My husband is still negative but my mother who is 68 has it She saw me before I was diagnosed but has mild symptoms Sfeir said all COVID19 patients are locked in their rooms and have to undergo two tests with negative results before they can leave the hospital Testing for the virus is a problem in Lebanon if you want to do so privately At 150000 Lebanese pounds 100 a COVID19 test is expensive The government provides free testing at hospitals only if you have symptoms Imagine what a family of five who cannot make ends meet would have to do in order to get the entire family tested said Basel Dalloul founder of the Dalloul Art Foundation in Beirut I doubt any of the numbers in Lebanon no matter where you get them from are reflective of the true situation on the ground A Lebanese healthcare professional said on condition of anonymity Countries are melting down because of corona but we in Lebanon melted down before corona Our government is bankrupt our equipment and our resources are scarce The way to address this crisis is for the Lebanese people to stick together and for the private and public sectors to work jointly to contain the virus There have been reported talks about transforming some hotels into quarantine facilities for people suspected of having COVID19 There is no way to stop the virus said the health care professional The better we are at flattening the curve by having people socially isolate the more successful we will be at diminishing the damage of the virus Dalloul said in the absence of accurate data Lebanese are petrified The small Mediterranean country which has a population of approximately 68 million is also home to the highest number of refugees per capita in the world There are 15 million Syrian refugees alone and according to a census held by the Lebanese Palestinian Dialogue Committee in 2018 there are around 175000 Palestinian refugees So in Lebanon there is one refugee for every four citizens According to the World Bank roughly a third of Lebanese live in poverty up 274 percent from 201112 The UN Development Programme estimates that roughly a third of Lebanese live on less than 4 per day How are grassroots organizations helping the destitute and refugees against COVID19 We are still welcoming women to benefit from our services via online calls if a woman wants to talk Zahra Dirani media coordinator at the Lebanese Women is Democratic Gathering RDFL told Arab News We have closed our doors for the time being but if there is an emergency case now we can meet the woman and decide on an action plan for when businesses open again Palestinian and Lebanese women is groups are spreading awareness about women is rights and helping those living in difficult conditions during the crisis Supplied Founded in 1976 the RDFL is a feminist secular nongovernmental organization advocating for and raising awareness about women is rights in Lebanon There is a plan to make group calls among the social workers to support women in need but it is unsure how well this will work given the weak wifi in the country It is a challenge but we are still working said Dirani In my village located in the Bekaa Valley it was recently decided that Syrian refugees cannot leave their camps from 6 pm to 6 am because of coronavirus Olfat Mahmoud is a Palestinian refugee and cofounder of the Palestinian Women is Humanitarian Organization PWHO established in 1993 to support Palestinian and Syrian women and their families who live in refugee camps in Lebanon Mahmoud also works in the Bourj ElBarajneh camp where there are both Palestinian and Syrian refugees The problem is that the camps are overcrowded she said Bourj ElBarajneh is 1 sq km in size and holds more than 50000 refugees We have been doing awareness sessions in the camp on how to protect against COVID19 We send them leaflets and communicate through the mosque so that everyone can hear from home about proper hygiene something the women implement Mahmoud said Until now we have no cases but if one person gets infected it means that 50000 will get infected The shutdown of the country is galvanizing civil society Palestinian refugees barred from working in Lebanon and who normally do work in construction and as cleaners have no money to buy food until the lockdown ends Neighbors now share food and through the PWHO we are providing as much food as we can now said Mahmoud Wehbe said We are in a state of crisis and we need these organizations more than ever We need constant actions of solidarity

returning from Iran at Najaf International Airport last month Medical staff in protective gears distribute information sheets to Iraqi passengers returning from Iran at Najaf International Airport last month Short Url As if losing their most famous general and facing the prospect of unending US sanctions was not enough there is now another thing for the embattled authoritarians of Tehran to worry about It is not the CIA MI6 or Mossad Delta Force or the SAS it is the coronavirus disease COVID19 The virus may well end up fundamentally changing everyone is political expectations but it is going to have a massive impact on the fragile political ecosystems of large parts of the Middle East and North Africa Iran has had the worst of it so far After a long period of denial the health minister announced on March 19 that people were dying due to the virus at a rate of one every 10 minutes and this was accelerating As of Sunday the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reports more than 55000 confirmed cases and some 3400 deaths in Iran the sixthhighest number of fatalities in the world And that is just the official figures which many Iranian doctors privately claim are a vast underestimate Several ministers senior politicians and others close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have succumbed The heart of the epidemic seems to have been the shrine and pilgrimage city of Qom which is central to Iran is production of clerical knowledge and power and therefore to the regime is legitimacy About 20 million Iranians and 25 million foreigners visit every year with many of the latter including several thousand Chinese studying in densely packed seminaries The regime has long seen China as a counterbalance to Western particularly US pressure It has ignored the Chinese persecution of Uighur Muslims and has gone to great lengths to develop air and rail connections between the two countries Unusually the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGCcontrolled Mahan Air kept flying into China well after Beijing had acknowledged the seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan and other transport links were being closed down The flights may have brought back not just contraband but also the virus which 16 other countries claim Iran then passed on to them The regime denied that it had taken hold until too late It encouraged people to celebrate Victory Day on Feb 11 and turn out to vote in the parliamentary elections as a sign of popular confidence in the regime they did not It hesitated to quarantine Qom And only at the last minute did it warn against large gatherings for Nowruz the Persian New Year in late March This comes on top of the shooting down by Iranian air defenses in January of a civilian airliner taking off from Tehran airport and the brutal suppression of popular protests last autumn both of which were met by a similar campaign of denial and obfuscation What happens in Iran very quickly spreads to Iraq That was once an advantage for Tehran It used its religious and cultural links with the Shiites of Iraq to embed its influence virally in the post2003 political landscape But real pathogens know no political allegiance And as in Iran the official Iraqi figures for infections and deaths are probably a huge underestimate The Iraqi governing class is in turmoil as it seeks to manage sustained popular anger while protecting its own privileges One prime minister has resigned The candidate initially nominated as a replacement failed to attract enough support A second is also struggling The government as a whole which has never been much good at providing public goods is in no fit state to provide effective leadership The longterm problem for Iran as for everyone in the region is that the money simply is not there anymore Sir John Jenkins Iran has better medical provision than Iraq but that is not saying much To judge from social media both systems seem to be in a state of collapse offering an opportunity for the IRGC and Shiite militias as in Lebanon to fill the vacuum in order to expand their social control Health professionals in both countries are committed and skilled but politics violence and corruption get in the way And no one trusts official announcements Tehran at first denied that the threat was serious blamed outsiders for exaggerating the impact and then suggested the US or Israel or both had deliberately spread the virus a lie Khamenei is still repeating They waited for weeks to shut religious shrines and still have problems getting people not to visit them The IRGC has posed as defenders of the people against the virus but they have also threatened with reprisals doctors who dispute the official statistics The longterm problem for Iran as for everyone in the region is that the money simply is not there anymore Energy prices were already under pressure and Iran is energy sector has been savagely hit by US sanctions But with oil at or under 30 a barrel and global demand tanking the International Monetary Fund IMF thinks the budgets of all energyproducing states in the region are in trouble Those in Iraq and Iran are in danger of implosion The current Iraqi budget assumes an average oil price this year of 56 a barrel Even at that level revenues more or less equal current expenditure twothirds of it spent on wages and pensions and much of the rest mortgaged to the international companies that actually extract the oil They have now been asked to scale back production and accept deferred terms in turn they are beginning to lay off workers and put pressure on their own suppliers There is no spare government cash for investment and no significant private sector to create meaningful jobs for the huge number of people already unemployed in the country The government has simply put many of them on the public payroll That and overseas bank accounts is where the money goes And now it is gone The same applies more or less to Iran which has a more diversified if ramshackle private sector but still relies on energy exports to fund the budget Iraq has a primitive banking sector while Iran is is opaque and unreconstructed Neither state has the ability to borrow on international markets longterm And even if they did interest payments and redemptions would simply represent another drain on the public finances In theory at least other oil producers face similar challenges But costs can be cut Saudi Arabia can produce up to 12 million barrels of oil a day very cheaply still has significant financial reserves and can borrow on domestic and international markets It has other natural resources and a highly developed health infrastructure It acted fast and early in closing mosques schools and shopping malls quarantining parts of the Eastern Province and now Riyadh Makkah and Madinah and restricting international and much domestic movement The other Arab Gulf states have acted with a similar sense of urgency and responsibility with most of them effectively closing their borders to nonnationals and the UAE quickly shutting down its airlines But the countries in which Iran has invested are in deep trouble Yemen is at high risk of collapse as the Houthis continue to play games Lebanon has defaulted on its external debt and is functionally bankrupt Syria is destroyed And the demographic displacement produced by conflict in these countries provides an ideal environment for viruses to spread as does Gaza one of the most densely populated places on the planet Iran shows little sign of adapting to the new situation Oil exports might have crashed real incomes are in steady decline the middle class is shrinking and the government has sought emergency help from the IMF for the first time since the revolution Tehran has welcomed humanitarian assistance from the UAE Qatar and Kuwait and has received assistance from the EU using the mechanism set up a year ago to enable EUbased companies to trade with Iran without using the US dollar even though humanitarian aid is not subject to US sanctions And Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have at least stopped claiming the IRGC is developing a vaccine But they have rejected offers of assistance from Washington and refused entry to nongovernmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders Against all the evidence they publicly praise their own efforts while seeking to blame sanctions for any failures To buy temporary social peace they may actually have given up on containing the pandemic At the same time there are reports Iran may have tried to hack into World Health Organization email accounts They have doubled down on conspiracies alleging the US military and Jews are waging biological warfare something the ignorant and the Islamist Sunni and Shiite alike are alarmingly ready to echo especially now they can no longer convincingly claim that the virus is one of God is soldiers sent to punish the infidel and the wicked Instead Iran is focusing on strongarming Iraqi politicians into choosing their preferred candidate as prime minister so he can expel US forces Ali Shamkhani the SecretaryGeneral of Iran is Supreme National Security Council was recently in Baghdad to knock heads together Esmail Ghaani Qassem Soleimani is successor as commander of the IRGC is Quds Force is not the selfisolating type either He has been spotted touring Syria and he has also just been to Baghdad Against expert advice the borders between the three countries and into Lebanon remain highly porous In Lebanon Hezbollah is cynically using the crisis to crack down on critics and promote its political allies And in Iraq there are reports that the IRGC is encouraging a new organization Usbat AlThairen to continue attacks on US forces while pretending it was not them or their pals in the Popular Mobilization Forces They clearly do not see why a global health crisis should stop the rockets Perhaps they think all those Daesh killers the US has been fighting will instead catch coronavirus and obligingly die once the American troops have gone But reality must eventually catch up even with ostriches The crisis will mercilessly expose existing weaknesses and accelerate and amplify existing trends everywhere And the indicators are mostly flashing red Conflict will not end and overcentralized authoritarian states will struggle to reform Doubling down on repression as Iran seems to be doing is not a strategy And where the only lesson learned is that for things to stay the same they must never change then popular consent will become even harder to buy It is unlikely that the US or other Western powers will feel any more sympathetic toward the region once the pandemic is over whether Donald Trump wins in November or not That leaves few other potential international partners except for China where the virus originated and whose neoimperial ambitions have become even clearer over the past few weeks and Russia which has sponsored the destruction of Syria and decided to cut up rough on energy It is not looking good The incompetence of the Iranian leadership has become clearer over the last six months Even where they have shown competence in a bad cause in Iraq Syria and Lebanon this crisis will accelerate breakdown And my guess is that it will persuade even more Iranians that they need political change That can only happen from within But there is no reason why we should give Khamenei a break while we wait If we really want to do something positive Iraq is a good place to start Khamenei and his sectarian Shiite friends want the US and therefore the UK and France as well out I do not see why we should oblige Half the Iraqi political class and most Kurds want us to stay and help though they fear to say so Leave the field clear for Tehran and Iraq will become a slave state But even if that happens it will be at best a Pyrrhic victory for Tehran The conflict in Yemen can and should be settled But neither Iraq nor Syria look like triumphs anymore Instead like Lebanon they will simply bring Iran burdens and storedup misery Sir John Jenkins is a senior fellow at Policy Exchange Until December 2017 he was

months since we first heard of the coronavirus disease COVID19 The pandemic quickly brought the world to a sharp halt locked us all in for weeks left hundreds of thousands dead and resulted in the losses of millions of jobs While we are still learning how to live with the virus and attempting to bring some sense of normality back to our lives the vicious virus ensured it left nothing the same Of all the industries it affected the aid industry has been among the most severely hit While countries all over the world rallied to support one another by sending muchneeded medical supplies and medical professionals other sectors within the aid industry were left badly unsupported So what happened to the aid industry and how will the worlds most disadvantaged people be affected The coronavirus pandemic not only created a health and economic crisis but also resulted in one of the worst humanitarian crises since the Second World War It has severely affected the humanitarian sector over the past few months As virus cases rise almost all governments are redirecting their international aid funds reducing their efforts abroad and focusing their attention at home This has included monetary aid food supplies aid workers and much more Over the past few months efforts in the health sector have seen drastic shifts from financing preventive programs vaccinations for preventable diseases like polio and measles and food and nutrition programs toward responding to their own health and security challenges amid the pandemic Aid convoys and groups have also seen their efforts interrupted due to border closures and travel restrictions making it even more difficult to reach vulnerable groups in remote areas Global challenges concerning womens health have also been directly impacted specifically those that support maternal health family planning pregnancies and protection against genderbased violence The impact was immediately felt when families were under lockdown and cases of domestic violence and abuse began to rise Scaling back on health education and security aid programs can put entire populations at risk Asma I Abdulmalik The ramification of these trends can be catastrophic both in the short and the long term In Afghanistan for example polio infections have been reported in areas previously declared free of the disease after the immunization programs were halted Also as a result of the coronavirus Oxfam one of the worlds largest development organizations that focuses on the alleviation of global poverty announced in May that it was shutting 18 of its country offices affecting about 1450 program staff and 700 partner organizations The number of people who will become acutely hungry could almost double from 135 million to 265 million according to the UN World Food Programme The crisis will make conditions even worse in countries that are extremely food insecure such as Yemen Nigeria and South Sudan In addition the global economic losses will likely cause an estimated 343 million additional people to fall below the extreme poverty line in 2020 according to a report published by the UN Furthermore in a revised report the World Bank has released new figures estimating that in a worstcase scenario about 100 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty The picture is particularly sobering for SubSaharan Africa India and South Asia Because of the acute shortage of funds and supplies and the ballooning economic crisis large donors have been forced to reevaluate their aid and will most likely have to scale back or suspend their support all together However it is now even more critical than ever that we increase our humanitarian assistance rather than scale it back Firstly organizations beneficiaries and targeted vulnerable groups were already depending very heavily on international assistance and suspending aid programs will make a difficult situation even worse Scaling back on health education and security aid programs can put entire populations at risk of diseases malnutrition and displacement Moreover a decline in aid can mean that communities become even more vulnerable to the virus and an outbreak within these communities could be very difficult to control thus putting the rest of the world at risk The world is still reeling from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic Many experts have even concluded that the worst effects are yet to come as many relief policies and benefits will expire this summer While countries are still struggling to control the virus others are grappling with the possibility of another wave The combination of all these concerns has put donors in a tough position regarding the prioritization of the needs at home Reducing or severing aid and assistance is not a luxury any of us can afford especially amid the aftermath of the coronavirus It is time to stress once again the importance of our continued efforts and support toward the collective good to ensure we all survive the pandemic Asma I Abdulmalik is an Emirati civil servant and a writer interested in gender and development issues Twitter Asmaimalik

capital Tehran in a bid to halt the wild spread of coronavirus AFP After months of piling pressure on Tehran the United States is seeing an unexpected new variable the novel coronavirus which has taken a substantial toll not just on Iran but inside its government US policymakers are asking whether deaths within the regime are widespread enough that they could alter decisionmaking although a deadly rocket attack Wednesday in Iraq which Washington blamed on Iran showed at least that the cycle of conflict between the countries is not abating COVID19 which has infected tens of thousands of people around the world has hit Iran is government unusually hard with a number of senior politicians and officials killed or infected by the disease including a vice president a senior adviser to the foreign minister and a powerful cleric General Kenneth McKenzie head of Central Command which covers the Middle East said the United States believed the impact was worse than the more than 500 deaths reported the world is thirdhighest toll after China and Italy and said US policymakers were assessing the political ramifications Of course death is permanent McKenzie told reporters Friday In the short term it is going to make it a lot harder to make decisions People are separated A day earlier McKenzie told a Senate hearing that the health crisis two months after Iranian public outrage over the accidental downing of a civilian Ukrainian plane made the leadership more dangerous as it would likely seek to unite the masses of its people against an external target There is very little evidence in the history of warfare of a regime that has a crippling internal problem that decides to focus on the crippling internal problem he said Weakened by US sanctions President Donald Trump has sought to debilitate the Shiite clerical regime through sweeping sanctions including on Iran is key export of oil Nearly two years ago Trump bolted from an agreement brokered by his predecessor Barack Obama under which Iran drastically scaled back nuclear activities in return for promises of economic relief Even with Trump exempting humanitarian goods from sanctions few companies are willing to risk US wrath by selling to Iran The current crisis in Iran is really one that has been the result of the government is own missteps in its policies rather than the American sanctions said Amir Afkhami a professor at George Washington University who has studied Iran is public health system But the American sanctions have certainly contributed to worsening an already very bad situation Iran has historically boasted one of the region is strongest public health systems Afkhami cited unconfirmed reports that some officials have flown to Lebanon for treatment as a sign of the burden on Iranian hospitals While Iran recently ordered a nationwide lockdown for coronavirus testing Afkhami said action had come too late Reliant on Chinese trade in the face of US sanctions Iran failed to cut off air links with China when the epidemic emerged and as late as February was still exporting domesticallymade face masks Afkhami said As a physician I can say it would make sense that the disease has taken a particularly significant toll amongst Iran is aging leadership How much that has arrested the ability of the leadership to make policy decisions that is very difficult for me to say partly because the policy towards the coronavirus was anemic even before the outbreak made its way into Iran Regime still standing Trump has volunteered to assist Iran with the State Department communicating US willingness formally through Swiss intermediaries although it was unclear if Washington has made concrete offers or if Tehran would accept them One key test will be if the United States blocks Iran is request for an IMF loan the first sought by Tehran since the late shah is era Barbara Slavin director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council doubted the impact of coronavirus deaths on the sprawling leadership Iran has experienced extraordinary pressure since the US imposed the oil embargo with blow after blow but the regime is still there she said The big exception she said would be if the pandemic somehow reaches Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei an 80yearold whose health has long been the subject of speculation Khamenei has described COVID19 as a biological weapon a charge Washington scoffed at With Trump under fire at home over his handling of the outbreak a rocket attack Wednesday on an Iraqi base killed two US personnel and a British soldier The United States attributed the attack to a proIranian paramilitary force and launched retaliatory airstrikes the latest round in a conflict that included the US killing of a top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January I think this pattern will continue especially because the Trump administration like so many other governments is completely distracted Slavin said The calculation in Iran must be that he cannot handle one crisis so how can he handle two at the same time

of government during the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic It is hard to generalize about any one countrys response although many have followed similar patterns of lockdown with differing levels of enforcement One thing is universal however and that is that when such a crisis happens people turn to governments to act and they often have high expectations We have seen the importance of the big state model take hold across Europe and in the US where government intervention in the economy as well as in industry has been on an unprecedented level We have witnessed rescue packages not seen since the Marshall Plan as well as direct state intervention in business and key infrastructure This is because when a crisis of such proportion hits governments must be agile enough to disregard old norms and move quickly to do everything they can to save lives and support infrastructure and the fabric of society It is a race against the clock and unlike any normal kind of policymaking I want to share some of my experience of what it is like for a government in a major crisis from my own time in office as prime minister of Pakistan One of the hardest tests of my career was managing the relief effort following the devastating earthquake in 2005 during which 73000 people lost their lives and 3 million were left homeless It was the worst humanitarian disaster in Pakistans history When the earthquake struck millions saw their world turn upside down in a matter of seconds First we had to find out what had happened understand the scale of the problem and prioritize what needed to be done first This was hard as communications were disrupted roads were blocked and supply lines were cut The whole machine of government was impacted and had to respond and quickly So we galvanized the army civil society and volunteers to help The scale of the disaster meant we were in urgent need of extra funds so we held a donors conference in Islamabad which raised 65 billion for the relief effort In this we realized that personally involving world leaders to galvanize support and raise awareness was particularly important US President George W Bush his father George H W Bush as well as Kofi Annan who came personally to the donors meeting all made a big difference Volunteers also flew in from across the world including Saudi Arabia Jordan Turkey the US the UK China the UAE Iran Japan and Malaysia It was a truly global effort We also realized the government had to be visible on the front line to show leadership and a bias for action Every day for months my ministers and I would get in helicopters and fly to affected areas temporary shelters and hospitals Of course some of this cannot apply in the fight against COVID19 with social distancing being one of the main tools Here is what I think does apply Firstly the need for swift decisive action is paramount Governments that took decisions quickly to stop the spread of the virus will be praised in the long run Those that struggled to show leadership are likely to face heavy criticism Communication is key it is not enough to just decide on a strategy Being able to communicate it clearly to the public and to the people on the ground that you rely on to implement it from local government to police and the border patrol is important Technology has been a gamechanger in many ways but it also creates new challenges for governments in such a crisis Getting your message across is harder when everyone sees what other countries are doing differently and this can build pressure and criticism of a government that is not pursuing the same strategy Governments must be prepared to think outside the box and rescue packages must be put in place Regulations that are prudent in normal circumstances must be appropriately relaxed to help the national effort The army as well as civil society should be relied on to help with distribution and supporting public services Many charities will struggle during this time and need their own levels of support to help them stay afloat and provide vital support where governments cannot Most importantly all governments must realize that we live in a globalized world and a crisis like this needs a global response Cooperation is key Past tensions must be set aside and countries must work together to help each other meet shortfalls in medicine and equipment The pandemic must be a wakeup call to all those who think unilateral action is the answer We must not let this crisis and the economic fallout from it usher in a world of more protectionist inwardlooking policy As I have long argued a multipolar world is better than a unipolar world The existence of new world powers could be a source of strength for all nations We have spent the past few years concerned about changing power dynamics as the tectonic plates shifted away from the West and toward Asia most notably China While questions will rightly be asked about how the virus started and how China like other countries approached the start of the pandemic we must also look toward the positive cooperation we have seen For example countries like China and South Korea are doing much to ease the Wests shortage of protective equipment We must do more to share personnel equipment and research and development particularly in the global search for a vaccine Countries that have learned from the experience of fighting the SARS virus have important lessons to share with the world When this crisis is over governments must take a new look at their approach to international affairs Over the past few years we have seen the major powers of the world growing further and further apart Cooperation between the five permanent members of the UN Security Council has been struggling for years And in our hyperconnected globalized world where as we have seen disease spreads so quickly the necessity for governments to be on the same page is greater than ever We all need to work hard to build linkages and interdependencies Why Because they play a key role in allowing this sort of cooperation and mutual aid to take place I also want to touch upon the role of multilateral organizations in the crisis The World Health Organization has a particularly important role to play in spreading correct information during the pandemic and supporting the global effort to find a vaccine The UN can also be a true force for good and has an important role to play in the world something I saw firsthand during the earthquake I described earlier However many multilateral organizations created after the Second World War such as the UN Security Council the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are outdated and have long since needed to be restructured Without reform to bring them up to date with the modern world these organizations will simply not be able to step up in a crisis and adapt fast enough Regional organizations also have important roles to play in supporting governments However they too need constant reform to make them more equitable and effective Most important in such times is the need for clear effective and strategic leadership We need leaders to be able to convince their people into taking these unprecedented and often painful lockdown steps while rallying support and working together with their counterparts across the world They must be able to effectively coordinate national state and local government which as we know are not always in sync All of this must be done against the backdrop of remote working with some government departments working almost entirely from home while implementing complex new policy In conclusion once the most painful part of the crisis is over we must ask ourselves how it happened What are the longterm implications And what could be done differently And the key message is Planning and preparedness are vital Every country must have the tools in place to handle a crisis before it starts After the earthquake we set up a specially dedicated unit in the government to specifically deal with future natural disasters All countries must try to plan ahead to have the adequate equipment and the expertise The army should also be specifically trained to provide emergency aid What we have seen with this pandemic is that disaster management is more global than people realized We must not let this crisis and the economic fallout from it usher in a world of more protectionist inwardlooking policy Shaukat Aziz COVID19 does not recognize borders which means that compared with other natural disasters the dynamics of how governments should respond changes immediately We have to think regionally and globally in looking for solutions Not all countries particularly in the developing world have the right specialists Not all have experts in pandemics manufacturers that can produce the necessary equipment or labs that can develop a vaccine This is why countries must have a goto window in the world where they can get help Once the peak of this pandemic is over we must set up a proactive empowered disaster relief unit that can provide the adequate equipment and specialists to any country across the world It would be a global repository of expertise This body would have expertise in every type of disaster from pandemics to floods to earthquakes It should be formed under the auspices of the UN which has the authority and capacity to help any country around the world and be able to provide physical help and prewarning and postdisaster management What we are increasingly learning is that no country stands alone in a crisis You cannot silo yourself forever global cooperation is key Disaster management must be a truly global effort Shaukat Aziz is a former Prime Minister of Pakistan This article is taken from a presentation he gave to members of the Chief Executives Organization via videoconference last month

Operate Contrary to some natural disasters that satellites can predict such as floods and hurricanes health disasters such as the new coronavirus pandemic that the world has been suffering from since last December happen suddenly While this health challenge has revealed that many countries are not ready for this kind of test after implications of the virus caused many troubles it has enhanced the role of international organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières MSF that deploy their medical staff and mobile hospitals wherever there are disasters and wars to provide aid and assistance In her conversation with Asharq AlAwsat MSF spokesperson Salwa Abu Chakra reviewed the efforts that MSF has made to help fragile healthcare systems in the area to confront the COVID19 crisis and how the organization operates in countries that are torn by competing political factions Abu Chakra clarified that COVID19 has exhausted the wealthiest and most prepared healthcare systems in the world She says That certainly makes us concerned about the projected trajectories for countries such as Yemen and Syria The pandemic has exhausted all healthcare systems that provide national health coverage Similarly we are facing tremendous difficulties and like everybody else we need to make difficult decisions given the limited resources we have These choices however will first and foremost focus on protecting our staff and patients and to maintain lifesaving activities as much as possible Syria In response to the question How is MSF dealing with political divisions in the countries where it operates Abu Chakra clarified that the pandemic did not change how we operate in war zones where we provide aid to whoever is in need without any discrimination We use our independence and neutrality to negotiate with different sides of conflicts to reach people but we do face many limitations that hinder us from reaching certain areas in the countries where we operate Libya and refugee detention centers As far as Libya is concerned Abu Chakra clarified that MSF is operating under the current conditions in the country with a local and decentralized approach that has helped us secure our health and humanitarian activities according to humanitarian need regardless of political affiliations She considered that the situation of the displaced in Libya is turning from bad to worse after COVID19 had arrived and the conflict escalated Libya is not safe for the displaced and for refugees who are subjected to many lifethreatening dangers such as arbitrary arrests and detentions for unknown reasons violence and extreme exploitation In light of the fighting and random bombing escalating and the absence of humanitarian organizations and the suspension of flights to Libya and the absence of humanitarian aid ships affiliated with nongovernmental organizations that operate in the Mediterranean Sea and the lack of European capacities to search and rescue refugees and the displaced are stuck in Libya and are in more danger than ever Yemen As for Yemen Abu Chakra clarified that the country lacks most of the medical protective and diagnostic equipment that would allow it to respond to the pandemic Five years of war have left the healthcare system in the country in ruins The disease can spread very rapidly especially in crowded areas such as cities and refugee camps In rural areas however the response operation will face tremendous difficulties considering the rarity of healthcare facilities and the neartotal absence of any capacities for diagnosis tracing isolation and other healthcare procedures The very few hospitals and healthcare facilities there lack the critical care capacities necessary to treat critical patients Iraq Abu Chakra highlighted MSFs efforts to combat COVID19 in Iraq She said The number of confirmed cases in Baghdad is the highest in Iraq knowing that the first of our virusrelated activities in Iraq started in Baghdad a few weeks ago where MSF provides support to the Ibn alKhatib Hospital in Baghdad affiliated with the Ministry of Health one of three hospitals treating COVID19 patients Iran The spokesperson discussed the reason why MSF is absent in the coronavirus scene in Iran despite having operated there for many years She said The MSF team in Tehran provides healthcare to vulnerable populations such as drug users and Afghan refugees who face difficulties in receiving healthcare It also planned to enter Isfahan by the end of March 2020 a coronavirus hotbed and had rented two cargo planes with materials that it needed to launch a temporary treatment unit with 50 beds as per its agreement with the Iranian authorities However the plan did not come to fruition The cargo for the temporary hospital is still in Tehran and we plan on using it in areas that need it the most to respond to the pandemic

The ChinaIndia Border Dispute Just Got Real Just as it appeared that China and India had reached a détente after weeks of military escalation at their Himalayan border Chinese troops have reportedly killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and may have suffered their own casualties The first deadly border clash since the mid1970s shows just how fraught relations between the worlds two most populous countries are becoming And while the geopolitical dangers are obvious and severe the crisis also presents the US with an opportunity to forge the strong relationship with India it has desired for more than two decades The current conflict began several weeks ago when the Chinese moved thousands of troops into the Galwan valley in Ladakh along what is known as the Line of Actual Control The proximate cause was Indias decision to build a road leading to a forward air base China responded by building up forces bringing in heavy equipment excavators troop carriers and possibly artillery and building a new tented barracks to support them In doing so the Chinese soldiers entered a part of the region that had long been regarded as Indian by both sides India responded to the incursion by reinforcing its troops along the 2000mile border Complicating the situation neighboring Nepal and Pakistan have been strengthening their relationships with China and the Nepalese are disputing Indian claims along their shared border No matter which side stands down first the truth is that the Chinese escalation was a decisive move one reflecting Beijings growing strategic objectives not only at the top of the world but globally Does any of this matter to a distracted US It should because the stakes are far higher than just lines on a map demarking barren lands 14000 feet above sea level I discussed the longstanding border controversy with Indias national security adviser several years ago at the Munich Security Conference He called it a festering sore India believes China occupies nearly 40000 square kilometers of its territory seized in a 1962 war which India lost decisively The sense of humiliation lingers and such Chinese incursions have shown that India has few real options to force Beijing to withdraw from areas it claims China and India had another standoff in 2017 lasting a couple of months in the nearby Doklam plateau China won by pressing ahead and building a military base The two nations have been involved in onagain offagain talks for years but the current attitude from Beijing is a new level of aggressiveness This all fits with larger Chinese strategic and tactical moves that began in early 2020 as the worlds focus moved to the novel coronavirus We have seen Chinese maritime activity in the South China Sea become increasingly aggressive buzzing US naval forces sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat damaging a Malaysian oil rig and diplomatic and rhetorical pressures are increasing against Taiwan China is using economic and humanitarian aid incentives to solidify the One Belt One Road trade initiative across South Asia particularly in Pakistan Beijing is also now turning a small island in the Maldives into a base for military air operations just as it has with artificial islands it created in the South China Sea And most strikingly China has cracked down hard on protesters in Hong Kong by passing a law which would in effect give a free hand to Beijings toughest security forces in the former British colony All of this can be read in three ways First as an attempt by the Chinese Communist Party to increase feelings of nationalism directed against not only India but other nations in the region and the US In part the party reasons this will distract its population from the likely economic effects of the global slowdown looming from the coronavirus Second it solidifies President Xi Jinpings status as a capable and decisive leader building on the success Beijing claims it had in dealing with the virus Finally at a geostrategic level the moves in the Himalayas are an attempt by China to pressure India to stay at an arms distance from the US Yes theres a chance that may backfire India may move toward America in the aftermath of the bloody border incident But the Chinese generally have confidence in their hard power and havent liked the growing sense of rapprochement between the US and India over the past five years One Belt One Road has one big problem India which sits athwart the trade lanes China wants to use to dominate in the 21st century In that sense the Himalayan dispute is about control of the Indian Ocean The US has limited capital to engage in this particular dispute Although President Donald Trump offered to mediate in a recent tweet the chances of China accepting such assistance are negligible A better approach is for the US to continue moving closer to India making it clear to Beijing that it will not allow New Delhi to be pressured out of greater alignment with Washington Most important is to end the dispute over trade tariffs that began with Trumps mishandled efforts to relieve US trade deficits On the military side a good first step would be inviting India which has ambitious goals at sea to be a full participant in the biennial Rim of the Pacific naval exercises How about an Indianled flotilla with US Japanese and Australian warships as a centerpiece to the event Stronger ties with India have to be part of a larger strategy for the region The US should continue to explore ways to get closer to Taiwan and apply appropriate sanctions to Beijing over actions in Hong Kong Freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea should continue Washington needs to build a solid bloc of opposition to Chinas military and economic coercion involving not only India but Japan South Korea Australia Singapore and other partners The tensions at the top of the world are important and dangerous but solving them has to be part of the larger approach the US takes with China Bloomberg

Sri Hasmy Agam Prof Anis H Bajrektarevic KUALA LUMPURVIENNA The COVID19 situation is very worrying indeed alarming matter not just as a global health and biosafety issue but potentially as a global security challenge too While the pandemic is being dealt with by the World Health Organization WHO along with other relevant United Nation Specialized Agencies UN SA the situation is deteriorating rapidly and could easily get out of control This of course if it is not effectively contained In such a more and more likely scenario it would be engulfing the entire world whose effects and impact would be akin to that of a Third World War though initially of a different kind We are amazed as to why the Security Council has not stepped in It should have done so as to address the Covid19 and surrounding scenery in the way it clearly deserves to be dealt with given its devastating impact on the entire international community on almost every dimension including international peace and security which indisputably falls under its mandate under the UN Charter As the Council has often dealt with issues which are sometimes not ostensibly related to international or regional security and of much less importance or urgency than this dreadful pandemic we are puzzled indeed alarmed as to why it has chosen not to come to grips with the pandemic as a matter of the utmost urgency If the members of the Council for their own internal reasons have not felt compelled to do so shouldnt the other members of the world body individually or collectively as international or regional groupings such as the European Union EU the NonAligned Movement NAM G77 African Union AU or ASEAN take the muchdesired initiative to call on the Security Council to imperatively address this global pandemic even as the WHO and other concerned UN agencies much to their credit are dealing with the issue from their own narrow perspectives and yet rather limited mandate and resources In this regard especially the EU would be wellpositioned to exert the muchneed pressure on the UNSC given the devastation that the Virus has wreaked on a number of its members notably Italy and Spain among others Such an Urgent Meeting indeed Emergency Special Session of the UN Security Council at this point in time would be greatly applauded by the entire international community as it would accord the world body the leadership role that its members expect it to play at this most critical point in the post WWII human history Gens una sumus Concordia patria firmat In this dire situation the big powers should put aside their ideological and policy differences as seen in the UN General Assembly case and focus instead on galvanizing concerted international actions of ensuring the safety full respect of humanitarian law and undiscriminated wellbeing of the entire human race By decisively and urgently acting the UN SecretaryGeneral and the UN SC would be sending a bold and clear yet tranquilizing signal to the entire humanity More importantly such a unison voice would be also welcomed and well understood as a referential not to say a norm setting note by other crucial agencies such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights UNHCHR International Labour Organization ILO International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO World Tourism Organization WTO as well as by the Red Cross IFRC Bretton Woods institutions Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Federation of Trade Unions Council of Europe CoE including other specialized or nonUN FORAs most notably developmental entities such as the InterAmerican Development Bank IADB Islamic Development Bank IsDB Asian Development Bank ADB African Development Bank AfDB etc In the following period while witnessing indeed a true historical conjuncture we need a global observance and protection of human rights and of jobs for the benefit of economy and overall security Therefore the measures imposed these days cannot be disproportionate unrelated indefinite unbalanced and only on societal expenses or democracy recession Recovery which from now on are calling for a formidable biosafety too will be impossible without social consensus Clearly it will be unsustainable if on expenses of labour or done through erosion of basic human rights embedded in the UN Charter and accepted as essential to the very success of SDGs Sustainable Development Goals Indeed countries are not just economies but most of all societies The truth is plain to see Planet has stopped although the Capital remains intact We came to a global halt because the Labor has been sent home Hence the recovery comes with labor Historically labor has never betrayed while capital has failed us many times By the same token human rights never betrayed the state and its social cohesion but the states and much glorified markets far too many times in history have failed humans Therefore there is no true exit from the crisis without strengthening the labor and human rights For a grave planetary problem our rapidly articulated global accord is badly needed Therefore multilateralism as the most effective planetary tool at our disposal is not our policy choice It is the only way for human race to socioeconomically and politically survive Covid19 is a challenge that comes from the world of biology Yet biology and international relations share one basic rule Comply or die To remind us it is not the big that eat the small rather it is a fast which eats the slow It is hight time to switch off the autopilot

agencies that deal with the consequences of conflict know the score with Syria Once the Syrian government opted to meet calls for reform not regime change in 2011 with torture and violence against its own people and once any window for internal political resolution was effectively lost in a mire of competing militias a retreating West and the determination of other external forces with their own agendas the country became a test bed for the proposition that wars in the Middle East could now last for a timescale beyond comprehension and that the capacity to inflict harm on a community was almost infinite The figures of destruction bear repetition if only to make us aware of what the rest of the world ignores daily There are 56 million refugees 62 million internally displaced persons and 12 million people reliant on humanitarian aid from an original population of about 20 million The people of Turkey Egypt Lebanon and Jordan carry the burdens of the Syrians movement But with no end in sight historic atrocities are still being added to and these in the age of the new horror of a pandemic Conflict has left Syria drastically illequipped to respond to the coronavirus disease COVID19 After nearly a decade the deliberate targeting of health facilities has decimated Syrias water sanitation and health systems According to the World Health Organization there were 494 attacks on health facilities across Syria between 2016 and 2019 Some 84 facilities in northwest Syria alone have had to close in the past four months because of violence In the northeast only one of the regions 16 hospitals is fully functioning To compound this situation there is a lack of protective equipment intensive care beds and ventilators Following last Decembers upsurge in violence nearly a million people were displaced with a significant proportion of these still displaced today Women and children make up four out of every five Syrians displaced during this conflict In 2014 the UN resolved that those in need in Syria could not rely on their government to provide humanitarian assistance in areas it did not control so it began crossborder aid operations However the UN Security Council UNSC with vetoes recorded by both China and Russia has steadily whittled away at such relief opportunities instead insisting that crossline aid provided by the regime would be forthcoming with no serious evidence to support this proposition More than 4 million Syrians rely on cross border operations to receive humanitarian assistance including aid related to COVID19 preparedness and response Crossborder assistance not only facilitates the delivery of supplies but also establishes a framework for assistance across the region including funding and coordination structures The UN last week witnessed the further tightening of this screw of seemingly interminable torment for the Syrian people Following further vetoes from Russia and China against resolutions that would have ensured continued crossborder access from Turkey to Syria at three points the limited resolution that eventually passed allowed just one crossing to do the job This was roundly condemned by aid agencies and other states The Bab AlSalam crossing which in May alone supported 1 million people by providing direct access to parts of northern Aleppo that have some of the highest concentrations of displaced persons will now close The crossing supporting the northeast of Syria at Yarubiyah was closed in January and an effort to reopen this was similarly vetoed This leaves just Bab AlHawa to shoulder the burden The vetoes had a clear political not humanitarian aim The UNSC has had enough difficulty in recent years The relentless use of the veto from a variety of states has frustrated its overall aim of ending conflict and maintaining the stability of the world In former UN SecretaryGeneral Dag Hammarskjolds words repeated at the organizations 75th anniversary last year its objective is not to take mankind to heaven but to save humanity from hell The neverending misery in Syria Libya and Yemen are scars on all of us The relentless use of the veto from a variety of states has frustrated the UNSCs overall aim of ending conflict Alistair Burt Aid agencies worry that the inability to deliver on international humanitarian law is now becoming embedded in the inevitable complexity of political decisionmaking and compromise that are the stuff of diplomacy UN voting leaves little hope for despairing civilians and those who exist to keep them alive UN peacekeepers and the secretarygenerals representatives just cannot do their work in such circumstances Ghassan Salames despairing recent interview in which he recounted efforts to evade the arms embargo of Libya by the states sitting across the table from him publicly advocating it is another example It is not too late to respond to UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres plea for a global ceasefire as evidence increases that the pandemic remains virulent and expanding But in the absence of this it would be good if the UNSC made a start by upholding humanitarian law and getting behind its own representatives to bring conflicts to a conclusion while starting to repair the lives of those left in their wake Alistair Burt is a former UK Member of Parliament who has twice held ministerial positions in the

its way into societys fissures widening them and exposing each societys unique vulnerabilities In the US it is a deeply unequal health care system and a nationalistic president who rejects multilateralism In Israel it is parliamentary paralysis and a prime minister poised to salvage his power In Gaza it is a health care sector decimated by conflict and closure by Israel and a governing authority deprived of the power to govern Seventeen coronavirus cases had been identified in the Gaza Strip at the time of writing but after the return of 1630 residents from Egypt last week this may continue to rise As one of the most densely populated places in the world where most of the 2 million residents live in close quarters or cramped refugee camps and with high levels of poverty and food insecurity an outbreak would be catastrophic Ever since Hamas took control of the Strip in 2007 Israel and neighboring Egypt have placed punitive restrictions on the movement of people and goods The closure policy is said to be driven by security concerns Hamas has indeed carried out acts of terrorism against civilians and sabotaged past peace negotiations with violence but in reality many of the restrictions are driven by a misguided and morally corrupt logic that applying pressure on Hamas or on the civilian population can help to achieve political goals Both Israel and Egypt have relented on some of the most egregious measures over the years revealing the flimsiness of the security pretext Thirteen years of closure have resulted in a manmade humanitarian crisis The people of Gaza are routinely denied access to electricity clean water medical care and building materials Gazas economy is in crisis with unemployment at 451 percent in 2019 Residents cannot freely travel to the West Bank or abroad to access education work medical care or family The health care system has been shattered with chronic shortages in skilled medical staff medicines and medical equipment Now Gaza has a severe lack of ventilators protective equipment and testing kits Israel is a disengaged occupier in Gaza It continues to maintain comprehensive control over the Strip despite pulling its settlers and army out in 2005 As a result of this control Israel has an obligation to protect basic rights and living conditions in Gaza as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention and the First Protocol to the Geneva Convention It has done exactly the opposite As the coronavirus crisis unfolds the Israeli government has depicted itself as a magnanimous power generously allowing humanitarian goods to enter the Strip Tel Avivs cooperation has been lauded by the UN But such gestures of goodwill are insufficient and hollow Defense Minister Naftali Bennett this month spoke of conditioning coronavirus aid to Gaza upon the return of the remains of two Israeli soldiers held since the 2014 war Now is the time for the international community to push Israel to meet its longstanding obligations in assuring Palestinian human rights What should Israel and the international community do Israel should acknowledge its responsibility for the health of Palestinians across the Occupied Territories and use its own resources where needed Israel must take Palestinian territory into consideration in its coronavirus contingency plans and communicate these transparently What for instance would Israel do in the event of a serious outbreak in Gaza Will it mobilize ventilators to the Strip Will it let COVID19 patients into Israel as well as other unwell and vulnerable patients Israel has purposefully choked Gazas economy for more than a decade Now as the world economy reels from the blow of coronavirus Israel must take additional care to protect Gazas Even if Gaza manages to contain the spread of the virus its economic reverberations will be felt for many years to come Economic collapse in Gaza could threaten to end the unstable ceasefire between Hamas and Israel which is predicated on socioeconomic improvement in the Strip and thus reignite conflict With this in mind Israel should facilitate the movement of goods to the maximum extent It should remove unnecessary restrictions on socalled dualuse items with both a civilian and military application for instance materials for fixing boats or fertilizer for farming The focus should be on those sectors that provide food for the local population and that could provide a source of income for thousands of people such as fishing farming and processed foods Once safe to do so Israel should remove arbitrary restrictions on the movement of people going far beyond its current approach which only allows travel in exceptional humanitarian circumstances Now is the time for the international community to push Israel to meet its longstanding obligations in assuring Palestinian human rights Beth Oppenheim The international community should offer financial aid to support the coronavirus response across the Occupied Territories The UNs Humanitarian Country Team estimates the need at 34 million including 6 million for Gaza However money alone is inadequate it must be accompanied by diplomatic engagement with Israel making clear its obligation to the people of Gaza as an occupying power Otherwise international actors run the risk of detracting from Israels legal obligations Actors like the UN EU and US must also ensure that the nocontact policy with Hamas designated as a terrorist organization does not interfere with essential humanitarian work Beyond this pandemic the international community needs to break free of its neverending crisiscomplacency cycle Tensions erupt rockets missiles and rhetoric are traded statements are issued relief is offered Tensions dissipate and with them the impetus for policy change International actors should take the opportunity to capitalize on the glimpses of cooperation that we have witnessed between Israel the Palestinian Authority and Hamas ensuring this survives our moment of crisis It is critical that Israel faces up to its obligations to Gaza The health stability and security of Israelis and Palestinians alike depend upon it Beth Oppenheim is Director of International Relations at the Israeli human rights organization Gisha Twitter BethOppenheim

conflicts strife and injustices have been put on hold for the duration of the coronavirus disease COVID19 crisis Regrettably however conflicts and insurgencies continue apace in Afghanistan Syria Yemen Nigeria Iraq Libya Kashmir subSaharan Africa and elsewhere The danger is that if the international community is distracted by the epidemic for the next 12 to 18 months the resulting contagion of instability will have farreaching consequences for global security With the most influential foreign correspondents quarantining themselves in the safety of their homes nonvirus international reporting has almost disappeared from many media outlets Just as philosophers agonize over the question of whether a tree falling in an empty forest makes any sound what happens to worldwide atrocities and injustices when there are no investigative reporters to document and publicize them Belligerent parties in Libya have ignored calls for a humanitarian pause with fierce fighting continuing throughout Tripoli The UN Support Mission in Libya has warned that COVID19 could indiscriminately cross front lines calling on all Libyans to unite to confront this overwhelming threat It is conceivable that a full outbreak could cause significantly more deaths than the many thousands reaped by a decade of conflict The publications produced by Daesh have called on militants to exploit the fog of pandemic to escalate attacks Baria Alamuddin Daesh has been especially entrepreneurial in capitalizing on the pandemic lauding it as a divine plague designed to force crusader nations into retreat A comparably bonkers conspiracy theory is being peddled by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who says the virus is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means The publications produced by Daesh have called on militants to exploit the fog of pandemic to escalate attacks and break their supporters out of camps where they face subjugation and disease The group is propagandists have it both ways Proclaiming that those following its extremist path will be immune while offering detailed hygiene advice for how cleanhanded militants can remain diseasefree As well as attacks of growing intensity throughout Daesh is Syrian and Iraqi heartlands extremists are stepping up activities in well over a dozen states throughout Africa Daesh claimed responsibility for a recent attack in Northern Mozambique that killed and injured dozens of soldiers and police Meanwhile at least 70 soldiers were killed in an ambush by

Senegal Mali Libya Niger Burkina Faso and Nigeria to Somalia Egypt and Sudan more of a desertstraddling Ungodly Empire than an Islamic state Despite this escalating Daesh threat the Trump administration has previously signaled its intention to withdraw counterterrorism forces from throughout subSaharan Africa The disappearance of this stabilizing Western military presence leaves the field wide open for Daesh to consolidate its dominance Any troops that remain overseas may be largely confined to their bases by coronavirus and ultimately recalled home Last week at least 23 US sailors on the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt tested positive for the virus highlighting the enhanced risks faced by troops deployed overseas in crowded quarters France last week announced the withdrawal of its forces from Iraq Throughout Iraq and Syria the US and other parties are drawing down troops Washington has meanwhile effectively surrendered Afghanistan to the Taliban as the price for extracting its forces while slashing 1 billion in aid to the country Meanwhile more than 100000 Afghan workers have been returning home from virusstricken Iran arousing concerns that this will fan the flames of the outbreak UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres is calling for a worldwide ceasefire The Red Cross has similarly called for a cessation of fighting in Syria and elsewhere to enable precautionary measures to be mobilized ahead of the expected major viral outbreaks Various combatants paid lip service to this demand without necessarily changing their behavior while on some occasions capitalizing on the reduced scrutiny of their activities Not only will vast refugee camps prove fertile incubators for the virus but woe betide the thousands of Syrians who disappeared into hellhole regime prisons with starvationlevel nutrition and no medical care In many crowded Syrian camps even basics like soap and clean water are not available making it very difficult for refugees to protect their families In recent days Saudi Arabia has overseen a major airlift of medical supplies to Yemen in anticipation of the rapid emergence of infection cases there Riyadh also voiced its support for the legitimate Yemeni government is calls for a ceasefire The Iranbacked Houthis have been accused by the UN of diverting food and medical aid from civilians while engaging in serious human rights violations These forces show little intention of halting their offensives in the northwest and on Saturday night fired at least two ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia As well as Daesh in Iraq coronavirus has provided additional breathing space for the Iranbacked militants of AlHashd AlShaabi to enhance their countrywide dominance The Hashd has been shrouding itself in new layers of opacity in recent months with additional entities like the Free Revolutionaries Front emerging These resistance elements would travel to Syria and stage operations against America Israel or Arab states while longstanding Hashd factions can claim to be acting within the established rules of engagement The Hashd is energetically translating military control into economic muscle in flagrant breach of thenPrime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi is July 2019 executive order that demanded the closure of all economic offices held by paramilitaries Militias are now engaged in a broad spectrum of legal and illicit economic activities including enriching themselves by appropriating the vacated lands and property in areas with a large displaced population As highlighted by a new Washington Institute report this has led to the accumulation of enormous wealth by Hashd leaders like Shibl AlZaydi of Kataib AlImam Ali who today boast sizable realestate empires in the most opulent districts

outbreaks Though COVID19 has caused chaos and worldwide disruption it is an opportunity for governments to break out of their rigid systems and shift archaic mindsets In countries that have had one eye on the future for the past few years COVID19 has forced them to take the first few steps into the future they had envisioned albeit sooner than they had anticipated This has been evident in a number of sectors in different countries For instance academic institutions in countries such as China and the UAE put all oncampus teaching activities on hold and promptly began implementing distance learning in an effort to protect students from the risk of infection Under normal circumstances this change would require years of planning prototyping and unnecessary delays and discussions Today in a matter of weeks governments have begun implementing innovative methods to ensure a seamless transition to learning from home We have also seen numerous offices and organizations eliminate traditional attendancetracking systems and encourage flexible working hours from home This is largely to accommodate working parents who now need to spend more time caring for their children as they learn from home This shift from rigid working environments to agile ones encourages reluctant organizations to focus less on the number of hours worked and more on productivity and overall health and wellbeing For better or worse it took COVID19 to force employers to break free of traditional workplace norms This of course has been made easier by modern technology which makes adopting remote working a more efficient and effective option Governments and international nongovernmental organizations were quick to advise people to steer clear of crowded areas and closed spaces as a precautionary measure Fortunately online retail with its quick and efficient delivery services has become increasingly popular over the past few years This comes as a result of years of deliberate government regulations to support and cultivate ecommerce and the gig economy allowing them to thrive COVID19 is an opportunity for governments to break out of their rigid systems and shift archaic mindsets Maria Hanif AlQassim Asma I Abdulmalik and Sara AlMulla If there were any doubts that we have come a long way since the Spanish flu outbreak more than a century ago COVID19 has been quick to eliminate them Incredible and rapid technological advancements experienced by every sector have not only made it possible for us to work from home learn from home shop from home and do business from home but they have helped us to detect and analyze the virus with previously unmatched speed and accuracy Humanity has indeed come a long way in the past 100 years The outbreak has also prompted sectors to collaborate in the fight against COVID19 At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the country is tech sector to help battle the epidemic and multiple companies answered the call With the help of the tech industry China has deployed disinfecting robots smart helmets thermal imaging cameraequipped drones and advanced facial recognition software in the fight against COVID19 Health care tech is also being used to identify coronavirus symptoms find new treatments and monitor the spread of the disease while advanced artificial intelligence has been used to help diagnose the disease and accelerate the development of a vaccine However perhaps the most important collaborative efforts we have seen are those at governmental level especially in the Middle East and North Africa Historian and bestselling author of the book Sapiens Yuval Noah Harari rightly said that the epidemic does not recognize borders It does not recognize differences in religion or political views The real antidote is to have closer global cooperation so countries can share information more efficiently They can learn from the experience of the first victims they can trust each other and most importantly they can help each other In this regard the UAE has set an extraordinary example putting the health of humanity above political differences by deploying an aircraft that carried 75 tons of medical supplies and equipment to Iran In addition the UAE coordinated the evacuation of hundreds of Arab nationals from Wuhan and hosted them in the newly established Emirates Humanitarian City where they underwent medical testing and monitoring During the Second World War women in the US were suddenly encouraged to take on jobs outside of their homes This drastic change in gender roles was prompted by American men having to join the war effort in their millions leaving behind a large number of jobs in every sector The entrance of women to the job market has not been reversed since despite the specific circumstances that triggered it being long gone Similarly the changes brought about by COVID19 will also have a longlasting impact on our lives be it through changes in industry social norms employment learning geopolitics and more Disruptors to human life do not always come in positive forms but it is up to us to adapt and even thrive because of them Maria Hanif AlQassim is an Emirati from Dubai who writes on development gender and social issues Twitter maria_hanif Asma I Abdulmalik is an Emirati civil servant and a writer interested in

remote areas such as the Amazon society is finally waking up and realizing that the UN SecretaryGeneral António Guterres was correct when he said there should be only one fight in our world today our shared battle against COVID19 The astonishing costs of this pandemic on human life economies social and political systems and our future is becoming shockingly clearer every day Not only are the number of infections and deaths alarming but so is the outlook for humanity is collective reality and future Little doubt exists that we are now in a deep global recession with massive rates of unemployment and newly reported bankruptcies Political systems are coming under enormous pressure as their weaknesses and failures in managing their health systems and economic conditions become glaringly clear Public health fear is also spreading faster than the virus itself clearly illustrating that we are facing a perfect storm with the potential to upend the entire global order spreading social collapse and fragmentation especially among the developing world is fragile states As the world stands on the edge of this seismic potential fault line nothing is more dangerous than allowing the wars and violence around the world to continue possibily spreading to more areas already weakened by the pandemic In the past few weeks an increasing number of significant voices have been calling for a global ceasefire including the UN is SecretaryGeneral Pope Francis and scores of other political leaders A new UN draft resolution is being discussed in New York to call for this global ceasefire to enforce the point Despite public statements agreeing to temporary humanitarian ceasefires allowing for desperately needed medical supplies and personnel to help displaced citizens fighting continues in countries such as Yemen Syria and Libya In fact warring factions have even targeted hospitals in Libya a few days ago when the capital is main hospital being prepared for COVID19 cases was bombed several times by forces allied to Khalifa Haftar who have been attacking Tripoli since April last year As the world stands on the edge of this seismic potential fault line nothing is more dangerous than allowing the wars and violence around the world to continue Hafed AlGhwell Hopes rose last week when Saudi Arabia declared a unilateral ceasefire and offered support to Yemen is collapsed healthcare sector a move welcomed by the UN is SecretaryGeneral among others Many other forgotten conflicts however including the Israeli stranglehold on Gaza are raising a global alarm The Gaza Strip is the most densely populated piece of land in the world making it almost impossible for citizens to follow health directives and social distancing guidelines This same concern extends to refugee camps around the world and to the millions of internally displaced persons resulting from conflicts everywhere From a more pragmatic perspective this pandemic has clearly demonstrated that parts of the world cannot be disconnected from each other This pandemic and its political and economic consequences make it clear that no country can be an island unto itself If a pandemic or war is raging in one part of the world it most certainly will affect other parts Hence allowing civil wars and conflicts to go on unchecked will only increase the chances of refugees fleeing conflict zones to spread diseases and chaos far and wide This global public realization recognizing country interdependence must become the focus of a new global framework not only in trade and finance but also in public health climate change movement of people refugee management and overall peace and security Allowing these conflicts to rage on in this unprecedented time is equivalent to closing the doors in the face of COVID19 while opening all the windows for it to enter Now more than ever the world needs new leadership that can learn from these lessons and articulate a new future vision A new international order needs to understand that the world must act strongly and aggressively against any country threatening us all by engaging in violence and conflict or failing to control risky behavior and cultural practices that may spread disease We now know that one infected person in China can induce a global pandemic causing an international economic and political collapse The same thinking must be applied to stopping wars and conflicts With the experience and lessons learned from the past few months we have no excuse not to do better in the future Hafed AlGhwell is a

groups is too well documented to be undeniable There is plenty of evidence to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the Qatari regime is guilty of harboring supporting and financing terrorists The evidence is available on UN and US terror watch lists Some of the worst terrorists are based in Qatar and are wanted by both the UN and the US Qatar is guilty of meddling in its neighbors internal affairs There are audio recordings of its former sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa AlThani speaking to the Libyan madman Muammar Qaddafi and plotting against the Saudi leadership In one recording Hamad bin Jassim AlThani former prime minister and foreign affairs minister says that in 12 years Saudi Arabia will no longer exist but will be divided into small states The region will be facing a volcano Saudi Arabia will be facing a revolution he said For his part Hamad bin Khalifa the father of the current emir admitted that Qatar had caused a great deal of trouble to the Kingdom and said the Saudi government would not remain the same and would certainly end In addition he further said the Americans had succeeded in Iraq and the second step would be in Saudi Arabia He described Egypt and Jordan as two countries lacking dignity because they coordinated their actions with Saudi Arabia is Qatar is guilty of all these things and perhaps others as well That said the country is definitely not guilty of planting or spreading the coronavirus which is what a Saudi newspaper columnist seriously or sarcastically alleged recently on her Twitter account adding that Doha is plan was to plant the virus in China so that it could ultimately prevent Saudi Arabia from reaping the rewards of its reform plans and stop Dubai is planned Expo 2020 from happening Understandably her tweet has sparked controversy and criticism with some of the respondents wondering if Qatar were indeed behind this plot it would have been much easier for the tiny Gulf country to plant the virus directly in neighboring Saudi Arabia But whether the Saudi newspaper columnist meant what she said or not the fact remains that such irrational comments made by some commentators and pundits belonging to the countries of the AntiTerror Quartet have had a negative impact on how this conflict is perceived These baseless accusations and deviations from the origins of the rift have helped Qatar seem to be the victim when everybody familiar with the facts knows that it is absolutely the villain Furthermore such absurdities are as bad as the increased racism we have seen against Asians around the world whether in Arab countries or in Europe The images broadcast of Japanese Chinese Singaporean and Korean citizens being punched and abused in London Lebanon or Ramallah or anywhere else are very disturbing Recently a video surfaced on social media in which a Palestinian woman in Ramallah is seen berating two Japanese relief workers The woman took pictures of them and called them Corona Corona The Japanese Embassy has said it will investigate the case and it acknowledged at least 10 similar incidents involving Japanese citizens This is both sad and lamentable These baseless accusations have helped Qatar seem to be the victim when everybody familiar with the facts knows that it is the villain Faisal J Abbas Such incidents have obscured the fact that in such crises we also see beautiful moments of solidarity We see people standing together with the best coming out Nurses dancing in joy at having helped a patient or Saudi Arabia sending aid to China or the UAE opening its medical city to people from friendly countries being brought back from China and even sending aid to Iran which still occupies three Emiratiowned islands Saudi Arabia was among the first countries to order the King Salman Center for Relief and Humanitarian Action to aid China in its fight against the coronavirus Riyadh is support has been warmly acknowledged by China is ambassador to Saudi Arabia Li Huaxin who recalled Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is visit to Beijing last year and how it signaled a new era in relations between the two countries During this time of great turbulence and crisis

virtual humanitarian event organized by Saudi Arabia in partnership with the United Nations Time is of the essence in the efforts to help the people of Yemen the donors were reminded at the end of the conference When the pledges are paid literally means the difference between life and death for countless Yemeni people said UN undersecretarygeneral for humanitarian affairs Mark Lowcock who cochaired the event with Abdullah AlRabeeah the supervisor general of Saudi Arabia is King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center I reiterate the plea the secretarygeneral made to all those who made pledges to pay them straightaway because pledges on their own achieve nothing Lowcock also called on countries that had not yet pledged to do so as soon as possible and added that the UN will continue its fundraising efforts This is not the end he said The event followed a call by UN aid workers in Yemen for more than 24 billion to fund emergency aid including medical supplies food and shelter at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is making what was already a dire situation even worse Humanitarian organizations need the funding to shore up their operations in Yemen where 75 percent of UN programs have had to close or been scaled down because of lack of money There are many reasons for the dwindling funds but one of the main issues has been obstruction by the Houthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa and other territories The United States one of the largest donors decreased its aid to Yemen this year blaming the decision on interference by the Houthis In his opening statement at the conference UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres warned that aid workers face a race against time in Yemen Unless we secure significant funding more than 30 out of 41 major United Nations programs in Yemen will close in the next few weeks he said He also thanked Saudi Arabia for its continued commitment to the humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen The Kingdom pledged 500 million during the conferences opening ceremony Melissa Fleming the UNs undersecretarygeneral for global communications who moderated a questionandanswer session after the conference described Saudi Arabia as the largest funder of the humanitarian response in Yemen in recent years Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed thanked the Kingdom for its contribution and its role in Yemen in recent years Describing the humanitarian crisis in his country he said a macabre tragedy is imminent Prince Faisal bin Farhan the Saudi minister of foreign affairs reiterated the Kingdoms firm commitment to alleviating the human suffering of the brotherly Yemeni people He also passed on King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmans deep appreciation to the United Nations for its efforts in providing humanitarian work through its agencies operating around the world and in Yemen in particular He added The Kingdom has provided humanitarian aid to Yemen since the beginning of the crisis totaling more than 16 billion nine hundred and forty million US dollars Prince Faisal called on the international community to honor its financial promises to Yemen The people of the country are looking forward to an effective resolution that will help them face the humanitarian military security and economicdevelopment challenges they face due to the inhuman practices and violations by Iranianbacked Houthi militiasblocking out humanitarian aid looting relief convoys and impeding its access to all Yemeni lands he added The prince also highlighted the refusal by the Houthis to accept any political solution to the crisis in Yemen based on international resolutions and the Stockholm Agreement and thus the Houthi denial of all efforts and initiatives for a ceasefire and the UN Envoy for Yemens invitation to engage in direct negotiations between all Yemeni parties READ MORE Saudi Arabia to organize virtual donors conference for Yemen in partnership with UN Saudi Arabias donor conference embodies Kingdom is support of Yemen Donors seek to raise 24 billion for Yemen The pledging event brought together representatives of more than 125 UN member states international organizations UN agencies NGOs and civilsociety groups to raise funds to meet the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs the UNs humanitarian agency echoed the pleas for those who pledged to actually pay early because the operation in Yemen is severely severely underfunded We are running out of time COVID19 has created new needs there but it is just the latest challenge in an already deteriorating situation AlRabeeah said during a press conference after the event The UN has accused the Houthi rebels of underreporting the number of coronavirus cases I leave this conference with a positive attitude AlRabeeah added Even though the pledging did not reach last years numbers it is a very good response taking into account the various factors at play from COVID19 and the economic crisis resulting from it to the reticence of some donors due to violations of humanitarian aid He vowed that the Kingdom will continue to advocate for a political solution to the war in Yemen to support the country and to work hard to assist in its battle against Covid19 If we continue to advocate these points then we are not far from reaching a better future for Yemen he said Lowcock thanked AlRabeeah for the Saudi collaboration on a conference that highlighted the wide issues that are adulterating the human response in Yemen and restrictions by parties in Yemen which made our work there harder He again urged donors to pay promptly otherwise the lifesaving programs will simply close Those who have not pledged it is important that they stand up and play a role He said UN fundraising efforts will continue adding We cannot be satisfied with what where we got today Whats needed in Yemen is peace but in the meantime we have to keep people alive AlRabeeah noted that although only about half the money being sought was raised it is enough to maintain the momentum of humanitarian work in Yemen He said It is important to keep the work going There needs to be determination on the part of the UN and donor countries that we will do what it takes to protect those donations We hope that the hindrances to humanitarian workers and to the aid itself will be limited and minimized It is about time for those who violate international law to stop and to allow the international community to do the humanitarian work We should not shy away from bringing those violations to light and to the attention of international community We should also make it clear at the Security Council that those violations are happening on this or that side Enough selling the lives of the Yemeni people for political motives added AlRabeeah PLEDGES IN Austria 11m Belgium 1 552m Bulgaria 1 55000 Canada 1 2903m Cyprus 55000 Czech Republic 737000 Denmark 341m European

struggle to cope with the spread and human toll of the coronavirus disease COVID19 fears are increasing about how the virus will affect the worlds most vulnerable people Refugees and internally displaced people Many refugees live in highdensity urban areas or in camps Both are vulnerable to the spread of COVID19 given their high population density and hosting of people who are often in poor health and lack sufficient services Humanitarian workers are raising the alarm from camps all over the world such as Nduta in Tanzania Moria in Greece multiple camps for Syrians inside and outside the country and Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh There are also concerns about conditions in other locations with high numbers of asylum seekers and migrants such as the USMexico border and South American localities housing many people who fled Venezuela In nearly all locations with a high concentration of refugees and asylum seekers the population already has multiple health problems They are often exhausted stressed exposed to the elements with insufficient shelter and malnourished Many have not been able to access medical treatment for health concerns When COVID19 hits groups like this disease could spread particularly easily with many individuals illprepared to fight the infection Furthermore conditions in camps often make it impossible to practice the basic methods for controlling the virus spread Refugees often lack access to soap or even sufficient water frequently waiting in large groups to receive water or food or to wash Access to items such as gloves medical masks or hand sanitizer is often out of the question Many camps are reliant on humanitarian aid and there are concerns that border closures or other containment measures might disrupt supplies or the ability of humanitarian workers to enter camps In many areas where refugees live overcrowding is a major problem This is true in many places from formal refugee housing in Germany to informal housing in urban areas and official refugee camps but overcrowding is particularly severe in several particular camps For example David Miliband head of the International Rescue Committee IRC has noted that Coxs Bazar and the camps on the Greek islands have density rates that are multiple times greater than that of New York City or Wuhan The overcrowding makes it impossible to practice social distancing and extremely difficult to isolate anyone infected with COVID19 Overcrowding also complicates access to health care with many of the medical workers and facilities in such locations already at or above capacity even before the coronavirus crisis The pandemic has also created blockages and delays in the asylum claim and refugee resettlement processes Asylum allows people who have fled danger in their home country to request to stay in a safer country while refugee resettlement is a process managed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR that allows a very small percentage of the most vulnerable refugees to be resettled in another country The pandemic has complicated these processes due to social distancing measures people working from home and other factors Some countries have suspended asylum applications and refugee transfers while others are still trying to process claims and provide services but face delays and problems as a result of restrictions designed to stop the virus In March UNHCR temporarily suspended refugee departures for resettlement reflecting multiple obstacles such as declines in air travel border closures and some countries suspending the reception of refugees The IRC UNHCR Doctors Without Borders and other organizations that work with refugees are calling on governments to recognize both a moral duty to protect refugees and the practical reality that uncontained outbreaks among refugee communities would set back global recovery efforts More funding and equipment is needed and governments should ensure ongoing humanitarian access to refugee populations The IRC is working to fight COVID19 misinformation among refugees and is asking for help to set up handwashing stations and the capacity for medical triage and quarantine The UNHCR is providing washing supplies and facilities teaching about virus prevention helping to set up isolation units and more In March UNHCR requested 255 million for the next nine months to include virus prevention and management efforts Refugees themselves are helping how they can for example some refugees in camps are sewing masks for others Uncontained outbreaks among refugee communities would set back global pandemic recovery efforts Kerry Boyd Anderson The pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of refugees and the need for global action to address overcrowding and a lack of health care food sanitation shelter and equipment The pandemic has also highlighted the value that refugees can offer in their new homes with multiple stories from around the world of refugees who are now doctors and nurses caring for COVID19 patients in their adopted countries Other refugees are producing masks performing essential jobs and contributing to their communities in multiple ways There is a moral imperative for governments and publics to help the most vulnerable people in a crisis There also is a pragmatic reason to ensure that refugee camps and other locations do not become major sources of the viruss spread The conflicts and crises that drive refugee flows demonstrate how such problems do not stay contained within borders just as a virus cannot be fully contained behind borders Governments need to work together to limit the spread of COVID19 now and in the future This is not the time to roll back protections for refugees but rather to improve refugees environments and consider how to streamline and update asylum and resettlement processes in the future Kerry Boyd Anderson is a writer and political risk consultant with more than 16 years experience as a professional

it at the last moments over the coronavirus fears After conducting the tests and preparations to carry out the operation the French professor declined at the end to do the surgery due to the spread of

released only after four days The patient was able to move all her limbs following the operation Speaking on the details of the operation Dr AlJahani described it as delicate and very risky He said the girl was suffering from a tumor at the base of the skull close to the arteries feeding the brain The risk lied in the intertwining of major arteries feeding the brain with the tumor hence making it difficult to separate the tumor from the arteries There was a risk if the major artery feeding the brain was damaged then the whole right side of the brain would malfunction She might lose her sight and hearing in the right side while the left side of her body would be paralyzed God forbid Dr AlJahani said this is the operation in which he was under tremendous stress due to the situation and the time factor Furthermore he conducted the operation owing the responsibility as the hospital had refused to do it due to crowding of COVID19 patients affecting the bed capacity of the Colmar

recent online talk titled Will COVID19 exacerbate or defuse conflicts in the Middle East organized by the Atlantic Council Rosemary DiCarlo UN undersecretarygeneral for political and peacebuilding affairs called for a reshuffling of priorities to combat the pandemic which has placed the region is longrunning conflicts in a different light She admitted that there is no good time for a pandemic but said the outbreak has hit at a difficult moment with the international community and rulesbased order built after World War II under increasing attack Libyans wearing protective face masks queue

have drawn in regional and global powers and actors displaced millions and collapsed state and local institutions Before the pandemic Antonio Guterres the UN secretarygeneral had underscored the urgent need for effective crisis management systems and lines of communication in the Gulf region she said That need is greater now than ever before Any miscalculation and the current atmosphere can lead to consequences that could overwhelm the mechanisms that are currently in place DiCarlo drew attention to Guterres appeal for a global ceasefire so that all efforts could be aimed at fighting the coronavirus His call has resonated around the world 115 member states have endorsed his appeal as have regional organizations civil society religious leaders and 24 armed groups she said According to DiCarlo the challenges for conflict prevention and resolution efforts include the economic fallout of the pandemic which could lead to civil unrest and violence As countries slowly lurch back to life from weeks of lockdown the demands for economic recovery may grow beyond the capacity of many states she said The rate of unemployment is skyrocketing and the decline in oil and gas prices is further straining national finances DiCarlo cited the protests and violence in Lebanon and Iraq as reasons for concern given the risk of humanrights violations adding that the shrinking civic space in the region poses an obstacle to fighting the pandemic We have seen discrimination in accessing health services increased cases of domestic violence and an overall disproportionate impact on women and on households headed by women DiCarlo said Refugees and internally displaced persons as well as detainees and abductees many living in crowded and squalid conditions have been particularly vulnerable Migrant workers in the Gulf have faced growing pressure to return home DiCarlo said migrant workers were most vulnerable to high prices and food shortages and faced limited access to health care and crowded living conditions To cap it all there is the continuing threat of terrorism she said In DiCarlo is view the pandemic is occupying the attention of governments giving terrorist groups an opportunity to strike Syrian Muslims wearing face masks attend the Friday prayer at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on May 15 2020 following the authorities decision to allow prayers on Fridays in

operations in the impoverished country after 75 percent of UN programs had to shut their doors or reduce operations because of a lack of funds Saudi Arabia answered the humanitarian call by organizing

the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Saudi diplomacy The fact that you can hold such a conference with such wide participation under the current circumstances virtually and with the economic clouds hanging in the air over the heads of the participants and then come up with actual results I think that is a major success AlMouallimi described the situation in Yemen as catastrophic both in terms of the

the UNled political process remains elusive despite our efforts she said Recent developments in wartorn Libya are also doing little to inspire optimism When parties have called for humanitarian truces

demonstrator during clashes in downtown Beirut on August 8 2020 following a demonstration against a political leadership they blame for a monster explosion that killed more than 150 people and disfigured the capital Beirut Short Url Even before that massive explosion in Beirut on Tuesday the situation in the country was dire Lebanon once dubbed the Switzerland of the Middle East has been on a constant downward trajectory since the 1970s The 15year civil war left scars both physical and psychological and there were skirmishes with its southern neighbor Israel and an influx of refugees Palestinian Iraqi and Syrian from various conflicts afflicting the Middle East According to UNHCR the country has provided shelter to 9ooooo registered Syrian refugees accounting for unregistered refugees the real number is well above that The government which is constitutionally required to accommodate various ethnicities and religious persuasions is gridlocked in sectarian squabbling so much so that it could not provide the International Monetary Fund with the basic information required for a bailout package which is direly needed The economy has hit rock bottom infrastructure is crumbling and there are rolling power blackouts for up to 20 hours a day The Lebanese pound is in freefall joining a list of other failed currencies such as the Argentinian peso the monthly inflation rate is way above 50 percent and the debt to GDP ratio is 170 percent According to some economists the middle class has lost two thirds of its purchasing power Then came the COVID19 pandemic stretching the healthcare system and inflicting further economic pain Country after country going into lockdown deprived Lebanon of much of its remittances which account for up to 125 percent of GDP The economy is a sad example of what happens if corruption and clientelism are allowed to go unchecked That was the background against which the massive explosion rocked Beirut and devastated much of the city It destroyed the grain silos storing around 85 percent of the country is needs It also destroyed the port which according to SP Global handles 60 percent of Lebanon is imports This is important because the Lebanese economy is essentially services based and therefore dependent on imports for the most of the country is basic needs Even before the catastrophic devastation caused by the explosion Europe should have done a lot more to help Lebanon Cornelia Meyer Lebanon is Europe is near neighbor Even before the catastrophic devastation caused by the explosion Europe should have done a lot more to help Lebanon Alas Europe was busy with Brexit myriad other issues and most recently COVID19 which meant that it paid too little attention to its Middle East neighbor Europeans are worried about refugees from troubled countries in the Middle East The EU is agreement with Recep Tayyip Erdogan is testament to that fear They provided Ankara with 6 billion euros in exchange for Turkey hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees the UK becomes concerned if a few hundred migrants cross the channel in dinghies which further ullustrates the gravity of the situation If anything the refugee crisis should have made it clear to European leaders that they had a duty of care toward a neighbor who generously accommodated so many Syrian refugees even if its government is inept and corrupt French President Emmanuel Macron did not wait long and visited Beirut one day after the explosion The scenes were heartbreaking Agitated people broken by years of economic malaise asked the French leader for help and not just economic aid They want to see the culprits held to account That is not the task of a foreign country certainly not a former colonial power irrespective of how dysfunctional the political elite is The scenes unfolding in Beirut last week show how bad the situation is and that Lebanon is neighbors must help The EU has so far released 39 million in emergency aid and the first planes have arrived That is a mere drop in the ocean though The explosion left at least 300000 people homeless and initial estimates of the cost of the damage come in at 15 billion Europe will find on its borders a country in an already volatile situation facing hunger if food cannot be imported The northern port of Tripoli can never handle the volumes required to feed the Lebanese population David Miliband the former UK foreign minister and now head of the International Rescue Committee aid organization in New York put it well when he said Europe needed to respond as one to the explosion and that the UK should be part of that effort even if it had left the EU Europeans love to espouse lofty humanitarian values This disaster is an excellent opportunity to put their money where their mouth is Europe should also coordinate with the Gulf states and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank Massive reconstruction efforts cannot be undertaken alone but require coordination The EU was caught on the back foot at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic when pictures made the rounds of Russian and Chinese planes laden with protective equipment for northern Italy while EU countries were blocking exports of just such goods to their allies It is in nobody is interest to see a repeat performance particularly as Lebanon has long been a playground for foreign powers China Russia and Iran might be only too pleased to step into any vacuum Cornelia Meyer is a business consultant macroeconomist and energy expert Twitter

Renowned American philosopher and historian Will Durant called India as the motherland of our race and Sanskrit as the mother of Europe is languages German Indologist Max Muller described India as the

giant Russian military transport aircraft landing at New Yorks John F Kennedy International Airport last week must have been astounding to many who saw it It was delivering ventilators and personal protection equipment from Russia to the country that is the most powerful in the world and has the largest economy and biggest military budget The delivery came days after US President Donald Trump spoke by telephone with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin Few could have imagined that Moscow which is under US sanctions for its interference in the 2016 presidential election and its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 would send a military aircraft to provide medical aid to its traditional adversary Yet the coronavirus pandemic has upset global balances and turned international relations on their head Trumps decision to buy supplies from Moscow prompted not only surprise but also criticism to which State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus responded Both countries have provided humanitarian assistance to each other in times of crisis in the past and will no doubt do so again in the future It is not the first time during the pandemic that Russia has sent medical aid to a NATO country In March it sent 15 planeloads of medical equipment to Italy with the message From Russia with love which is also the title of a Cold Warera James Bond novel and movie The provision of medical assistance as a form of foreign aid by states in times of crises has a long tradition and is usually remembered fondly and with gratitude Another example of the current virus diplomacy can be found in the Gulf where the UAE Kuwait and Qatar have offered humanitarian aid to Iran to help it combat the outbreak The UAEs support to Iran reflects the humanitarian principles on which our country was founded said Reem AlHashemi the Emirati minister of state for international cooperation affairs Providing assistance to save the lives of those in distress is essential to serve the common good Whatever the existing political tensions with Iran the UAE and others in the region have shown that the current global health crisis is not a competition and there can be no single winner Like other countries Turkey is engaged in an intense and multilayered fight against the pandemic and the effects it is having on social and economic life In fact while Ankara battles the coronavirus crisis at home it has also sent medical aid to a number of countries During the global pandemic even though interstate relations show a deregulation trend and while we are striving to protect our own citizens we do not turn our back on countries in need said Turkeys Presidential Communications Director Fahrettin Altun The authorities in many countries are also starting to focus on and making plans for the postpandemic era The Turkish government is no exception and Ankara will be considering what Turkeys role might be in this new environment Its crystal clear that nothing will remain the same in the world in the postcoronavirus era said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan There is a global debate about the extent to which the pandemic might change the world Scholars journalists and politicians are presenting theories about the possible transformative effects on the international political system the global economy socials norms and customs internal politics and the relationship between state and society We have also seen comparisons drawn between this pandemic and previous health crises such as Spanish Flu outbreak that infected a quarter of the global population between January 1918 and December 1920 in an attempt to determine what lessons can be learned and predict the possible future state of the world Society is already evolving as a result of the current crisis and this evolution will bring change in a number of ways Can this landmark event affect the international system to the same extent as two world wars Some people seem pretty certain that it can and here are some historical precedents to back up their views The end of the Cold War for example sparked an era of rapid globalization in which countries in all four corners of the world became more dependent on each other It is reasonable therefore to expect the postcoronavirus era to bring some significant changes Some go even further arguing that a postpandemic power struggle might lead to new conflicts Given that not even the pandemic has halted existing clashes in a number of wartorn countries it is not unreasonable to expect a postpandemic world might be dominated by increased rivalries and conflicts rather than greater international collaboration This global crisis certainly presents a golden opportunity for those who oppose globalization and call for more nationalistic policies It will not be a surprise if the populist rhetoric that was already spreading in a number of countries before the coronavirus crisis is amplified in the postpandemic era However this will not bring any good results and the only remedy to counter it is an increased focus on multilateralism The examples I have given above are few in number but could be increased given the will to do so In international relations multilateralism refers to an alliance of nations in pursuit of a common goal Once the current crisis is over international cooperation and coordination will be required more than ever Only time will tell however whether the very concept of international solidarity and cooperation has any meaning in the postcoronavirus era and whether nations learn the lessons of the traumatic ordeal they are

precaution against the spread of the coronavirus EPA The novel coronavirus pandemic that has hit the world has finally reached Yemen with the wartorn country registering its first case on Friday The announcement came just a day after the Saudiled Arab coalition announced a twoweek ceasefire as the country braces for the outbreak The Iranbacked Houthis have yet to announce whether they would follow suit idly taking their time as the virus seeps into a country whose health system is illprepared for such a crisis that will not discriminate between legitimate and Houthi forces Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik warned that the coronavirus will leave an impact on the people and the country is languishing economy No one will be spared he told Asharq AlAwsat The coalition is ceasefire announcement therefore came at a timely moment Facts and hopes Senior officials politicians and analysts are hoping that the Houthis would prove their detractors wrong and actually seize the opportunity and declare a ceasefire on their end For once the militias should quit their pursuit for power and instead prioritize the interests of Yemen not Iran above all else Amid the coronavirus pandemic halfsolutions are not enough for the warweary Yemenis who on top of the virus have to contend with collapsed services and shortages of food and medicine United Nations special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths had handed the warring parties an initiative for a comprehensive solution based on a complete nationwide ceasefire several economic humanitarian and confidencebuilding measures and a commitment to resume the political process Critical moments Abdulmalik said the world was passing through a dangerous moment in its history adding there was a pressing need to ensure the Yemen ceasefire is a success in order to unite efforts to confront the coronavirus The repercussions of the pandemic on our country will be double after years of war waged by the militias he remarked We hope the militias will join our truce out of the realization of the danger confronting the world and our people I believe that ensuring the success of the truce away from exploiting it to make gains or extract concessions will not only help protect our people from this frightening pandemic but also provide a promising foundation for confidencebuilding and positively approaching peace plans he stressed He noted however that the hours that followed the ceasefire declaration on Thursday were not promising given massive violations committed by the Houthis We still have hope that they will realize the dangers of the moment and seize the ceasefire as an opportunity to save our people and end the war the PM stated Iran divorce As the ceasefire was announced senior coalition officials urged the need for the Houthis to prioritize Yemen over Iran How the country grapples with the virus ultimately hinges on whether the Houthis will prioritize Yemen over Iran Years of war in Yemen have shown that the Houthis are either completely intrinsically devoted to Tehran or partially devoted to it whereby decisive matters are firmly in Iran is hands such as ballistic missiles and political moves Others believe that the Houthis can act independently but with Iran is backing Expert on Yemeni affairs at Oxford University Dr Elisabeth Kendall told Asharq AlAwsat that the coalition ceasefire declaration was a smart move on their end because it puts the ball in the Houthi court If they fail to respond positively to it then they are relinquishing the moral high ground to the coalition she explained If the Houthis truly wanted to maintain any leadership credibility in confronting the pandemic then they have no choice but to declare their own ceasefire and focus their efforts in combating the virus she added Kendell believes that the Houthis can separate themselves from Iran and take decisions without referring to it They share a common cause with Iran when it suits them but they cannot be operated through a remote control by Tehran especially not now given that Iran itself is struggling with the virus outbreak damaging sanctions and a collapse in oil prices British Ambassador to Yemen Michael Aron had previously spoken to Asharq AlAwsat about the possibility that the Houthis could detach themselves from Iran In wake of the new ceasefire Asharq AlAwsat again asked him if he believes that the militias can act independently He replied that the Houthis can be persuaded into believing that Saudi Arabia is a more trusted and credible ally than Iran Tehran only sees the Houthis as agents in a conflict with Saudi Arabia The Kingdom on the other hand enjoys long historic relations with Yemen and is keen on its security and stability he explained Aron said the ceasefire offers the necessary space for holding talks revealing that the Houthis had repeatedly called for a nationwide ceasefire and now they have it They must show that they want peace and kickstart talks These hopes were dampened with the declaration by Marib governor Sultan alArada that the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at the province shortly after the ceasefire was announced Skepticism The hopes were further dampened by Yemeni political analyst Sam alGhabari who told Asharq AlAwsat that the Houthis have never respected goodwill initiatives by the legitimate government and Arab coalition The ceasefire is a unilateral initiative that the Houthis have not committed to and have not asked for he went on to say The Houthis have not come up with a single figure from among their ranks that could offer any opportunity to deal with any peace initiative The militias are a replica of the Khomeini organizational structure that is based on maneuvering and reshuffling of ranks in a cycle that is repeated over and over again You can go back to the massive amount of agreements that the Houthis have reneged on All they care about is suspending their losing war in order to reshuffle ranks given their major losses he explained This deadly cycle must stop with a decisive battle or a real political agreement Will the Houthis accept any such agreement Any political reading of the Houthis will show that they are not qualified for that In fact their ideological beliefs make it impossible for them to reach peace Anyone who wants to understand the war must go back to history which is repeating itself today Political initiatives are useless with the militias Ghabari said Some optimism Former Yemeni foreign ministry undersecretary Mustafa Numaan offered a more optimistic outlook saying the Houthis are expected to positively approach the coalition ceasefire The militias themselves had been calling for a such a ceasefire he told Asharq AlAwsat This is a new opportunity for all the Yemenis to come together and work without stalling towards reaching initiatives that would take the country away from war and on a new path

the Rohingya are facing a killer even more deadly than the Myanmar military Like the rest of us they must now contend with the COVID19 pandemic Two metrics are important in judging the threat of an infectious disease such as COVID19 The first is its infectiousness how easily it spreads The second is its mortality the proportion of those it infects who die from the disease At the moment it is difficult to quantify exactly how infectious this disease is But we know it transmits not just from droplets from coughs or sneezes but also from aerosols ie from people just breathing out normally We know it can persist on some surfaces for up to three days And we know that virtually no one has any kind of natural immunity to it Add to this that some people do not develop symptoms at all but can still transmit the virus while they are carrying it and you have a situation in which only the most extreme measures of social isolation and societal lockdown of the kind we have seen in China have any hope of working once the disease appears in a population In conditions such as those in which the Rohingya are living in Coxs Bazar containing the disease once it appears will be virtually impossible Their population density is more than 60000 per square kilometre with virtually no space to isolate or quarantine anyone no space even to limit humantohuman contact to any significant degree so as to slow down the spread of such an infectious disease to say nothing of the limited scope for proper hygiene in public spaces or the limited availability of medical supplies masks disinfectant gels etc are effectively out of the question For that reason alone as heartbreaking as it was it was the right thing to do to place Coxs Bazar under lockdown We do know at least from the experience of China so far that extreme measures such as this can hinder the transmission of the disease and it is absolutely imperative that the virus is prevented from making its way into the Rohingya camps Because if it does all hell will break loose We have seen from the experience of Europe that even countries such as Italy and Spain with advanced healthcare systems can be quickly overrun with catastrophic consequences In the bestcase scenarios scientists believe the disease could have a mortality rate of under 1 percent In northern Italy there have been rates of close to 10 percent of those infected But up to 25 percent of those infected develop acute lifethreatening symptoms that need hospital treatment to manage In other words in conditions such as those in Coxs Bazar mortality rates could easily reach 20 percent So Coxs Bazar is a place where if the virus gets in it is guaranteed to affect virtually everyone in the camps and as many as 20 percent of those infected are likely to die That is nearly 200000 people an order of magnitude more than those killed by the Myanmar military After all that they have gone through the Rohingya are facing a killer even more deadly than the Myanmar military Like the rest of us they must now contend with the COVID19 pandemic Dr Azeem Ibrahim Humanitarian disaster aside we need also to think how human beings like us are likely to react in these circumstances In other words what are the odds that Rohingya families fearing for the lives of their children or loved ones will stay put in Coxs Bazar and wait for the virus to infect them and decimate their families Would you stay put in these conditions But if Rohingya start to flee Coxs Bazaar in numbers what then At least some of them will be carrying the virus What does that mean for the rest of Bangladesh And what do we propose to do when that happens Will we use military force to confine them and so kill even more Will we become even worse than Myanmar The only way to avoid this absolute calamity is to take the most amount of care to quash the transmission of the virus in the country as a whole and devote every resource we have available including resources we can request from the international community to ensure the disease does not reach the refugee camps In other words Bangladesh needs to go directly to full lockdown measures as a country and it needs to do it now We must contain the few tens of cases we have already and prevent them from becoming more than 1000 If we get to 10000 we will be fighting a losing battle And after we get the situation under control we will have to regulate border crossings so as to quarantine everyone coming in for at least three weeks for the rest of this year and next We do not have time for incremental measures We cannot afford to wait for the situation to develop We cannot approach the political tactics of this by allowing the situation to get worse so that the population gets on board with everharsher measures until we go to full lockdown Bangladesh cannot afford that We must act now Dr Azeem Ibrahim is a director at the Center for Global Policy and author of The Rohingyas Inside

crisis Irans leaders particularly President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif appear to be shrewdly investing significant political capital in a global campaign to have all sanctions against the theocratic establishment lifted The Iranian leaders are desperate for the US to lift its sanctions and are placing significant pressure on the international community to release financial resources including those which are frozen under the US sanctions In a televised speech Rouhani said last week American leaders are lying If they want to help Iran all they need to do is to lift sanctions Then we can deal with the coronavirus outbreak Iran is also calling on other governments to break the US sanctions Rouhani wrote a letter to several heads of foreign governments urging them to ignore the sanctions because of the coronavirus epidemic He insisted that managing such a great crisis and danger is not possible by any single country alone particularly if that country is encountering difficulties in access to international financial markets Zarif meanwhile has been lashing out more forcefully on social media He tweeted last week US is NOT listening impeding global fight against COVID19 The ONLY remedy DEFY US mass punishment MORAL PRAGMATIC imperative In addition Zarif appears to be threatening the international community that if the sanctions against Iran are not lifted the widespread coronavirus spread there will endanger other countries national security interests He tweeted In letter to counterparts HassanRouhani informs how efforts to fight COVID19 pandemic in Iran have been severely hampered by US sanctions urging them to cease observing them It is IMMORAL to let a bully kill innocents Viruses recognize no politics or geography Nor should we There are several contradictions in the Iranian leaders argument that sanctions must be lifted to fight COVID19 Dr Majid Rafizadeh The Iranian leaders campaign appears to be producing results EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a video news conference last week We agree in supporting the request by Iran to the International Monetary Fund to have financial support The EU will also send 20 million in humanitarian aid to Iran Their efforts also seem to be working in the US as nine members of Congress including Democratic presidential hopeful Sen Bernie Sanders Rep Ilhan Omar Sen Elizabeth Warren and Rep Alexandria OcasioCortez last week signed a letter calling on the Trump administration to remove the sanctions on Iran amid the COVID19 crisis To Zarifs credit the letter appears to echo his campaign It states Rather than continue to pile on sanctions in the Iranian peoples hour of need we urge you to substantially suspend sanctions on Iran in a humanitarian gesture to the Iranian people to better enable them to fight the virus Sanctions relief should encompass major sectors of the Iranian economy including those impacting civilian industries Irans banking sector and exports of oil and should last for at least as long as health experts believe the crisis will continue Failure to do so risks inhibiting the delivery of key humanitarian goods and putting the Iranian people into further health and economic peril But there are several contradictions in the Iranian leaders argument that sanctions must be lifted to fight the COVID19 virus First of all if the Iranian regime truly desires the sanctions relief for humanitarian purposes why did it refuse Americas offer of medical assistance On March 12 President Donald Trump offered to help the Iranian authorities fight the coronavirus but Tehran rejected the offer as hypocritical and repulsive We do not need American doctors Irans Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said In addition if Zarif and Rouhani are genuinely concerned about the populations health why did their regime revoke its approval for the emergency team that Doctors Without Borders sent along with the materials needed to build a 50bed inflatable treatment unit In a statement last week the group also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF said it was shocked by the statement made by officials of the Iranian Ministry of Health MoH revoking its previous approval for MSFs intervention to manage severe COVID19 cases in Isfahan MoH officials declared that the country does not need additional treatment capacity for the management of severe cases Finally the US sanctions do not include medical or humanitarian restrictions which could impact the fight against COVID19 This shows that Rouhani and Zarif appear to be trying to cash in on the coronavirus tragedy by pushing the US and the international community to lift all sanctions against the Iranian regime Dr Majid Rafizadeh is an IranianAmerican political

YORK The UN Special Envoy for warweary Yemen Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Thursday that he believed an end to the fighting is within close reach but cautioning that he had come yet again to express hope instead of to report success Despite a looming COVID19 pandemic and a global economic downturn threatening even more adversity he maintained that the UN has provided a feasible road map that puts the onus on those with arms and power to achieve it The UN has reported significant progress on negotiations particularly regarding the ceasefire However he underscored that peace is part of a broader package of needs that must be agreed to including humanitarian and economic measures He was extremely encouraged that both the Yemeni government and opposition Houthi rebels have positively engaged with UN proposals calling them important indications of their willingness to make the needed compromises for peace The civil war escalated in 2013 when an Arab Coalition joined the internationally recognized government effort to drive the Houthis and their supporters out of the capital and other areas under their control Smoking guns Recent clashes in Hodeidah Marib Al Jawf AlBayda and elsewhere show that peace remains elusive said Griffiths Describing the situation in Aden where the UN envoy fears a perfect storm is brewing he spoke about COVID19 malaria and cholera causing deaths to rise daily and a health system illequipped to diagnose and treat people exceptionally heavy flooding has damaged infrastructure and homes and longdeteriorating public services that are now at a breaking point The Southern Transitional Council STC which was in alliance with the government based in Aden has now taken control of the city leading to the stalling of the Riyadh Agreement between the two The STC has recently been taking steps to make local institutions answerable to them Thus the top UN envoy underscored the urgency in implementing the Agreement to ensure responsive governance and improved service delivery in Aden while also providing for the STCs inclusion in a resumed UNled political process to end the conflict High hopes Griffiths expressed confidence that upcoming negotiations would allow the parties to swiftly resume the political process to end the conflict and outline arrangements for a transition period before lasting peace can be established The transitional period would give Yemen an opportunity to escape the misery of conflict he said It would allow for the focus to shift toward reconstruction recovery and reconciliation Once a political solution is found he said a new Yemen could emerge where essential needs would be met families would be safe institutions would serve citizens equitably women would lead without repression journalists would report freely and differences would be resolved through partnership and dialogue I insist that such a future for Yemen is eminently realisticand this Council has a vital role to play in supporting them and more importantly the Yemeni people along the path toward peace the UN envoy concluded Protecting civilians With a COVID19 pandemic threatening the already fragile country the UNs acting Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Ramesh Rajasingham presented to the Council a bleak humanitarian outlook for Yemen During the first quarter of the month there was a threefold increase on attacks against health facilities with one also reported in April International humanitarian law requires all parties to take constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects throughout military operations he said noting that that in light of COVID19 it was even more critical to respect and protect medical facilities And amidst coronavirus fears stigma surrounding asylumseekers and people on the move is rising with more refugees and migrants being forcibly deported or detained Rajasingham also noted a disturbing increase of harassment and incitement against the UN which makes its work more dangerous and sometimes forces partners to pause activities at the time when they are needed the most Meanwhile humanitarians are facing enormous challenges including aid delivery restrictions and funding shortfalls Yet the UN official said were still reaching more than 10 million people every month with food water healthcare and other services and offering some of the best chances for people to protect themselves against COVID19 No funds to weather coronavirus He said the World Health Organization WHO had been forced to scale back its operations due to lack of funding including shuttering therapeutic feeding centers that treat the most severely malnourished children Amidst a pandemic this is shocking said the OCHA deputy chief adding that preventing disease and feeding sick children are the kinds of programs should be protected at all costs We are urgently appealing to donors to release funds now to sustain principled aid operations said Rajasingham requesting 2 billion to cover essential activities from June through December Spiraling economy We need bold action to stabilize the economy and soften the blow of measures that may be necessary to protect public health he told the Council including regular foreign exchange injections and steps to increase affordable food and other goods in markets across the country In closing Rajasingham spelled out Peace is the best chance Yemen has to contain COVID19 and we hope the parties will work with the Special Envoy to make it a reality UN News SaudiGazette SaudiGazette

nationals stranded in India due to the pandemic I came to India to get an operation on my eye We are staying in a hotel but we cannot pay for the hotel anymore And now I just want to return to Yemen sixyearold Mohammed Abdulnoor Radman said The young boy had been taken to the Mehta International Eye Institute in Mumbai for an examination of his right eye that was found to have corneal perforation on March 3 More than two months later like thousands of others he is still in India unable to return home Hussam Galeel is in a similar position He travelled to India in late February for his little brother is thyroid operation They had booked tickets back to Yemen on March 20 but when Yemen suspended international flights on March 18 in response to the coronavirus outbreak Galeel and his brother were stranded in India Who is going to support us financially here Galeel asked There are many others here like us and their situation is even worse than ours he said Galeel was referring to the thousands of Yemeni nationals who had travelled to India for medical reasons but were now unable to pay for hotels and daily expenditure such as food and drink A Yemeni national who is stranded in India holds a poster that reads in Arabic we want to return to our homeland on May 9 2020 Citizens from Yemen which has had its infrastructure weakened by the civil war mainly travel to India for medical reasons Figures from India is Bureau of Immigration show that Yemen is a major source of the country is medical tourists In 2017 11903 Yemeni nationals travelled to India for medical treatment The war in Yemen which erupted in 2015 between the Iranianallied Houthi militia and the Saudibacked internationally recognized government has killed and wounded thousands of soldiers and civilians It has also devastated the health system so that doctors in Yemen recommend advanced treatment abroad for the injured A Yemeni doctor sent to India by the government to oversee the medical treatment of 90 wounded people told Arab News under the condition of anonymity that the situation of Yemeni citizens in India was devastating We have a patient who is suffering from depression after finishing his medical treatment He is not in his right mind at the moment and might run away again from the hotel and get caught by police who would beat him and arrest him the doctor said explaining that he and his team would then have to bail the patient out of jail After Prime Minister Narendra Modi is government put the country under lockdown on March 25 several videos surfaced on social media showing

PoliceBrutality pictwittercomZ3ls4hAi7x Utkarsh Chaudhary iam_utakarsh March 25 2020 The Yemeni doctor who said he himself was suffering from depression due to the current situation said he knew of Yemeni citizens who were only able to afford one meal a day as their budgets were running low People came to India with a budget sufficient for their stay they did not plan for a pandemic keeping them away from their homes for this long he said adding that many feared getting infected Since the virus was first identified in Wuhan in China at the start of this year 45 million people have been infected in the world and more than 300000 have died The rapid spread of the virus led governments worldwide to stop international flights close their borders and impose nationwide lockdowns The Yemeni embassy in New Delhi had done little to help its nationals stranded in India since the start of the lockdown the doctor said He explained that he had seen a list sent to the embassy of 1600 names of Yemeni nationals that needed to return home but believed that the official number of stranded citizens far exceeded 2000 Yemen is ambassador to India Abdulmalik Abdullah AlEryani did not respond to Arab News for a comment A Yemeni national holds a poster that says in Arabic stranded Yemeni on May 9 2020 Fahd AlMaqtari a Yemeni expat who has been living in India for the past 18 years said that for the past two months he and other Yemeni expats had been receiving dozens of messages from stranded Yemenis asking for help According to AlMaqtari there are more than 1800 sick and wounded patients and more than 2400 students stranded across India It is not easy for people from Yemen to come here for medical treatment They usually sell something valuable like land or their cars even their wives gold to be able to afford to come here to get treated for one month or two They do not have enough to stay longer AlMaqtari said explaining how some are relying on food donations from locals Recovering patients were particularly vulnerable AlMaqtari explained as they were unable to seek medical assistance during the lockdown and were often turned away from hospitals that were only accepting COVID19 patients AlMaqtari explained that he had been in touch with Yemeni diplomats working in the embassy including the ambassador to get help for those who were vulnerable but had been ignored The United Nations International Organization for Migration IOM said that they were not aware of the situation of Yemeni nationals stranded in India However the organization released a statement to Arab News that called on consular support for stranded nationals and help for migrants in response to the COVID crisis Consular support and return assistance are a vital lifeline for many people who find themselves in difficult conditions and want to return home and reestablish themselves the statement said The IOM calls on countries to address the particular needs and vulnerabilities of migrants regardless of their legal status in the spirit of Universal Health Coverage The fight against COVID19 cannot be won unless the response plans in all countries include migrants especially those marginalized or in situations of vulnerability the statement added Being stranded here is already a big problem for us but it will get worse if we get infected with the coronavirus an older Yemeni man said Yemeni nationals stranded in India calling on international humanitarian organizations to defend their rights to return to Yemen Another man called on the government to return them back to Yemen If we are required to be quarantined we are happy to comply and do so even if it is in the middle of the Yemeni desert he said In Yemen scores of COVID19 cases have been recorded across the country but the UN warns that the virus is spreading largely undetected Hundreds of people in the interim capital Aden have died in the past week with symptoms of what appears to be the coronavirus local health officials said The officials fear the situation is only going to get worse as Yemen has little capacity to treat those suspected of having the virus However for those stranded in India facing fears of coronavirus at home is better than facing the threat abroad We ask President Hadi whom the Yemeni people voted for and the internationally recognized government to look after Yemeni nationals no matter where they are said a man who had been stranded in India for more than two months We just ask them to repatriate us like other leaders who returned their citizens home from abroad

videolink from a Parliamentary Liaison Committee on the government is handling of the global COVID19 pandemic in London on May 27 2020 10 Downing StreetAFP Short Url UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday hosts a major international vaccine conference At a time when London has been widely seen to be withdrawing from the world as a result of Brexit this is the latest example of how it is helping lead the global response to the coronavirus disease pandemic On May 3 for instance Johnson cohosted along with other European countries Canada Saudi Arabia and Japan a virtual global pandemic pledging conference that kickstarted a monthlong international investment drive ahead of this week is vaccine event which he has called the most urgent shared endeavor of our lifetimes These last few weeks of activity have built on other recent actions including by the G20 G7 International Monetary Fund and World Bank In April for instance this year is Saudi Arabiahosted G20 took a range of measures including suspending debt payments by developing countries from May until the end of this year so that those nations can prepare for the required increased spending on health care during the pandemic Despite these initial moves more action is badly needed and Thursday is conference comes in the light of the UN is warning last week of unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world unless countries act together now UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres painted a picture of 60 million people pushed into extreme poverty a famine of historic proportions some 16 billion people left without livelihoods and a loss of 85 trillion in global output the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s As he highlighted there is now a danger of interconnected threats endangering decades of international development work in what is becoming not just a health crisis but also a humanitarian and economic disaster These challenges are not just of grave import for the developing world but also for the industrialized world too given the warnings of Guterres that the pandemic will circle back around the world in a second wave if they do not help poorer nations with weak health care systems This is especially true in the context of deep recessions across many emerging markets Part of the challenging picture comes from a separate potential crisis brewing among the leading development charities arising out of slowed disbursements from governments and other donors Development charities are having problems implementing projects while their incountry teams are in lockdown These challenges are not just of grave import for the developing world but also for the industrialized world Andrew Hammond This tragic picture is the framing for this week is conference At a time when UK foreign policy has become largely focused on Brexit the pandemic has provided a way for London to renew its international leadership even though the country has suffered some 40000 deaths due to the pandemic Johnson said at last month is conference which raised about 8 billion in pledges that the battle against coronavirus must see governments work more closely together to build a shield around international populations and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine He also asserted that the more nations pull together and share expertise the faster scientists will discover a vaccine to prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible He argued that by strengthening health systems in developing countries London and its partners can play a part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus and save lives everywhere The UK has led the way on this agenda pledging 388 million 488 million in aid funding for research into vaccines tests and treatments alongside 330 million a year over the next five years to Gavi the Vaccine Alliance This is part of a larger 744 million UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy which includes 250 million for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus the biggest such donation to the fund by any country While President Donald Trump last week ended the US membership of the World Health Organization WHO London has taken a very different path pledging 200 million to help slow the spread of the virus in vulnerable countries Of that funding 130 million will go to UN agencies including 75 million for the WHO which is coordinating the global response to the pandemic The UK is work on vaccine development is also progressing at pace Last month for instance the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca announced a partnership to support the largescale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine being trialed by the university Thursday is conference will therefore significantly bolster the international response to the pandemic which has been set back by Trump is WHO decision For the UK is international partners its leadership of this agenda is a hopeful signal that postBrexit London will remain at the vanguard of global development policy Andrew Hammond is an Associate at LSE

COVID19 pandemic tend to focus on affluent countries Even when studies conclude that the less wealthy are more at risk because they live in cramped conditions and lack access to good nutrition and health care these studies apply mostly to the US or Europe And there is indeed a problem there many people have lost their jobs 17 million in the US alone as economies contract because of the pandemic Food banks are overwhelmed with queues longer than could have been imagined only a few weeks ago This holds true for countries with relatively well functioning healthcare systems New hospitals for COVID19 patients have been made operational at record speed from London to New York and from Wuhan to Paris Even in these welloff countries healthcare professionals are running out of protective equipment and hospitals do not have sufficient access to intensive care beds or ventilators countries are literally hijacking exports of medical equipment intended for their neighbors and allies This is the situation in affluent economies It becomes a lot more dire when we look at lowincome countries with healthcare systems that are inadequate at the best of times As the virus spreads countries in Africa Asia and Latin America will be hard hit Again the hardest hit will be the poor who live in slums Living quarters are cramped and sanitary appalling For them it must sound like the height of cynicism when doctors tell them to wash their hands frequently and use plenty of soap How can they when there is neither clean water nor soap As though this were not depressing enough think of the plight of refugees A conservative estimate is that in the Middle East alone 20 million displaced people are strewn across a plethora of failing or wartorn states with already woefully inadequate healthcare systems Six million Syrians are refugees outside the country They are joined by many internally displaced a million in ravaged Idlib province alone The UN estimates that 2 million Iraqis are still displaced since the Americanled invasion There are 3 million Afghan refugees and more than 4 million internally displaced people in Yemen not to speak of the conflict in Libya and other places all of which drove people from their homes Most of these displaced people live in refugee camps with a high population density little or no access to sanitation and inadequate food supplies not to speak of the lack of personal protection equipment for the aid workers looking after the camps This is a breeding ground if ever there was one for a fast spreading virus The COVID19 crisis becomes a lot more dire when we look at lowincome countries with healthcare systems that are inadequate at the best of times As the virus spreads countries in Africa Asia and Latin America will be hard hit Cornelia Meyer There have been few reported cases of COVID19 in these camps The first was reported in Greece at the beginning of this month and none have been reported so far among Syrian refugees in the Levant This is not to say that there are no cases they just have not been reported How could they when there is little or no access to test kits To make matters worse these failing states and the refugee camps in them are kept afloat by submerged trade networks which are bound to spread the virus As advanced countries concentrate on their own virusrelated economic problems aid money is bound to become scarcer The UN is World Food Programme is a good example It is chronically underfunded yet keeps many people nourished in conflict zones such as Yemen It will cut its aid to Yemen by 40 percent in the months to come for various reasons The scenarios for how the virus will spread across the least fortunate people on the planet are chilling UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres pleaded with countries at war to suspend hostilities while the coronavirus crisis was ongoing He was heard by some Saudi Arabia for example is willing to extend its twoweeks ceasefire in Yemen In Libya some heed Guterres is call but many including eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar do not There is already some sort of a coronavirus blame game going on in Libya What many of the affluent countries do not understand is that what happens in the refugee camps on their peripheries will in due course affect them too When the travel restrictions are eased as the crisis abates in Europe and the US these refugees will do whatever it takes to cross borders in the quest for a livelihood They will then bring the virus back to those countries and the lockdowns will start all over again The pandemic strategy of these OECD nations must therefore take into consideration what happens in the refugee camps Karl Blanchet a public health professor and director of the Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action put it well when he said Either we include everyone in this strategy or we strategically fail Not including these populations is a recipe for failure for our whole society The problem of how COVID19 will spread in refugee camps is not just woefully underreported it matters to the affluent of the world just as much as it does to the most deprived As humanity we need to take care of the weak because it is the right thing to do but also out of selfinterest Cornelia Meyer is a business consultant macroeconomist and energy expertTwitter MeyerResources Disclaimer

Jordanians swell their time away at a smoking joint Supplied Short Url AMMAN Zeina a 32yearold Jordanian national is very particular about protecting herself in the COVID19 era She washes her hands regularly wears a face mask and observes social distancing But as she sat with her friends in an upscale shisha cafe in Amman is Abdoun neighborhood on a recent evening she was unaware of the fact that she was inhaling 6000 chemicals every time she drew flavored tobacco smoke through water I tried to kick the habit many times but meeting friends at cafes forced me to return to it Zeina told Arab News That aspect of her social life has just come to a stop On July 1 Jordan extended a ban on all forms of smoking in closed public spaces citing the fight against the pandemic In order to protect the health and safety of citizens especially given the COVID19 pandemic and its aftermath smoking of all forms cigarettes ecigarettes and shisha is banned in all closed public spaces the Health Ministry said On June 23 Londonbased newspaper The Guardian published results of a study by the World Health Organization WHO and Jordan is Health Ministry that said the kingdom had surpassed Indonesia to have the highest smoking rates in the world The study showed that more than eight out of 10 Jordanian men smoke or regularly use nicotine products including ecigarettes and that 66 percent of Jordanian men and more than 17 percent of Jordanian women are smokers Jordanians swell their time away at a smoking joint Supplied The Department of General Statistics revealed that by the end of the first quarter of 2020 the total spend on smoking reached 16 billion Jordanian dinars 226 billion about 6 percent of the country is gross domestic product with every Jordanian spending on average 115 dinars on cigarettes per year Mohammad Shreem director of Jordan is AntiSmoker is Society said when it researched the cost ratio of smoking it concluded that for every dinar earned as revenue from cigarette sales tax Jordan spends 12 times as much on treating smokingrelated diseases The country annually loses 4 billion dinars in medical expenses and 95 percent of people with lung cancer are smokers he said adding Their absence also hurts the economy because it lowers productivity On the social level it is easy to see how popular smoking is in the country Ads target the Jordanian public across all platforms including social media One of them reads Smoke the argileh water pipe while driving or have it ordered to your house Comes ready with red hot coals Only for 10 Jordan has had a ban on smoking cigarettes in public places since 2008 but it was not forcefully implemented Before the latest ban that now covers ecigarettes and shisha many Jordanians were unaware that smoking in public places is a criminal offense that comes with a fine of 100 dinars and up to a month is imprisonment Ayman a resident of Amman is AlWeibdeh neighborhood has been smoking for three years because everyone around him is a smoker Is he aware of the 2008 law I have never heard of it and no one is implementing it he told Arab News There was a reason for the lack of implementation over the years said economic expert Mazen Marji The Jordanian government has a stake in the widespread habit of smoking because it profits even more from it than do cigarette companies It collects 75 percent taxes on cigarettes which amounts to 1 billion dinars he told Arab News Many Jordanians put aside money to buy cigarettes often at the expense of their food budget and while these may be personal compulsions the government takes the responsibility for not implementing the law on smoking in public places he said Muwafiq Malkawi a columnist for the daily AlGhad newspaper concurs with Marji on the government is responsibility We criticize citizens on their lack of awareness of the dangers of smoking but let us first look at the faulty government policies on tobacco Malkawi wrote in one of his columns This has become a powerful industry especially because it brings to the government coffers JD 1 billion 14 billion a year Cigarette companies are a powerful lobby around the world and they impact governmental decisionmaking Cigarettes lobbies however are not the only forces at work in Jordan to prevent smoking from losing popularity INNUMBERS 6 Share of Jordan is GDP spent on smoking in 2019 9000 Daily deaths blamed on smokingrelated complications 226 billion Total spend on smoking in 2019 In 2014 the Health Ministry made valiant attempts to enforce the public health law and stop the use of shisha in cafes but the pushback from cafe owners and investors proved to be too strong Eventually a compromise was reached with a health warning stuck on premises that goes largely unnoticed by the public When Arab News spoke to a crosssection of Jordanians on why antismoking campaigns fail they attributed it predominantly to the absence of rigorous implementation of the law with community pressure and the low price of cigarettes following close behind In Jordan prices are low and so everyone can buy cigarettes without making a dent in their budget This is a huge factor that encourages smoking said Malkawi Marji pointed to the possibility of an increase in smuggling if the cost of cigarettes goes up The government will have to fight that as well he said Shreem pointed to the high mortality rate from smokingrelated diseases Eight million people die every year worldwide from diseases related to smoking This is a much higher figure than the rate of fatalities due to the coronavirus until now yet smoking is still to be listed as a pandemic in the Arab world he said Smoking a traditional water pipe is popular in Jordan is cafes above and below and also on the beach in the city of Aqaba on the Red Sea Princess Dina Mired a Jordanian humanitarian and health activist has spoken on this issue pointing to smoking is high cost to public health Thanks to lax implementation of the law on smoking six global companies are spending a lot of money to entice the young to smoke she said She welcomed the July 1 ban and expressed hope that it will be properly implemented Firas AlHawari head of the lung unit and the intensive care unit at the King Hussein Cancer Center told Arab News We are at war with smoking which is reaching children and adolescents The problem is getting worse due to ecigarettes Referring to Jordan is nonimplementation of the WHO is 2005 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control which asserts the importance of demandreduction strategies as well as supply issues AlHawari did not mince words The smoking averages in Jordan are a warning that we are approaching a pandemic of noncommunicable diseases he said

Getty Images Short Url NEW YORK The antiracism protests on the streets of New York outside could be heard as the indignant crowds called for nothing less than the end of systemic racism in their country From his office Saudi permanent representative to the UN Abdallah AlMouallimi who has lived in the US for many years mused on the significance of American protests Events in the United States are an indication of the vitality of American society he said Protests show the strength of that society its ability to mobilize in the face of crisis It also shows some of the shortcomings in the American system with regard to racism and discrimination But I know that the majority of Americans are peaceloving They love the interaction of various ethnic backgrounds And I hope that our friends in the US will be able to overcome the current difficulty they are now going through AlMouallimi said The conversation quickly turned to another country that has been in the headlines this week Yemen The situation in Yemen is catastrophic both in terms of the humanitarian situation and in every other respect said AlMouallimi As the country continues to reel under what the UN has many times described as the world is worst manmade humanitarian crisis international organizations have made pleas for funding to shore up their operations in Yemen after 75 percent of the UN programs had to shut their doors or reduce operations because of the lack of funds Demonstrators gather to protest against racial inequality in the aftermath of the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd in New York Saudi Arabia answered the humanitarian call by organizing a pledging event cohosted by the UN where participants included representatives from more than 125 member states 135 billion was pledged falling short of the 25 billion that the organizations said they needed to keep their operations going AlMouallimi explained that the initial pledges though about half of what had been sought were normal for an event of this magnitude International donors do not achieve more than 50 or 60 percent of the target because basically the target is there to be completed over a full year We are still in the first half of the year We still have some time So the pledging conference achieving 50 or 60 percent is considered a success in many ways The conference was a huge success for the United Nations and for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Saudi diplomacy The fact that you can hold such a conference with such wide participation under the current circumstances virtually and with the economic clouds hanging in the air over the heads of the participants and then come up with actual results I think that is a major success AlMouallimi said The UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs Mark Lowcock who cohosted the conference was quick to urge donors to pay their pledges immediately because time is of the essence for humanitarian organization to resume operations in Yemen When the pledges are paid literally means the difference between life and death for countless Yemenis Lowcock said AlMouallimi said Saudi Arabia would continue to work on two tracks The humanitarian track where the followup to that conference will be the collection of the funds the disbursement of these funds through the United Nations and our channels and the actual implementation of projects to help the Yemeni people on the ground including provisions of food and medicine The second track is the political track The UN envoy continues to work his way through the various obstacles that are in his way but I believe that with the determination of the Yemeni people and all the parties that are supportive of Yemen we will be able to overcome these difficulties Prince Faisal bin Farhan the Saudi minister of foreign affairs pointed to the main obstacle in the way of humanitarian work due to the inhuman practices and violations by Iranianbacked Houthi militias blocking humanitarian aid looting relief convoys and impeding access to all Yemeni lands The international community has constantly been working to overcome such hurdles AlMouallimi noted that every time there is a difficulty the UN and the international community react by withholding the supply of this aid or freezing it for a certain period of time or redirecting it to other channels or our way and this usually prompts the Houthis to reconsider their position and to allow the aid to pass through It is a game they are trying to play to gain advantage but one needs patience and a longterm view of the situation The international community needs to continue to put pressure on the Houthis both moral and political pressure as well as on the ground And that is what we are doing with our partners in the Yemeni government The Houthis will continue their obstructive behavior and we will continue to change or correct it Apart from Yemen and the US protests the coronavirus pandemic continues to haunt AlMouallimi who seemed disappointed at the lack of cooperation among countries to fight off the virus The international community should have shown more solidarity more coordination more commitment to working together and enhancing the role of the multinational organization such as the UN and its subsidiaries He said that from the beginning Saudi Arabia has assumed its leadership role The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques invited world leaders of the G20 to a virtual summit the first of its kind that was held couple months ago and as a result of that summit certain measures and steps were agreed and were taken to help combat the coronavirus Subsequently the Kingdom has announced numerous steps including a contribution of 500 million to various channels that is aimed at fighting the coronavirus including 150 million that was earmarked for helping in the development of a vaccine and treatment and medications to help treat the disease So the Kingdom has been taking a leading role in that respect We have provided support to the WHO and we have also provided specific assistance to certain countries that are vulnerable including Yemen and our Palestinian brothers and sisters so that they can overcome the difficulties that are associated with this virus

representative for the Syrian war and the fight against ISIS said the US supports in every possible way diplomatically and logistically Israeli raids on Iranian sites in Syria In an exclusive interview with Asharq AlAwsat Jeffrey said that Iran has very established footholds in the Syrian state and within Syrian society noting that many Arab countries will never be in harmony with a man like President Bashar Assad They can claim that they can distance him from the Iranian orbit but I see that this is absolutely not possible The American envoy emphasized that his country will continue to impose sanctions on Damascus and we support the entry into force of sanctions on the Syrian regime until its acceptance of a political solution explaining Economic sanctions make the situation worse for the circle of people very close to the head of the regime and this is what we are always trying to reach And we want to make it clear to these figures that there is no clear future for them if they continue to support Assad They should rather press for political transition He pointed out that the recent Russian media campaign against Damascus is evidence that Moscow is also aware of what kind of ally they have in Syria today He said that Idlib is the citadel of opposition and will not return to Damascus soon Here is the text of the exclusive interview that Asharq AlAwsat did by Phone Thursday Let is start with Covid19 Could you give me your assessment Also yesterday in the Security Council the Russians once again rejected reopening Yarobiyeh the crossing between Iraq and Syria What is your assessment on that as well First of all we are following the situation of the coronavirus throughout Syria We have to look at it in three different areas the northeast where we have the best eyes on the northwest where we rely on Turkish information and of course the regime areas which are totally underreported and underrepresented We have only notional information from the regime areas We think that there is a considerable amount of cases there but we cannot measure it We do not see at the moment a significant outbreak of the virus in the northwest but of course with so many people jammed together and with such bad medical support particularly as the Russians and Syrians have bombed most of the hospitals and other medical facilities there that would be of great concern In the northeast there have been one or two reports of infections but we are yet to see a significant outbreak To some degree the few reported cases are due to the limit on travel in and out of the country other than for the Iranians who we think spread it initially in regime areas So the effects of it have been limited but that can change at any time The UN is worried about this the WHO is worried about this and we are as well The Russians and the regime by blocking the transfer of medical supplies to those areas where Assad does not hold sway of course have made the situation worse It is Assad is fault It is his fault in his own areas for having devastated his own country and not caring about its people He is even more at fault in those areas not under his control that he denies assistance to even though that is his responsibility as the sovereign entity in Syria Do you think being in this pandemic paves the way for renewal or updating of the UN Security Council resolution regarding the humanitarian border crossing Because I think we are supposed to be in JuneJuly and directions in December In July UNSC 2504 has to be renewed It is our hope that Russia will renew at a minimum the two crossings in the northwest We are very very insistent on that and we would also like to see a new crossing to service the northeast As you know the crossing there the Rabia crossing was blocked from being included in the new resolution by the Russians and Chinese so that is where we are As you may know in the last few weeks even months since the beginning of the pandemic the Russians and the regime twisted the whole argument They are saying now that they are blaming the US and the European sanctions What is your reaction to that The collapse of the Lebanon monetary and financial system has nothing to do with our sanctions and that is perhaps the biggest impact on Assad Frankly his own bad management is the second reason he is in such dire economic shape and then thirdly it is the fact that this country is still at war and important areas including agriculture and energyproducing areas are not under his control nor should they be until he accepts a compromise political settlement That is why he is faced with great economic difficulties that are impacting all of the people Our sanctions do not include sanctions on humanitarian or medical goods those items can flow freely And the sanctions are carefully selected and packaged to target regime figures and not the average person In MayJune I think the Europeans the EU are supposed to renew their sanctions so what is your view on that We are very much in favor of these sanctions staying in place until the Regime accepts a political solution We see the glimmer of hope in the longerterm ceasefire in Idlib and the regime is acquiescence in a common agenda for the constitutional committee in Geneva These things would not have happened without the tough position of the international community be it the Turks in Idlib or all of our efforts maintaining our sanctions So we are really happy that the EU is maintaining them What would you tell some Syrians who buy the narrative of the regime and blame the US for their suffering I cannot help anyone if after almost a decade of Assad is terror they still believe Assad over the international community In this regard we saw some new developments by some Arab countries who reconnected with Damascus and they took the pandemic as a pretext Did you speak with those Arab countries And if you did what did you tell them That is kind of vague without identifying which Arab countries The Arab countries I am thinking of and I do not want to disclose them publicly but we know who they are we are talking to them constantly We think two things First of all they will have no impact They will not win any prizes from Assad We saw when one of them and this one I can name because it has been discussed in the media the UAE extended diplomatic recognition and they got nothing from Assad I think they barely got a thank you We know as well that they are not going to change his policies nor are they going to undercut our policy We think that some people in the region have the mistaken idea even though I am in media all the time and Secretary Pompeo and President Trump speak out frequently on Syria that maybe there is another American policy that allows us to be friends with Assad There is no such American policy There will never be such an American policy There was not even such a policy under the Obama administration In this regard what do you expect from the Arab Summit that is due in June but might be delayed a little bit The Algerians are now working hard to bring the Syrians back to the Arab League Our question to the Arab League is What has changed from when you took the decision to freeze Syria membership in 2012 Have fewer people died now had died then We think the number now is almost 500000 Arab citizens of Syria That is not a very encouraging thing to invite them back Has the Regime complied with any of the UN calls for reconciliation No What percent of the population has been ridden from their homes or fled their homes due to the regime in 2012 when the Arab League took the decision Perhaps 510 percent of the population What percentage of that population today 50 percent The Arab League has to ask itself Does it just have as an interlocutor states or does it also have as an interlocutor people of those states Because the people of this state Syria have shown repeatedly their courage and their commitment by half the population fleeing Assad is rule Some Arab countries believe that by bringing the regime back to the League maybe they would distance it away from Iran What do you think It is a crazy idea First of all Iran is deeply embedded in the Syrian state and society It is not as bad as Hezbullah in Lebanon or with the Militias in Iraq and I know both situations particularly Iraq very well But it is very concerning not just to us we know it is also concerning to the regime and the Russians You have militias that are created and paid for by the Iranian government and reports to the Iranian government But the other thing is and people really need to think about this Syria is a state where Assad is brutality to his own people is unique in the world even faced with Venezuela or North Korea Assad only knows one tool butchering his population particularly the Sunni Arab population Now does anybody think he is going to change his ways It is one thing to think he is going to change his alliance with Iran I do not think he can but at least theoretically it is possible But does anyone think he is going to change the way he rules and the population is going to accept this mass murderer this uber torturer as leader No He has to run an absolutely horrific brutal totalitarian state What country is willing to accept a partnership with a brute like that We only know of two Russia and Iran We do not think the decent countries of the Gulf and the Arab World would be in the same bed with someone like him They can claim they can wean him away from Iran I doubt that very much Will these countries provide the ground forces the Hizbullah troops and the Shia from Afghanistan and other countries to keep the Sunni Arab and many other ethnic groups in the opposition from attacking Assad No they will not go that far and I do not think they will sign up to support a government as terrible as Assad is They will not bear the responsibility That is something Iran and Russia will have to do Recently there were a lot of Israeli airstrikes around Damascus Damascus Beirut highway and in Palmyra What is your view on this The US supports Israel is efforts to secure its selfdefense Israel is facing an existential threat from Iran as they have said a thousand times that their mission is to destroy Israel The Iranians are in Syria in large numbers passing on longrange weapon systems to Hezbullah that threaten Israel We know probably two elements associated with the Iranians also in Syria and Israel has the right to take whatever action it needs being careful about Syrian casualties which the Israelis are for the goal of saving Israel Therefore we are supportive of them in any way we can What kind of support Political or Logistical Through the Tanf military base We give the support that is needed for effective Israeli actions to protect itself and in protecting itself it is protecting all neighbors of Assad Jordan Turkey Iraq and Lebanon The Israeli Minister of Defense said recently that this is to finish not limit the Iranian influence on Syria Do you think that is possible Our policy is that all Iraniancommanded forces have to leave Syria along with frankly all other military forces that entered after 2011 This includes the United States if all of the reports are correct about the Israeli Air Force that would include the Israelis and it would include the Turks And the Russians The Russians entered before 2011 therefore they are exempt Everyone else came after the war had begun If there is a political solution to the war and neighbors such as Israel and Turkey no longer feel threatened by the situation in Syria we think they would be willing to let the country return to normal As far as we are concerned returning to normal is our goal and that means among others all Iraniancommanded forces have to leave You said earlier that the sanctions are working and that there are indications proving that What are they Given the incompetence of the Assad administration who is good at sucking the blood literally and figuratively in terms of money goods and property from its own people and in running a corrupt financial and economic system but are not good at holding the country together and attracting foreign investments they have done much of the damage themselves Who would invest in a country Assad runs They have also destroyed much of their own infrastructure driven away a large percentage of the country is doctors and on and on It is hard to say if you look at the unlimited fall of the Syrian pound now 1300 to the US dollar and the claims by people who are trying to support the regime that they have lost 244 billion four times the GDP of the country in the last few years because of the war it is very hard to say what is due to the Regime is own actions and what part of it is due to the sanctions I would say that in general in terms of the economy it is mainly what the Regime has done to itself Sanctions make life hard for those people in the inner circle and that is what we are trying to get at To make it clear to them that they do not have an economic future by supporting Assad They need to push for a political transition in Syria You say the sanctions will push the regime to change its behavior We think it is a combination of everything The 50 percent of the population that is fled stripping the country of most of its demographic resources or much of it The major swaths of territory that are not under Assad is hand and unlikely to come into his hands because significant outside powers including the US who are on the ground The pummeling attacks that the Iranians and the Syrians are getting from the air Israeli Strikes with ever more aggressive and effective airstrikes The lack of reconstruction assistance The ostracism of the Regime by the Arab League and by the Europeans We think that at the end of the day this formula will push the regime to eventually seek a negotiated settlement rather than claim a military victory and no compromise which is what they have been doing up until now You just said that keeping regime out of Idlib is a strategic thing Right Yes That is correct And you said that you want Turkey to fight extremists in Idlib Yes we do And we see signs that they are more effectively How can you combine those two goals keep Idlib out of the regime is control and fight terrorism And what do you think of the Turkish Russian deal over Idlib I think the deal will maintain as long as Turkey continues pressure on HTS We do not see HTS as a serious threat to Russian forces as they claim It is a threat to all of us because it is a terrorist organization and it is a threat to the more moderate and armed opposition in Idlib which is of concern to us We see no reason no excuse no justification for this offensive regime in Idlib to start up again By the same token we are happy that the Turks are dealing independently with HTS They committed to that in September 2018 and in the most recent agreement and that is a good thing And you think that deal is holding I think that it will hold for the next few months at least Let move to North East of Syria which is where the American forces are Recently we have noticed the Russians sending more military enforcement and they took a Qamshli military base and are getting closer and closer to the Americans What is your assessment of the situation The Russians have some lightly armed military police units they travel around in three four five vehicles and sometimes they are here sometimes they are there but there is no Russian significant military force on the ground There is no Russian occupation Frankly the Syrian government other than in a few bases in Qamishli and the city of Deir El Zoor has no real presence either There are a few outposts and a few patrols The people with the large tens of thousands forces on the ground is the SDF our partner against ISIS In December President Trump spoke of withdrawing from the North East of Syria and the Americans are there now How long will they remain We will remain there until we have completed our military mission of the enduring the defeat of ISIS Can we say it is an openended presence there I would never say the word openended I would say only what I have just said What would you tell your allies the SDF in advance before pulling out Pulling out of northeast Syria is not on the agenda as we have not seen yet the enduring defeat of ISIS Back to the current relationship between Washington and Moscow There were some talks between some American officials and Russian officials in Washington Moscow and Vienna Where are we in that regard Is the stepbystep approach still valid As you know we have various levels of talks with the Russians We maintain generally our radio silence on these talks One exception was when Mike Pompeo traveled to Sochi to meet with FM Lavrov and President Putin to talk about Syria and to talk about our efforts to get a compromised solution We laid the whole thing out to both Putin and Lavrov and we did a joint press conference with Lavrov It is all on the record What do you make of the Russian media criticism of Assad We think that Russia knows very well what is going on in the country We think Russia knows what sort of ally they have in the Syrian President And we think those articles speak for themselves Do you think the Russians are upset with Damascus I think the articles speak for themselves You are a journalist and when you write your articles you want us to read what you write Right Then believe what is printed in the papers Did the Russians convey the same thing with you We do not share the details of diplomatic exchanges with our valued Russian interlocutors We Know the OPCW report blamed Damascus for Ltamneh Hamah chemical attack in 2017 and we know that Damascus dined that What is the next step The OPCW is reporting its findings to the UN Security Council which were dramatic and talk not just about Regime forces using chemical weapons but that the decisions were taken at the highest levels of the government to do so Meanwhile the Security Council is also dealing with the UN Board of inquiry that found the regime and to some degree the Russians culpable for exploiting the UN is passing of coordinates of humanitarian installations that should be on a no strike list but in fact were deliberately struck We see the UN from OCHA Chief Mark Lowcock to SecretaryGeneral Guterres himself speaking out in very clear and tough terms of the humanitarian risks of closing these border crossings from Iraq and eventually Turkey and the failure of the regime to allow crossline transfers of humanitarian goods to those areas We see German courts pursuing Assad is torturers who had gone after Syrian citizens These citizens and their torturers now find themselves in Germany with cases open against them This is just the tip of the iceberg of all of the accountability efforts that we the UN the international community and the media are doing to expose that is the word I would use expose the absolute moral bankruptcy of that regime and those who are associated with it What about the UN peace process We hear UN special Envoy Mr Gier Pederson saying that he made a deal between regime and opposition about agenda of the constitutional committee Pederson has this account and we support him 150 percent including his call for a nationwide ceasefire We support his efforts to build on the agreement on the agenda That is a small but important step forward Do you think that it is realistic to talk about presidential elections under UN auspices in 2021 We think the elections are the right way to go If Assad holds his elections this year or next year they will have none zero international credibility They will be dismissed by the international community The international community will redouble its efforts to pursue real elections monitored by the UN That is the way forward That is what the US supports The policy that we are pursuing is not going to change We look very much forward to working with the media and the voices and people of the entire Middle East in speaking as one to call for a political solution and an end to the fighting It this realistic Some people think it is not realistic I do not know but two years ago people thought that it was unrealistic to think that the last citadel of the armed opposition in Idlib would hold out for very long Two years later there it is Some people thought it was impossible for the Syrian Opposition and representatives of the Syrian government could meet together in Geneva they have done so Trust us that we are not only pursuing this policy we think it has had some limited success and we think it has the potential to have a great deal more success

there are concerns that it and other Western Balkan countries failed to coordinate to counter the virus Short Url ABU DHABI In an interdependent world no country is an island where the whims and fancies of politicians can substitute for coherent policy and rule of law Few events in living memory have driven home this point more forcefully than the global coronavirus pandemic Yet in a forgotten corner of the world called the Western Balkans the precoronavirusera rules still apply At least that is the impression one gets from the goingson there The countries belonging to the Western Balkans include Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Kosovo Montenegro North Macedonia and Serbia Given their historical commonalities Slovenia and Croatia are included in the expanded definition following their entry in 2004 and 2013 respectively into the EU In retrospect as much of Western Europe found itself confronting lifethreatening challenges the Western Balkan states failed to get their act together The coronavirus calamities that befell the publichealth systems of Italy and Spain were clear omens of things to come But instead of responding to the approaching crisis in a coordination manner Western Balkan governments allowed old divisions to hold sway and business as usual to prevail With the secondlargest number of COVID19 cases in the region Serbia declared a state of emergency in midMarch President Aleksandar Vucic turned the crisis into an opportunity to cement ties with China by turning to it for assistance He justified his decision by claiming that the EU the longstanding partner of the Western Balkans had put a ban on the export of medical equipment While Brussels may have sent conflicting messages countries in the region remain eligible to order shipments of medical and protective equipment Another cause for concern is the rash of restrictions that Western Balkan governments have imposed on freedom of expression Harsh penalties have been introduced in a rush ostensibly to counter the spread of fake news and panic among the population The fines range from 500 542 to 2500 two to five times an average adult is monthly salary FASTFACTS Total cases in Western Balkans surpassed 15422 on April 26 No confirmed cases yet among refugee migrant populations Insufficient testing among vulnerable populations UAE sent medical gear to Croatia Serbia in late March Medical gear bought with private donations sent to Montenegro from UAE In Serbia journalist Ana Lalic was arrested for writing a report on the shortage of medical equipment and poor crisis management by one of the largest hospitals in the Vojvodina region I am convinced that I am doing the right thing regardless of my arrest and I can attest to that based on the positive feedback from medical practitioners I have gotten following the publishing of my article Lalic told the local N1 media outlet after her release People wrote to me with testimonies that the real situation is actually worse than what I wrote which is the saddest thing It is doubtful if foreign assistance can compensate for poor governance or shield the region from the pandemic is worst impact But at least the support of donors has been unstinting in the Western Balkans hour of need Regrettably some governments are using the need to combat coronavirus disinformation as a pretext to introduce disproportionate restrictions to press freedom Dunja Mijatovic Council of Europe commissioner for human rights In addition to Serbia China has shipped protective medical equipment to Croatia Bosnia and Montenegro Croatia alone has received 20 tons of Chinese medical equipment From the Middle East the UAE sent a plane with 10 tons of medical gear to Serbia in late March in response to Vucic is appeal The cargo included protective suits gloves shoe protectors masks sanitizers and ventilators Separately the UAE donated 115 tons of medical equipment including protective face masks to Croatia after the country was struck by the strongest earthquake in 140 years Turkey which has strong historical ties to the region has offered to support procurement of essential goods and sent a plane loaded with medical gear to Bosnia Montenegro and Serbia according to government officials The EU special representative to Bosnia announced a donation of 75 million to the country to which Norway is government will add another 640000 via the UN Development Programme In fairness Bosnian authorities have enforced precautionary measures such as curfews school closures and restrictions on movement of people But hope is in short supply with many people pinning their faith on overthecounter wonder drugs such as hydroxychloroquine To make matters worse medical assistance has predictably been divided up among the federation and the Serbdominated Republic of Srpska the two entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina This politically convenient arrangement is likely to leave the most vulnerable sections of Bosnian society without the necessary protective gear Dunja Mijatovic Thus far the lockdowns on public life have not translated into measurable success in any of the Western Balkan countries whose collective coronavirus caseload has been increasing at an alarming rate Equally troubling is the prospect of the relatively low rates of testing for infection masking the actual coronavirus picture The region is creaky publichealth infrastructure to say nothing of its crisishandling capacity is in no shape to flatten the curve of infections in the near future What the lockdowns have achieved for sure is to add to the misery of the most vulnerable people including migrants and refugees who are stranded in border areas with virtually no permanent housing or access to basic health care In Serbia for instance migrants and asylumseekers housed in staterun reception centers can only go out with special permission We fled from home to save our lives to escape war and now we are faced with this new coronavirus said Rozhan who together with her husband Ibrahim and her three children made the long and arduous journey from Iraq to the region in the hope of finding asylum in a European country UN agencies have been working around the clock with Serbian authorities to ensure the protection of the roughly 5500 migrants and refugees hosted in the reception centers According to the International Organization for Migration no COVID19 cases have been detected among the thousands of migrants and refugees in its reception centers across Bosnia and Herzegovina If the overall publichealth outlook is gloomy the portents for the region is economy especially the three countries that rely heavily on tourism Croatia Montenegro and Albania are even more so The pandemic has spelled the end of the summer tourist season before it could even begin thus delivering a body blow to their fragile economies The spillover effect of the tourism industry is collapse on other economic sectors is expected to decimate small and mediumsized enterprises leaving large numbers of people without jobs It is obvious that certain categories of economy and population will seek the state is support in order to recover from the damage caused by the epidemic Nemanja Nenadic Transparency Serbia is program director told a local news outlet Since there will not be money for everyone nor a completely objective criteria for determining who should be helped this will open a large field for trade in influence and corruption Even if some day a vaccine is found for COVID19 and life returns to normal across the world there is no guarantee that the Western Balkans body politic will be able to rid itself of the preexisting virus of corruption and favoritism In the worstcase scenario the looming publichealth disaster in the Western Balkans will be followed by economic humanitarian and governance crises rolled into one

market on March 24 2020 AFP The impact of the new coronavirus outbreak in Syria will be like no other across the globe The virus may already be spreading in the wartorn country where people have fled their homes to tents to escape fighting and where hospitals have not been spared the conflict The ravaged country has splintered into three regions that are controlled by different powers and different armies The country had been waiting the light at the end of the tunnel but is instead confronted with a different kind of threat a virus that has claimed the lives of thousands across the globe Experts have predicted that Syria is two months away from being devastated by the deadly outbreak Damascus which only recently registered its first virus cases initially spoke of respiratory infections that have claimed lives here and there The word coronavirus has not yet been introduced into its official rhetoric Several reasons make a coronavirus outbreak in Syria different than other countries 1 The government no longer controls all of the entire country It currently controls twothirds of territories and major cities but through Russian and Iranian power The remaining third located east of the Euphrates River is controlled by the autonomous Kurdish authority with the backing of the USled international coalition fighting ISIS Turkeybacked Syrian opposition factions control northern and northwestern Syria These three areas are all bound by a crumbling health sector In regimecontrolled areas doctors have fled from mandatory military enlistment or have sought a better life Those who remained were drafted in the military In areas beyond regime control hospitals have been destroyed by Russian and Syrian jet strikes 2 United Nations agencies are allowed to legally operate in Damascus where the government is based and not in oppositioncontrolled regions However the UN is restricted operation in the capital in recent years has turned it into a hostage of the regime is decisions and calculations which has consequently impacted the agency is work on the ground This has grown evident as preparations get underway to confront the coronavirus 3 The regime may have recaptured the majority of border crossings and airports but many still remain beyond Damascus control Crossings with Iraq and Turkey remain under Kurdish or opposition control This only complicates Syria is fight against the outbreak 4 The displacement of more than half of the population will create more challenges in countering the coronavirus More than 6 million have fled abroad while the rest are internally displaced in various overcrowded camps Other factors to consider are the economic crisis that have seen the pound trade at 1200 to the US dollar when it used to trade at 46 pounds to the dollar at the beginning of the conflict in 2011 Power outages also impact health work as do the American and European sanctions against the regime and figures and entities affiliated to it Damascus Arab and western isolation will only compound its struggle to fight the virus Amid these challenges the regime has sought to politicize the war against the coronavirus Moscow Beijing and Damascus have kicked off a campaign to lift sanctions off the regime China has yet to dispatch a plane with medical aid to Syria as it did with Italy Washington and western countries have started to release prisoners from jails in an effort to fight the outbreak The UN is divided Its workers in Damascus lean towards the regime and are leading efforts to lift the sanctions but they are not holding dialogue with the regime to urge it to be transparent in its handling of the coronavirus In effect these agencies are seeking to address an outbreak that has not been acknowledged by the official authorities Just days ago UN agencies held a coordination meeting but regime officials failed to attend Demands were made but the channel of communication to ensure the demands are met or even voiced is nonexistent The demands focus on sending aid to the whole of Syria and ensuring that they are granted access through border crossings But what about the actual health situation in Syria An internal UN report and another by London University painted a predictably bleak picture Countries have halted flights to Syria and border crossings have gradually closed over a period of two months Access at border points with Jordan Turkey and Lebanon remain open to aid and food trucks and humanitarian and UN workers General panic Inside Syria a general sense of panic has gripped the population and people have rushed to stockpile supplies All essential products are provided by the government in areas under its control That has not stopped the people from queuing at stores The panic does not stem from the lack of information from the government is end but from the fact that the people have no other choice The economic impact of the virus is another burden that will weigh down on the people where more than 80 percent live in poverty The price of bread and other essential products have risen and shortages have been reported Disinfectants face masks and hand sanitizers are in short supply and those available have seen their prices skyrocket Moreover estimates reveal that the whole of Syria boasts only 12000 hospital beds Some 2000 coronavirus test kits arrived in Damascus this week but the regime does not officially divulge such information Sources in Damascus revealed No resources have been allocated to fight the coronavirus because the treasury is broke The government refuses to allow international agencies to gather information about the health sector Furthermore people who have shown symptoms of the virus are afraid of seeking hospital treatment International experts in Damascus predict that the coronavirus outbreak in Syria will peak in May or June At the moment the people speak of a respiratory infection not coronavirus to avoid bringing up the issue of government response The government has imposed a partial curfew and has limited means to respond to the outbreak and handle its terrible social and economic impact said a western official in Damascus A total of 65000 people can be tested for the virus predicted the London University report The health care system will likely collapse when the cases exceed this figure No less than 5 percent of the projected infections will die Compounding this is a lack of awareness about the virus among the population Syria has recorded five cases of coronavirus so far but evidence points that the figure is much greater The government has suspended Friday prayers and banned gatherings shut schools restaurants sports clubs and reduced working hours in the public sector Just days ago Damascus placed 100 people in quarantine after they had arrived in the country from Iran the epicenter of the virus outbreak in the region Meanwhile Pakistan announced earlier this month that seven people who had arrived there from Syria were infected with the virus Baghdad announced two cases in travelers from Syria The London University report said significant evidence exists in regime areas of people who have shown severe symptoms of the coronavirus some of whom died Indeed Syria has registered a sharp rise in deaths from respiratory infections in people above 60 years of age Hospital workers in Damascus revealed they had received oral orders from intelligence officers to bury such reports with the dead to avoid raising any alarm in the media

initiative that aims to provide material support to the countries and regions that have been hit hardest by the disease The lack of a collective Arab response is not unique as it mirrors Europe is own systemic failure Exhibiting solidarity when it is financially convenient and turning its back sometimes on its own brethren when there are no economic incentives For example when Greece defaulted on its debt to international donors in 2015 Germany and other EU countries pounced on the opportunity to dismantle the country is major financial institutions and profit from Athens mounting miseries All the talk of European solidarity fraternity and community floundered at the altar of greed and unhindered profits That was not the first occasion the opportunistic EU had showed its true colors In truth Europe is united not by common history or unbreakable social bonds but rather by the shared belief that a united Europe is a stronger economic unit The same sordid scenario was recently repeated As Italy began buckling under the burdens of coronavirus it immediately and naturally sought the help of its European sister states to no avail Despite its sizable debt Italy is a major player in Europe is economic arena and even the world is It is the world is eighthlargest economy But the country is economy is now experiencing a rare freefall especially in the poorer regions of the south where people are literally going hungry The first country to come to Italy is aid was not France or unsurprisingly Germany but China followed by Russia then Cuba and others This palpable lack of solidarity among European countries has further empowered the already prevalent ethnocentric view on the continent that is championed by farright movements like Italy is League party of Matteo Salvini For years he has advocated against European integration It will take months if not years for the political fallout of the coronavirus pandemic to be fully assessed But what is already clear is that international and regional economic hubs are actively hedging their bets to consolidate their geopolitical positions in the postcoronavirus world Despite bashful American attempts to join the politically motivated international solidarity President Donald Trump is humble moves were too little too late In fact a sign of the times is that Chinese and Russian aid is pouring in to help the US which now has the world is largest number of COVID19 cases A compelling question however is where are the Arabs in all of this Italy and Spain in particular share historical and cultural bonds and broad political interests with many Arab countries interests that will remain long after the coronavirus is eradicated Failing to register on the radar of international solidarity with Italy and Spain will prove to be a strategic miscalculation Israel on the other hand has activated its aid agency IsraAID which previously worked in Italy between 2016 and 2019 after a major earthquake killed nearly 300 people and left behind massive infrastructural damage Israel uses such humanitarian aid as a political and propaganda tool Its missions are often underfunded and shortlasting but their impact is greatly amplified by a powerful official media machine that tries to project Israel as a peacemaker rather than a warmonger The truth is some Arab governments do in fact provide badly needed funds and aid to countries that are devastated by wars or natural disasters However these efforts are often disorganized and selfcentered and frankly not at all motivated by true solidarity That said the absence of Arab initiatives in the field of international humanitarian solidarity dwarf in comparison to the lack of solidarity within the Arab world itself Aside from empty rhetoric and useless press releases we are yet to witness a major collective Arab initiative Ramzy Baroud According to the UN there are 1014 million people in the region who already live in poverty according to official criteria and around 52 million undernourished A new policy brief issued last week by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia projects that an additional 83 million people are set to join the poor and undernourished masses throughout the Arab world as a result of coronavirus Aside from empty rhetoric and useless press releases we are yet to witness a major collective Arab initiative championed by the Arab League for example to provide an Arab equivalent to the many economic stimulus plans that have been put in motion in many other countries and regions around the world In March UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres issued a global ceasefire appeal pleading with the world especially warring Middle Eastern nations to cease all conflict and unite all efforts in a single war against the coronavirus Sadly that call has so far gone unheeded The war in Libya is escalating not subsiding Israeli killings of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank continue unabated and the flow of refugees out of Syria Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries is yet to slow down Times of crisis especially the kind that target all of us regardless of race religion or geography often constitute a wakeup call and present an opportunity for a new beginning a new social contract so that we may resurrect from the ashes of our collective pain to build a better world Let COVID19 be that opportunity which will allow all nations especially those in the Middle East to take a stand against war hunger and disease and extend the hand of solidarity to Africa and our historical allies

nations one small Levantine country in particular has its work cut out A revolution of the hungry people is convulsing Lebanon as food prices skyrocket and the value of the pound plummets trapping 68 million people between economic ruin and political chaos Almost every day demonstrators across the country are defying the COVID19 lockdowns to vent their fury over the worsening situation They are braving bullets to burn tires to block roads in protest against the ruling elites handling of the crisis To all intents the street protests that kicked off in October 2019 have made a comeback as people look for ways to make their voices heard despite the exigencies of the health emergency Some protesters in the capital Beirut have attempted to maintain social distance by holding protests in their vehicles and wearing medical masks A number of commercial stores and supermarkets on Monday joined Lebanons long list of shuttered businesses victims of the relentless erosion of peoples purchasing power The pound has been on the slide since October in tandem with a financial crisis that has driven up the prices of essential items beyond the reach of the average Lebanese Lebanese banks have responded to the challenge by setting an exchange rate that is more than 50 percent weaker than the currencys official pegged rate and locking depositors out of their USdollar savings A number of money exchange shops have been ordered to close for not abiding by the countrys Central Bank rules of selling and buying US dollars at 3200 Lebanese pounds The pound or lira dropped to record lows on the black market last week reaching 4200 to the dollar before currency dealers went on strike The dismal outlook has been made worse by the COVID19 outbreak the impact of which is almost impossible to estimate despite the precautionary measures taken by the government The governments uncoordinated and inadequate response to the pandemic has further eroded public trust in its ability to help people weather this pandemic and pull Lebanon out of its worst economic crisis in decades said Aya Majzoub Lebanon and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch HRW Months before the COVID19 outbreak the World Bank predicted that the portion of Lebanons population living below the poverty line would rise from 30 percent to 50 percent in 2020 Majzoub pointed out that the virus crisis and its associated shutdown measures were bound to further increase poverty and economic hardship She noted the direct link between the pounds loss of nearly half its value in April and the inflation rate which the Lebanese Ministry of Finance estimates will reach 27 percent in 2020 Social Affairs Minister Ramzi Moucharafieh admitted on April 14 that between 70 to 75 percent of Lebanese citizens now need financial assistance Majzoub added Earlier this month HRW had warned that more than half of Lebanons residents were at risk of going hungry due to the governments failure to implement a robust coordinated plan to provide assistance to families who have lost their livelihoods No sooner had authorities slightly eased the COVID19 lockdown measures than clashes erupted between protesters and security forces in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli As dozens of men smashed the fronts of local banks and set fire to an army vehicle the security forces responded with live ammunition rubber bullets and tear gas Amid the growing political tensions and economic hardship many suspect the small number of officially confirmed COVID19 cases in Lebanon conceals the actual picture I dont know what the future holds No one knows said Dr Naji Aoun head of the department of infectious disease at Clemenceau Medical Center in Beirut Seeing what is happening in Europe Lebanon is a small country so it may not apply to us It could be different on our scale But my thoughts go out to the Syrian refugees Who will take care of them Of Lebanons 59 million residents about 15 million are Syrian refugees the highest number per capita ratio in the world According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR the refugees socioeconomic situation is becoming increasingly dire by the day owing to income loss Nonprofit organizations are aware of the gravity of the situation but there are limits to what they can do You cant offer medical services as they wont be accepted in hospitals which is an issue Aoun said With no medical insurance or international aid the humanitarian crisis can only get worse he added This will weigh a lot on the refugees NGOs dont know what to do They dont have any resources and the government cant help them either because it is bankrupt They cant help their own people Aoun is one of the many health workers who have been devoting their time to treat patients often free of cost We need more support for nurses and doctors because we are going to get infected or bring the infection home with us This is what happened in Italy and in China so we need more support moral social psychological and financial from our government and our society Life is important to everyone and we are dedicating ours to help the community he added Dr Clara Chamoun a pulmonary sleep and critical care medicine specialist at the Clemenceau Medical Center said the situation across Lebanon was grim because the COVID19 outbreak had come amid a severe economic crisis It is harder to convince people that they need to stick to quarantine rules because they live on a daily basis she told Arab News We started from a place where we were already facing a shortage of basics And now we have got a huge hit due to a lack in ventilators face masks and alcohol solutions And theres no help Proper hygiene is especially difficult in refugee camps where overcrowding is common and access to basics such as clean water soap and detergents is not a given Those people arent going to be in contact with civilians in Beirut but they are in contact with each other and if one of them is infected it would lead to a rapid spread Chamoun said Earlier this month the UNHCR announced it required more than 30 million to cover Lebanons additional health needs due to the pandemic The funds would help expand the Ministry of Public Healths hotline capacity procure thermometers for detection hygiene items for refugees and protective equipment for frontline responders The plans also include establishing isolation shelters for 5600 people expanding hospitalbed capacity by 800 and intensive care units by 100 conducting 1200 diagnostic tests and arranging intensive care treatment for 180 refugees The UNHCRs program requires a further 55 million to meet the secondary healthcare needs both related to COVID19 and nonCOVID19 of refugees Aoun appealed for international solidarity in providing succor to migrants and refugees in Lebanon They may say its not their problem but the problem is getting worse No one will go blaming the international community nor the Lebanese authorities its a worldwide problem If countries have medication they will prioritize it for their people Europe closed its borders so they prioritized their own population but we cant do the same with the refugees he said With hunger poverty joblessness and a deadly pandemic staring Lebanese in the face Chamoun said the resilience of the people was the countrys only hope We have been through a lot already But this is truly the biggest challenge she said

international organizations sounded the alarm last week about the farreaching repercussions of the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic beyond its catastrophic health effects They have sent alarming messages that need to be heeded quickly While the media focus has been trained on the devastation the disease has wreaked on the US Europe and other wealthy nations that probably have the means to overcome the disease eventually and to mitigate its effects on other aspects of life the heads of the UN World Bank and International Monetary Fund IMF raised serious concerns about less developed countries The rapid spread of coronavirus highlights the worlds interconnectedness which means that if the disease becomes endemic in poor countries it could remain a constant source of outbreaks that would affect the rest of the world Similarly the devastation of poor countries economies would have spillovers on to their wealthier neighbors through the weathering of trade and investment opportunities The coronavirus recession could deprive developing countries of the ability to realize their economic potential and fulfill their sustainable development and climate change goals affecting the health and wellbeing of everyone on the planet Last Tuesday UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres launched a plan to counter the disease calling on everyone to act together to lessen the blow to people Earlier on March 23 he called in vain so far for a ceasefire in all conflicts around the world in order to help affected areas deal with this health emergency Guterres called the pandemic a defining moment for modern society He added History will judge the efficacy of the response not by the actions of any single set of government actors in isolation but by the degree to which the response is coordinated globally across all sectors for the benefit of our human family A UN report on the pandemic response listed some alarming statistics Up to 25 million jobs will be eradicated obliterating between 860 billion and 34 trillion in labor income a reduction of between 30 and 40 percent in foreign investment flows and a 20 to 30 percent decline in tourism around the world this year In addition the UN forecasts that 15 billion students will be out of school and 36 billion people will be offline The report calls for a largescale coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response of at least 10 percent of global gross domestic product GDP and warns that there is no time to lose in mounting the most robust cooperative health response the world has ever seen On Friday World Bank President David Malpass issued a statement expecting that the poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest and our teams around the world remain focused on countrylevel and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis Kristalina Georgieva managing director of the IMF added last week that the coronavirus pandemic has created an economic crisis like no other She said Never in the history of the IMF have we witnessed the world economy come to a standstill It is way worse than the 200809 global financial crisis In the US there are dire predictions that coronavirus could lead to the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s Miguel FariaeCastro of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis evoked great alarm in a paper he published on March 24 that projected a 321 percent unemployment rate for the second quarter of 2020 That would exceed the peak of 249 percent reached in 1933 during the height of the Great Depression These dire predictions may come to pass if stimulus packages are not implemented Or in the case of poor countries if no stimulus measures are adopted The US recently approved 22 trillion of economic measures to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the virus It is the largest such scheme representing more than 10 percent of US GDP However there could be a lengthy time lag between legislating these measures and actually realizing them For example the US package includes more than 300 billion of financial incentives for small businesses if they retain or rehire their workers but business owners complain that banks procedures are delaying their access to those funds The three global organizations called for regional blocs to supplement national and international efforts to mitigate the diseases effects Some of those groupings moved quite quickly to shoulder that responsibility In their March 26 virtual summit the G20 leaders pledged to work together to shore up the world economy and help poorer nations They committed to spending 5 trillion to stimulate their economies representing more than 6 percent of their collective GDP The challenge now is to turn those commitments into economic policy The G20 demonstrated its value in dealing with the 200809 crisis and it can do so again Saudi Arabia has an opportunity to use its convening power to drive this forward There could be a lengthy time lag between legislating stimulus measures and actually realizing them Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg Another example is the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC Since the onset of this epidemic it has convened regular meetings of the ministers of health from the GCC member states as well as meetings of finance and trade central bank governors and other officials and experts in those fields from our member states These meetings have resulted in very effective joint action to contain the spread of the disease across our region and lessen the socioeconomic impacts on citizens and residents GCC member states have also extended humanitarian assistance to other countries to help them fight the disease There is also a silver lining While dealing with the epidemic GCC countries and others are revisiting the way business is done and implementing better governance and more efficient management This is being done in all areas including sanitary measures and labor practices Business and municipal procedures are scrutinized Most importantly governments and citizens are realizing the importance of digitalizing commerce official business and education Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg

for Cuba to receive much attention in the news The days of the island being at the heart even a symbol of revolutionary fervor and superpower rivalry have long gone However every time there is a health crisis this small Caribbean island distinguishes itself with selfless readiness to heed the call to arms and sends its brigades of doctors and nurses to help those most in need while the wealthiest countries can barely look after the health of their own people For those of us who regularly visit Cuba and have become familiar with the legacy of the revolution the Cuban governments decision to send hundreds of doctors to combat coronavirus not only to its neighbors but to a total of 14 countries including Italy and Andorra in Europe came as no surprise Neither did the countrys decision to allow a British cruise ship with five confirmed cases of coronavirus on board to dock near Havana after it had been turned away from multiple ports in the Caribbean and the US Since the early 1960s when Cuba sent its first medical mission to Algeria to replace French doctors who had left the North African country after it gained independence from France medical help and humanitarian aid for the less fortunate have become part of Cubas DNA From the very early days of the Barbudos the bearded seizing power in 1959 Cubas two main paths to achieving social justice have been through investing in its education and health care systems This comes from a deep conviction that a successful society requires universal education and health services instead of these benefits being available only to those privileged enough to be able to pay for them And through the years the expansion of medical internationalism has evolved from a universalist humanitarian ideology to also being a source of influential soft power what became known as doctor diplomacy and a major source of income for the country bigger even than tourism or agriculture In its drive to improve the human condition Cuba followed the thinking of one of the leaders of its revolution Ernesto Che Guevara an Argentinian physician who declared in the early days of the revolution that we must strive every day so that this love of living humanity is transformed into actual deeds into acts that serve as examples as a moving force In a speech to Cuban militiamen in 1960 Guevara reminisced about his travels throughout Latin America after his graduation immortalized in The Motorcycle Diaries when as a young middleclass doctor he became acquainted with poverty hunger and disease with the inability to treat a child because of lack of money with the stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment to the point that a father can accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident as occurs often in the downtrodden classes of our American homeland This led him to leave the medical profession and become a revolutionary and on reaching a position of power to advance the cause of medical internationalism together with Fidel and Raul Castro and his other comrades Cuba currently has about 50000 doctors operating in 67 countries many in Latin America and Africa This is a staggering number and means there are more Cuban doctors working abroad than from all G7 nations combined even though the countrys population is only 114 million This comes with a financial reward which according to some estimates is about 6 billion a year For a country on the receiving end of harsh punitive sanctions from the US such an income stream especially of hard currency is a lifeline But it is far from the sole reason for Cuba maintaining its international brigades in white Moreover from a diplomatic perspective providing medical help to the developing world has helped to ease years of pressure by consecutive US administrations that have attempted to destroy Cubas revolution There has always been an element of defiance of the US in Cubas medical diplomacy while its domestic health care system stands diametrically opposed to the American model that neglects those who cant afford to pay for medical insurance Cubas drive to improve the health of the worlds underprivileged is complemented by its provision of free training for medical students including their accommodation and subsistence Students come from more than 100 countries chiefly in Africa Asia and Latin America as well as from disadvantaged neighborhoods in the US Two years ago during a visit to a hospital in Santa Clara I met among others two Palestinian medical students one from Ramallah in the West Bank and one from the Gaza Strip They had arrived in Cuba with no Spanish but soon became fluent and were by then preparing to return to the Occupied Territories to serve their people Part of the current US campaign to reverse the rapprochement between Washington and Havana that took place during the Obama administration involves vehemently criticizing what the Trump White House calls the exploitation of Cuban medical workers by their government The State Department tweeted last month that the Cuban government keeps most of the salary its doctors and nurses earn while serving in its international medical missions while exposing them to egregious labor conditions It is legitimate to question how much of what the Cuban government receives from its medical missions finds its way into the pockets of the doctors and nurses themselves but the US tweet reflects both the hypocrisy and the ignorance of an administration that is making a complete shambles of containing the coronavirus in its own country while doing nothing to help others In Cuba unlike the US there are no tuition fees for locals at any level of education and virtually no homelessness even if living conditions are very modest And as for the working conditions Cuban health workers are certainly prepared to work in the most remote and difficult conditions because that is exactly what Cubas revolution has taught them Hence it was Cuban medical teams that led the relief mission in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and were later in West Africa dealing with the 2014 Ebola crisis If the late Fidel Castro were able to witness the US criticism of Cubas medical internationalism he would probably repeat what he said to the judges in his 1953 trial before being sentenced to 15 years jail History will absolve me Yossi Mekelberg

themselves and protect their own citizens health and welfare The WHO declared the outbreak an international public health emergency on Jan 30 raised its global risk assessment to very high on Feb 28 and labeled the outbreak a pandemic on March 11 That is a snail is pace response to what was obviously a serious and aggressive pathogen Even more slow to respond were the G7 and the UN They are trying to launch international initiatives but their infighting bickering and discord only underscore just how divided and unprepared the world remains as it confronts the greatest threat to global public health in over a century The UN response finally coming together is to be run by the Office of the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs and aimed at 51 vulnerable countries across Africa Asia and Latin America Money will support the relief operations of nine UN agencies and their nongovernmental partners as they seek to deliver essential testing kits and medical supplies craft public

and offered reassuring language about the need for multilateral cooperation The G20 governments agreed to strengthen global safety nets but it is not clear where the effort will go next The Gulf

devastating impact on the livelihood of people and stresses that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit and must be helped The international community is having a difficult time organizing because of varying degrees of medical capacity and simply because of the scale of the pandemic Finally in wartorn countries COVID19 represents an even more serious threat to life Health systems have already been ravaged by violence and the threat of further strain on health care from the coronavirus is an enormous risk The pathogen is hitting hard in the most difficult places and the

organizations are focusing on conflict zones in a multidisciplinary manner Water and sanitation teams work to increase access to clean water in dozens of areas affected by crises including prisons Soap is included in the assistance packages given to families fleeing violence Since the COVID19 outbreak international health agencies are developing emergency plans to ensure continuity in the most critical hospitals around the globe This means increasing stocks of essential medical supplies and putting in place or reinforcing contingency plans and infection prevention and control measures in

22 2020as a precaution against the coronavirus AP PhotoBilal Hussein Short Url There is a famous quote that says Optimism is a moral duty I have pondered this quote in recent days when speaking to friends navigating various selfisolation regimes From one distressed lady who after 48 hours confined to her home told me she was ready to murder her nagging husband to others who have embraced this as a refreshing opportunity to detox from the pressures of their professional lives With experts warning that the pandemic may last for 18 months or more for the sake of our sanity and the sanity of those around us we must approach these challenges with positivity and optimism Fifty years ago quarantine meant absolute isolation from the world Nowadays we are spoilt for choice for virtual methods of communication I have spent so much time in touch with loved ones enjoying the pleasure of leisurely daily chats with my grandchildren Young neighbors have knocked on my door to check whether I need assistance We have rediscovered the wartime mentality of we are all in this together with everybody looking out for one another As previously unthinkable measures are enforced around the world it is just beginning to sink in how profoundly this crisis will impact our societies Those who are selfemployed or who have ad hoc sources of work are suddenly staring into the financial abyss A US survey found that half of small businesses could be wiped out within three months without urgent assistance Nations are faced with an impossible choice of either letting the virus run its course or indefinitely stifling the economy through draconian measures to slow the contagion Soon there will be a huge proportion of families who through no fault of their own cannot afford to feed themselves or are left drowning in unaffordable debt The crisis is already proving disastrous for cultural organizations and charities whose activities and funding sources have been radically curtailed This is where we discover what sort of society we really live in Do we hoard supplies and prioritize selfish interests or come together to ensure everyone is looked after My native Lebanon was already on the cusp of financial meltdown With it expected to default on a succession of loan payments and an International Monetary Fund bailout looking increasingly unlikely coronavirus is a further body blow The number of Lebanese living in poverty now exceeds 50 percent with the unemployment rate for under25s soaring above 37 percent Since September 800 Lebanese food and beverage businesses have closed ensuring thousands of further job losses With the virus is inevitable economic carnage still to be fully felt this is just the tip of the iceberg Meanwhile Iraq is hospitals are so dilapidated that those with coronavirus have avoided seeking care until it is too late Thus there are many recent cases of people dying immediately after being admitted to hospital complicating efforts to prevent the further spread of the virus In neighboring Iran where most Middle Eastern coronavirus cases have originated official statistics report that one citizen is dying from the virus every 10 minutes with research warning that up to 35 million Iranians could die Yet the authorities seem more interested in covering up the outbreak while continuing their regional warmongering and meddling Similarly Syrian hospital staff members were reportedly detained by the regime for leaking information about official attempts to hide the virus is proliferation The experience of many Gulf states has been radically different Bahrain has been the worst hit relatively with a rash of cases from citizens returning from pilgrimage to Qom However the authorities rapid response chasing down possible cases and thoroughly testing all those potentially exposed has for now stopped the spread of the virus in its tracks In one video I have seen Lebanese citizens living in Bahrain praised the stringent measures noting how safe they feel compared with other locations where the absence of rigorous testing or official transparency makes it impossible to comprehend the real threat level While most of us welcome drastic measures to keep us safe authoritarian regimes in states like Russia and China are arbitrarily expanding their restrictive powers In Israel despite losing the election Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is exploiting the crisis to keep himself in office and indefinitely shelve the corruption charges that could kill his political career and put him behind bars Do we hoard supplies and

Bringing results fast matters to many in the US and around the world Overseas America is drawing sharp scrutiny and analysis of exactly what happened to the American Dream Compassionate yet bold actions need to be taken immediately That includes the necessary task of continuing the requirement to practice social distancing It is surprising that many experts and pundits are actually shocked that many school classes will be held online through 2021 The projection of the spread of COVID19 in communities remains To be sure Capitol Hill is working on necessary urgent reforms but there is some permanence to the ongoing events But America in 2021 will be a much different country The disease spread in the US is a moral disaster where American values are being tested The broken protocols for mitigating the pathogen is spread are causing spikes in key states across the country States are now beginning to see more cases as a result of the Memorial Day holiday weekend which saw a breakdown of health protocols The outbreaks in the southern part of the country including Texas and Arizona have seen a resultant rise in the number of cases requiring hospitalization Other outbreaks are occurring in states such as Oregon also because of a relaxation of protocols States that have to close again will suffer more damage The local policy response in some parts of America is energized by the urges of the local community to help in this time of need which is one of the few positive developments It shows activism is working This activism will intensify over the summer As the US economy reopens there are new legal realities regarding liability a twist on public safety People being required to sign legally binding waivers before entering commercial establishments is becoming more commonplace The question is how much the pathogen will spread in these highly relaxed conditions with a varying array of protocols remaining in place for social distancing Clearly waivers are going to be common for the foreseeable future Waivers will leave owners liabilityfree in cases of pathogen spread giving theme parks live events beauty salons and doctors offices legal breathing space

COVID19 reveals how Iran neglects basis antiepidemiological standards and further violates human rights There is no province in Iran without a COVID19 case known also as the Wuhan virus Since February 20 when the Tehran regime reported to the World Health Organisation the first two patients who died on that day with a positive diagnosis the number of infected has increased to forty seven and a half thousand Sixtyseven per mille of the Iranian population has been affected by the disease It is the highest rate of contagion in the region from five to ten times higher than in Iraq Azerbaijan and Turkey which share the border The rate of virus transmission in the regional areas according to the official data has been slower But even the statements of Iranian officials contradict these optimistic statistics Every hour fifty people contract COVID19 and every ten minutes an ill person dies stated Kianoush Jahanpour head of the Public Relations and Information Center of Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran The official number of deceased has been on 3036 as of March 31 But the wellinformed Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran with headquarters in Paris informed that at least 16500 died During this epidemic death appears to knock at the door of Iranian households in almost every city with a large population It did not pass the city of Khorramabad capital of the Western province of Lorestan with four hundred and seventysix positive cases according to the official statics On March 8 a mother of three died in the in Ashayer hospital in Khorramabad A daughter learned about her passing after she called because no one informed the family Her brother had to pass the corridors of the departments for the COVID19 patients to pay the bills significantly higher than usual The preparation of the body for the funeral also looked much different and more painful for the family The ambulance driver who brought it to the morgue and the worker were visibly stressed One did not leave the vehicle the other only opened the door and stood aside Two brothers on their own without a protective uniform identified their deceased mother placed into the plastic casket and loaded onto an ambulance which transported it to the funeral home We had no choice we were not ready for it at all remembers one of the brothers There on their own they had to place the corpse into a refrigerator marked with Scotch tape It was only the beginning of traumatic experiences They paid five times more than usual for the grave and the protective gear for those who were preparing a body for a funeral The religious family was not permitted to have a clergy celebrant According to the health ministry only two or three persons could participate After family prayed together two cousins lowered to the grave The body was placed three meters below the ground level The state demanded to carpet the grave with powdered Lime and also to cover the body with it According to the Iranian tradition family member removes the fabric from the face of the deceased loved one But this time the family could not fulfill that custom I did not pull the shroud off the face of my mother What child could place the lime powder on their mother is face asked one of the brothers The tragic story is evidence that the Iranian regime may not be able to control the spread of the virus The unsupervised burial of the infected deceased with violation of the sanitary conditions is one evidence for it The family who lost their mother due to the COVID19 claims that the health authorities did not test them either but only recommended selfisolation The sadness of losing a mother is a cause for deep pain Perhaps those who are responsible for humiliating us will change after they read this story the brother stated After all we are also human beings Iran is GDP rate was 35 percent in 2018 according to the World Bank The fall in oil revenues was devastating for the economy based mainly on the hydrocarbon sector The political conflict with the United States over the Iran nuclear program ended with economic sanctions which caused calamity that triggered serious protests in Iran last year The Tehran regime claims about abundance at home about shortages abroad Astonishingly Tehran claims that the medical sector has sufficient resources Until today we had no shortages of beds nurses or doctors Even in intensive care units in most cities and provinces we have reserves stated Hassan Rouhani on March 25 according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran The officials claim that abundance of the medicines makes international humanitarian aid redundant But the Iranian opposition accuses the regime of lying While Iranian diplomats are complaining abroad about the shortages caused by the US sanctions although the economic targeted measures do not affect the medicines and food at the same time at home Tehran claims that it has sufficient supplies Iranians are victims of that doublelevel propaganda utilized by the Tehran regime Unlike the majority of the citizens of Western democracies they will not receive the equivalent of their salaries and their bills will not be delayed or canceled to sustain their lives They will also have to continue to bury their deceased loved ones on their own without any protection assistance

France Italy and the Netherlands this month signed a deal with AngloSwedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca that guarantees them a supply of up to 400 million doses of a vaccine against coronavirus should the company develop one Meanwhile Paul Hudson the CEO of French drug maker Sanofi last month pledged that should his company be successful in bringing a vaccine against the deadly virus to the market it would first be given to the US even before France There have been numerous similar attempts by the leaders of various developed nations to corner supplies of the promised inoculations for their own citizens in clear detriment to the rest of the world especially poor countries and the poor citizens of middle and even highincome nations Access to medicines and health care is one of the key barometers for measuring the rapidly growing inequality across the world today Indeed health is the third of the UNs 17 Sustainable Development Goals just after poverty and hunger That indicates the severity of the problem across the world According to the World Health Organization at least half of the worlds population lacks access to even basic health care This leads to millions of easily preventable deaths notably of infants children and women especially during childbirth Equalizing access to health care has long been one of the biggest challenges for all governments political leaders and international organizations At the core of the debate surrounding access to medicines is the issue of cost Currently the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world all belong to the developed nations and they enjoy a certain monopoly in their home markets allowing them to charge high prices In recent years they have lobbied hard and proactively resisted any efforts to cut prices even in the face of health care becoming unaffordable to many citizens of those countries as well as mounting social security deficits becoming the main headache of finance ministers in many European countries High prices and a protected market where there is no real competition from the cheaper drugs notably generics lead the Big Pharma companies to seek the rollover of patents with only minor tweaks that dont deserve any patent protection Notwithstanding their everincreasing profits Big Pharma firms have always defended their love for patents by saying that they invest billions of dollars in their research and development and that they need patent protection to be sure to reap the benefits of drug discovery While this may have been true at some point Big Pharmas ballooning profits over the past two decades have not just robbed them of their principal argument over high prices but also led to a serious global debate over the responsibility of the biggest companies for the sharp rise in unequal access to health care The blame for millions of preventable deaths in poor countries due to a lack of basic medicines has been laid primarily at the door of the drug manufacturers The debate resurfaced again when the coronavirus pandemic began late last year Health care experts have been warning that the pandemic which has managed to bring even the most developed nations to their knees would cause havoc in vast parts of the developing world This point was highlighted at a global meeting organized by the UK recently when leaders pledged 2 billion to fund the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus but with a clear precondition that the drug would be fairly distributed all over the world During the summit it was repeatedly emphasized that while the race to develop a vaccine was a crucial one a bigger challenge lay in making sure that the vaccine will be distributed globally to stamp out the pandemic as quickly as possible and avoid a humanitarian disaster where rich countries restart their economies while people in poorer countries continue to die At the virtual meeting hosted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson a funding mechanism was unveiled whereby rich countries would guarantee the purchase of drugs to allow poorer countries to get access to those medicines at an affordable rate Though this mechanism has been in place for a few years and had led to the creation of a market for a pneumococcal vaccine for lowerincome nations the challenge of access to health care has not really been addressed in any significant manner The gap in inequality in health care provision only increased up to the outbreak of the pandemic The situation has undoubtedly become far worse since as the global economy is set to shrink by nearly 6 percent While the rich countries have got their reserves to fall back on the poor and middleincome countries are likely to be entirely ruined by the economic shock the virus has delivered to the world In such a situation it becomes even more crucial for the developed world to ensure that the Big Pharma companies let go of their penchant for fat profits and that drugs not just for coronavirus but also many other communicable and lifestyle diseases are provided to the needy in order to avoid tens of millions of deaths Ranvir S Nayar is the editor of Media India Group a global platform based in Europe and India

highlighted the vulnerabilities and resilience of refugees around the world during a particularly challenging time as they face the health and economic risks posed by the coronavirus disease COVID19 Fortunately so far COVID19 outbreaks in major refugee populations have been limited at least according to the available data which might not tell the full story Major concerns remain about the potential for the virus to spread through crowded refugee camps and dense urban environments where many refugees live Many refugees lack reliable access to soap and water let alone any ability to maintain social distancing The young demographics of many refugee communities might mitigate the potential impact of COVID19 but many refugees already suffer from the health effects of a displaced life which could increase the risks of exposure to the virus The primary impact on refugees so far appears to stem from the economic crisis caused by the pandemic Refugees are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks They often work in the informal economy and are frequently the first to lose their jobs The loss of assets when they flee their home combined with the cost of escaping and often low incomes mean that many refugees lack savings Furthermore border closures and efforts to limit the number of potentially infected people entering camps have reduced services in some cases Refugees are facing an epidemic of poverty as well as of coronavirus The pandemic and its economic effects are exacerbating the challenges facing refugees and other displaced people The recent annual UN High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR Global Trends report showed a clear spike in displaced people over the last 10 years Todays public health and economic crises are layered on top of a preexisting displacement crisis However there are reasons for hope UNHCR other international organizations nongovernmental organizations and refugees themselves are demonstrating creativity and dedication For example modern technology is being utilized to communicate COVID19 awareness provide ongoing education despite school closures and build business skills to improve refugees longterm prospects UNHCR and other organizations have also worked to provide hygiene kits and isolation units to help manage the pandemic as well as increasing cash assistance to help refugees cope with the economic fallout And they are working to improve infrastructure to provide refugees with access to water and adequate shelter Some donors have stepped up to provide critically needed funds So important actions are being taken but there are still crucial steps that the international community can take to mitigate the spread of COVID19 among refugee communities and to help refugees cope with the economic impact Many organizations that work with refugees are already taking some of these steps but they need more support Plans for addressing COVID19 and the worlds economic recovery should take the needs of refugees into account National recovery plans and loans from organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund should include refugee communities Similarly plans to help refugees should include the host communities especially when refugees are commingled with host country citizens in cities and towns Addressing the public health and economic needs of host communities as well as refugees is a more practical approach to fighting the pandemic and helps to diminish problems that can lead to hostility toward refugees While advocates for refugees have expressed appreciation for the generosity of some donors there is a pressing shortage of funds to assist refugees and host communities UNHCR faces significant funding gaps and the UNs Global Humanitarian Response Plan has been less than 25 percent funded so far Enhancing infrastructure in camps and other areas that host large refugee populations would help to address immediate and longterm needs While infrastructure requirements vary by location improving water infrastructure adequate shelter and sanitation would go a long way toward improving many refugees health and economic opportunities Another key component of infrastructure is enhancing digital infrastructure this is immediately necessary to ensure continued education for refugee children during the pandemic as well as to support refugee entrepreneurship communication and skillbuilding in the long term Many countries have instituted border closures to help control the spread of the virus While this is an understandable policy it is important that countries continue to allow emergency supplies and humanitarian aid to pass through borders so they can reach vulnerable populations Plans for addressing the pandemic and the worlds economic recovery should take the needs of refugees into account Kerry Boyd Anderson Fundamentally refugees need durable longterm solutions Part of the spike in the number of displaced people is the result of protracted conflicts that make it difficult for refugees to return home Creative diplomatic solutions are needed to help address the root causes of refugee flows such as war and persecution The international community also needs to accept that return will not be an option for many refugees and consider expanding other solutions such as resettlement for the most vulnerable refugees to other countries and assistance for integrating some refugees into host countries These are only some of the potential solutions to help address refugees and host communities needs today These are big asks when the world is trying to respond to the pandemic and resultant economic crisis and donor fatigue is likely to increase It is important to remember that in addition to a moral imperative to assist the worlds most vulnerable people viruses spread wherever there is opportunity and a failure to address potential spread among refugees would also pose significant health risks to the broader public Kerry Boyd Anderson is a writer and political risk consultant with more than 16 years experience as a professional analyst of international security issues and Middle East political and

when a group of Greek tourists were visiting Bethlehem and Jerusalem The virus as usual arrived from abroad a transmission between cultures and through travel The news of the first cases of coronavirus in the West Bank echoed throughout the Palestinian Territories on March 5 when at the wellknown Angel Hotel in the biblical city of Bethlehem seven guests and workers tested positive that same day The hotel quickly became a quarantine center and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared a state of emergency for 30 days The health threat shuttered all businesses universities mosques and churches and stopped gatherings in Palestinian cities leaving some West Bank towns wearing a deserted look For the first few weeks the Palestinian authorities were testing on average between a few hundred and 500 per day said Weeam Hammoudeh assistant professor at the Institute of Community and Public Health in Birzeit University West Bank Testing is now being done at more than one site and a spokesperson from the ministry has said they can conduct 1500 tests per day According to Hammoudeh there is a shortage of ventilators There is about 120 ventilators in the West Bank and they are trying to increase that number to 250 she told Arab News But in the worstcase scenario the Ministry of Health said they would need at least 800 ventilators There is currently at least one designated quarantine and health facility in each district or governorate For Ramallah there is an eye hospital in the village of Turmus Aya which is being used to house patients When that is filled up they will expand it into one private hospital and use three hotels The testing kits have come from the World Health Organization WHO and tenders are out for more ventilators We are in contact with our friends in the world said Enas AlMuthaffar communications adviser for the PLO is Negotiations Affairs Department Our financial needs to face this pandemic are estimated at 120 million The budget deficit will double and the losses of the national economy will be huge We are studying the economic effects of this crisis with the World Bank and a team of related institutions and have begun preparing for the revival of the economy once the crisis ends On April 2 a new 5 million emergency operation was approved by the World Bank to help the West Bank and Gaza address the outbreak Stopping the wheel of the Palestinian economy has caused a fall of revenues into the treasury whether from local taxes and the taxes that Israel collects from Palestinian imports through Israeli ports said Ibrahim Milhem a government spokesman The Ministry of Finance is working on an understanding with Israel to pay dues and deductions from tax funds to supply the treasury in addition to borrowing from national banks until this pandemic passes While medical assistance is on its way there may be more trouble in store for the government Many Palestinian workers are returning from Israel for a number of reasons Layoffs lack of shelter fear of infection and desire to observe Ramadan with their loved ones which is due to begin on April 23 Some of them are likely to be viruscarriers given the intensity of the outbreak in Israel with more than 11000 confirmed cases as of Tuesday The Palestinian Territories which currently have 248 active cases are relatively unscathed This could all change quickly Initially Palestinian and Israeli officials had an understanding on the care needed for Palestinian workers who contracted the infection There are about 150000 Palestinians from the West Bank who normally work in Israel or in Israeli settlements They earn more in Israel than they would in Palestine and are hence vital to the stability of the West Bank economy Initially they were to spend a month or two in Israel and their employers were responsible for providing them with appropriate housing and then if they needed medical care But that is not what actually happened said Hammoudeh On March 25 one of the returning workers was left at a checkpoint for several hours by Israeli police He tested negative after being picked up by an ambulance from the Israeli side The incident prompted Mohammad Shtayyeh the Palestinian Authority prime minister to urge all Palestinian workers to return to the West Bank for their own safety Israel did not keep its promise for an organized return of workers to the West Bank said Milhem Some videos show the return of workers making their way through large tunnels under bridges used to run rainwater This makes it very difficult for the PA to have full control over the workers before they return to their homes and also to make sure they do not cause infection to their families According to Milhem the Palestine government has established medical clinics along the crossings with Israel to test workers and measure their temperature But because we do not have sufficient test swabs random samples were taken from workers he said Those who had high temperatures were put at inhome quarantine and they were kept under monitoring until their results got issued In the first weeks of March the hope was that Israelis and Palestinians would close ranks to fight a common enemy This is a global health pandemic and you would think this would be a time for cooperation to conquer it but that is not what is happening said Hammoudeh Abuse has continued despite the coronavirus There are still so many accounts of Israeli settlers spitting on Palestinians despite the present health risks Hammoudeh is opinion was seconded by Milhem who said Israel has taken this pandemic as an opportunity to double the burdens on the Palestinian people While Israel has not placed its citizens under stringent lockdowns the curfew and other restrictions on movement were lifted over the Passover holiday despite the rapid growth in cases according to local media reports Pointing to the long history of coordination between Israeli and Palestinian authorities a Palestinian political analyst said that the coronavirus is a security issue for Israel If the West Bank has a terrible outbreak it will not be contained within the Israeli state Why You have around 7000 illegal Israeli settlers living in illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem Already about 200 Israeli settlers in the West Bank are infected At the end of the day joint coordination will be needed The coronavirus also raises the issue of Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails On Thursday the Palestinian Prisoners Club confirmed that four prisoners had been infected with the coronavirus in the Israeli Megiddo prison This is an opportunity for us to overcome our political issues and treat them as humanitarian cases and receive Palestinian prisoners back

the announcement of a series of measures not just unthinkable in peacetime but barely imaginable even last week And we are far from alone maybe even slightly late to lockdown Although it remains too early to estimate the full effect of the coronavirus outbreak it is not too early to realize that the world is going through another defining moment which will divide our lives into the before and after like the Second World War or 911 What do we know so far We know that the virus is no respecter of regime rhetoric or region or of unevidenced conspiracy theories Democratic authoritarian or anything in between all are regarded the same by this silent murderer We know we need greater preparedness and collegiality States mostly put off until tomorrow the dreadful consequences of cost and alarm for events like pandemics which are predictable but uncertainly timed We are going to have to work more closely together noting who has handled things more effectively than others and learn from them with humility and accountability but without blame otherwise things will remain hidden We know that by and large humanity responds positively Lockdowns seem to be working because people are responding to them though exceptions still tend to prove the rule And sometimes humanity responds in a breathtaking fashion which suggests why we ultimately survive From the heroics of medical staff risking their lives and dying in fighting the disease to those who refuse to let isolation equate to being alone and sing their hearts out together from the balconies and rooftops of the world As of now we do not know the extent of the economic recession to come but it is likely to be historically unrivalled since the Industrial Revolution We do not know if states will recognize the urgent and growing demand for a coordinated international response The G20 could and should step up by the Riyadh meeting in November We do not yet know the impact on domestic politics around the world such as if the US presidential race will be determined solely by this crisis We do not know if authoritarian regimes will use the crisis to undermine freedoms still further citing health security as an excuse for the currently necessary tracking and surveillance or if they will be mellowed by the disaster and realize that transparency and freedom are better protections for the future Nor do we know how bad this will be for the poorest of the world but we can be sure we are going to find out From refugees to those living daily with weak health systems they fear that when the infection catches them there will be few places to hide What chance then of any success for the clear call of UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres this week for a worldwide ceasefire He articulated the fears of those in areas of conflict of the impact of the disease on the vulnerable the displaced on women and children But he also recognized the ability of a common fight against the disease to open doors for diplomacy He is absolutely right to do so Many politicians know the phrase a ladder to climb down when a point of stalemate has been reached and when a party dare not budge for fear of appearing weak At this point when everyone knows that a conflict has become even less understandable than when it started it is impossible for either side to win or has gone on so long that every avenue to settlement has become discredited a diplomatic search is mounted for such a ladder to climb down so that progress can be made and face saved If you truly want to end a conflict now is the chance and the virus is your ladder Guterres recognized the ability of a common fight against the disease to open doors for diplomacy Alistair Burt People all over the world will be urging take it In Libya recover the humanitarian truce Stop the onslaught in Syria In Yemen no one can win on the back of a broken people Israelis and Palestinians have been brought closer in dealing with the coronavirus A checkpoint is no deterrent so they could take the chance to move beyond the Washington announcement to something more inclusive And perhaps the US and Iran could both take steps instead of trading unending accusations and claims against one another If US sanctions are to be eased it would be essential for some genuine verified response from Iran to allow progress Both steps should be taken as their respective populations fear tomorrow more than each other The political differences in the region are real and not to be minimized but perhaps they could be put to one side as increasing numbers of families grieve from Texas to Tehran and virtually all points in between It is time to heed and act upon the secretarygeneral is call Alistair Burt is a former UK Member of Parliament who has twice

YORK The world is not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe the UN food relief agency chief told the Security Council on Tuesday via video link Noting that the global spread of COVID19 this year has sparked the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two Executive Director of the World Food Programme WFP David Beasley pointed to deepening crises more frequent natural disasters and changing weather patterns saying Were already facing a perfect storm As millions of civilians in conflictscarred nations teeter on the brink of starvation he said Famine is a very real and dangerous possibility Beasley painted a grim picture of 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse coupled with an additional 130 million on the edge of starvation prompted by Coronavirus noting that WFP currently offers a lifeline to nearly 100 million people up from about 80 million just a few years ago If we cant reach these people with the lifesaving assistance they need our analysis shows that 300000 people could starve to death every single day over a threemonth period he upheld This does not include the increase of starvation due to COVID19 Requesting assistance Noting that WFP is the logistics backbone for humanitarians and even more so now for the global effort to beat the COVID19 pandemic the WFP chief urged the Council to lead the way First and foremost we need peace he said He asked that all involved in the fighting provide swift and unimpeded humanitarian access to vulnerable communities and for coordinated action to support lifesaving assistance along with 350 million in new funding to set up a network of logistics hubs to keep worldwide humanitarian supply chains moving Beasley also raised the need for early warning systems If we dont prepare and act now to secure access avoid funding shortfalls and disruptions to trade we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months In closing he underlined that We do not have time on our side so lets act wisely and lets act fast Link between conflict and food security DirectorGeneral of the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO Qu Dongyu highlighted how the newly released 2020 Global Report on Food Crises report clearly links conflict and rising levels of acute food insecurity Against the backdrop that 135 million people in 55 countries experienced acute food insecurity in 2019 nearly 60 percent of whom lived in conflict or instability he cited Yemen as the worlds worst food and malnutrition crisis this year saying that the number of acutely foodinsecure people there is expected to exceed 17 million The FAO chief also drew a connection between livelihood interventions and peace processes spelling out that coherent actions are needed among humanitarian development and peace actors to address the root causes of acute food insecurity Flagged that the forecasts for food security in 2020 look bleak he underscored the importance of early warning and quick action to preempt food insecurity caused by conflicts While conflicts extreme weather desert locusts economic shocks and now COVID19 are likely to push more people into acute food insecurity Qu saw a ray of hope saying that by closely monitoring the evolution of these shocks we can rapidly intervene to mitigate their impacts Noting that widespread conflict and instability lead to food insecurity and that reducing or preventing conflict reduces and prevents hunger the FAO chief closed by saying We have mobilized our organizations in ways not seen since the foundation of the UN Fieldbased obstacles Former top UN humanitarian affairs official Jan Egeland now Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council appealed to the Security Council for help with fieldbased obstacles in reaching hungry people living in a wartime setting In my 40 years as a humanitarian worker I have never seen as many people displaced by conflict as now he said We see more longer crueler conflicts cause mounting hunger as families flee their homes their farms their fields and their livelihoods and they become dependent on the generosity on the hosts communities that themselves are in the precarious situation He elaborated that Burkina Faso has experienced a tenfold increase in forced displacement in just one year saying nowhere else in the world has such an escalation been seen To mitigate the humanitarian situation Egeland made five concrete tasks beginning with safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to everyone everywhere He also stressed

YORK The COVID19 pandemic is profoundly affecting peace and security across the globe the secretarygeneral told the Security Council on Thursday pressing the 15member body to use its collective influence to protect the millions of people either trapped in or fleeing conflict and already facing acute vulnerabilities The health pandemic has fast become a protection crisis António Guterres warned With more than one billion children out of school 135 million people facing starvation by yearend and healthcare workers routinely being targeted by violence these wideranging risks require an urgent and united response The highlevel debate convened by Germany as president for July follows the Councils passage on Wednesday of resolution 2532 2020 which demands a general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations on its agenda Trust eroded The risks are diverse the UN chief said Trust in public institutions is being eroded in places where people perceive that authorities have not addressed the pandemic effectively or have not been transparent about its impact As grievances become more entrenched the potential for instability and violence only grows In some places fragile peace processes could be derailed if the international community is distracted he said In Sudans restive Darfur region the pandemic has led to repeated extensions of the deadline for completing the Juba peace process Elsewhere he said terrorist and violent extremist groups see the uncertainty created by the pandemic as a tactical advantage In Somalia there is a risk that extremist group AlShabaab could increase its attacks while security forces by necessity focus on the pandemic COVID and the vote Many countries have had to consider how to move ahead with elections slated for 2020 while trying to manage the health crisis In the Central African Republic attempts to use the pandemic as a pretext to postpone elections planned for yearend are creating tensions Collective security and a shared wellbeing are under assault on many fronts led by a relentless disease and abetted by global fragilities Our challenge is to save lives today while buttressing the pillars of security for tomorrow he said expressing his support for the Council in any way possible as it carries out its essential part of the response Needs are vast growing Peter Maurer president of the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC said his organization sees firsthand how COVID19 is deepening fragility spiking humanitarian needs accelerating the impact of violence in conflict and reversing hardwon development gains It is clear that pandemics cannot be addressed only as a health issue Health care at gunpoint futile Sharing lessons for humanitarian response he said international humanitarian law must be respected in order to protect civilians from pandemics Countries where health services are destroyed stand little chance of fighting COVID19 Healthcare workers the first and last lines of defense must be protected he said stressing that resolution 2286 2016 will be fruitless if it does not result in meaningful behavior change on the ground Assistance and protection must be available to all those in need without threat of intimidation or manipulation Peoples needs are the only reasonable basis on which to respond he insisted and he called for the development of a peoples vaccine that will be equitably distributed to everyone Further he said the secondary impacts of the pandemic must be mitigated through the creation of safety nets and livelihoods and that humanitarian responses must reach the most vulnerable as failure to do so will only nurture the cycle of exclusion States also must guard against any rollback of civilian protections Exceptional measures taken to fight the coronavirus must be timebound and proportional to public health needs Overall he said responses will only be effective if there is community trust and engagement Health care at gunpoint is futile Broad understanding of peace security Heiko Maas Germanys federal minister for foreign affairs underscored the urgent need for rapid and safe humanitarian access during the COVID19 pandemic The Council must finally embrace a broader understanding of peace and security he said While the UNs founders may well have had artillery batteries in mind when they drafted the organizations charter Today we know a virus can be more deadly than a gun he said Today climate change affects more people than conventional weapons Closing our eyes to this reality means refusing to learn The United Nations must be equipped with effective capacities While resolution 2532 2020 was long overdue the Council nonetheless sent a sign of unity by endorsing the secretarygenerals call for

living normally with no real threats to their lives or livelihoods just a month ago Markets and restaurants operated day and night students attended their classes and medical staff visited special sessions to prepare for the arrival of the coronavirus disease COVID19 What the residents did not expect was that they would be forced out of their homes overnight in an effort to find safety from the Iranbacked Houthis who stormed various cities in AlJawf after the local forces failed to stop their incursions As the world grapples with the devastating effects of a global health pandemic the Houthis have increased their military operations with impunity This is despite international warnings of Yemens inability to cope with COVID19 should it spread The Houthis incursions into the northern provinces of Nihm and AlJawf pushed citizens out of their homes compounding an already delicate humanitarian crisis The majority of the newly displaced families are now scattered in camps hotels or temporary lodgings with relatives in the city of Marib The Houthis choice to enter these areas which were informally considered as safe zones for their opponents undoubtedly increases the chances of exposure to COVID19 and risks the lives of thousands if not millions in the process The displacement crisis began when families from AlGail and Hazm in AlJawf started moving out of their homes after seeing the Houthis exercise brute force toward their political opponents Residents reported that the Houthis executed youths from the local population including teachers and arrested or abducted a dozen others The Houthis also confiscated and looted private homes including those of doctors who work in AlJawf General Hospital as a coercive measure to secure their cooperation Given the chaos and uncertainty caused by the Houthis incursion children women and men fled their homes leaving all their belongings behind They walked through the desert for days without water food or access to medical care According to the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC and the Yemen Red Crescent Society 10000 families totaling 70000 people have been displaced by the fighting Yemens government estimates triple this amount These numbers add a significant burden to the local population of Marib and decrease hospitals capacity to deal with the virus pandemic Given the sudden Houthi incursion into these areas which had been unaffected by the conflict for the past four years local authorities and international organizations were not ready to face the influx of displaced people Moreover the amount of assistance they received was scarce and there is an acute shortage of food shelter and assistance In an interview with Belqees TV Jameel Qassem the director of the administrative unit for internally displaced affairs indicated that although organizations claim to give aid to families they dont accurately calculate the number of family members So for example if there is a family of seven in need of urgent care they would receive only two or three blankets and mattresses which obviously do not cover everyones needs Moreover many displaced people seek to stay with friends and family to avoid living in the camps which overburdens host communities and deprives the displaced of aid because they fall off the assistance grid Qassem added that the Houthis are controlling access to AlJawf and are attempting to confiscate the assistance designated for the displaced families and redirect it to the capital city of Sanaa This politicization and manipulation of aid is a regular punitive tactic that the Houthis exercise in areas that oppose them irrespective of the humanitarian need The fighting has complicated efforts to help those in need of medical help including patients who need testing for the coronavirus Medical workers were unable to gain access to AlJawf as the Houthis prevented their entry A Yemen Red Crescent Society ambulance that was necessary for a medical evacuation was unable to enter the area due to the lack of safe access The ICRC reported that it failed to supply the AlJawf hospital with surgical and medical supplies All this puts significant strain on a society that is bracing for the pandemic UN Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has attempted to engage the parties in a nationwide ceasefire to lessen the suffering and end the displacement He made a statement last week urging a return to the political process that is aimed at comprehensively ending the war adding This process further aims to foster joint efforts to counter the threat of COVID19 Unfortunately a ceasefire is not good enough at this stage It will be impossible to mitigate the effects of COVID19 if people cannot stay at home Returning these 10000 families to their homes immediately and providing them with protection needs to be the highest priority of Yemens government and the international community Any other scenario that fails to prioritize returning the displaced

coronavirus disease in Sanaa Yemen March 17 2020 The daily traumas created by the seemingly random character of the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic stretching from sophisticated crowded cities in the US to bursts of new cases in migrant worker dormitories throughout Asia and Africa force a global realization that infection and death may emerge without warning For some time now it has been speculated that Yemen would suffer a far greater COVID19 crisis than other nations even those of similar poverty and lack of health infrastructure The reasons were given as the particular poverty of Yemen in clean water supply and distribution devastations caused by five years of warfare and consequent blockages of food medical and humanitarian supplies and exhaustion from years of battling with previous disease attacks from dengue fever to cholera Yet so far although Yemen has been so ravaged the total cases at the time of writing numbered only 1526 and the deaths per million amounted to only 12 Yemen was relatively late to this attack Until April 19 only one case was registered by June 7 the number was 482 multiplying threefold to the present day Given the world averages of 1648 cases per million and 728 deaths per million Yemen is record so far looks less hopeless than is acknowledged in the Western media And it is time to strike a note of hope for as measured by registered infection and mortality cases the region as a whole has been far less devastated than much of the world This needs some detailing If we take the nations bordering Yemen Oman and Saudi Arabia and those nations most proximate to the Arabian Desert Jordan Syria Iraq Kuwait and Bahrain then these eight countries containing some 138 million people provide clear evidence of an emerging demographic and locational advantage over wealthy regions such as Europe or the US with their much higher levels of contagion and mortality At the time of writing these two richest regions of our world have suffered about 65 million cases of COVID19 with a mortality rate deaths as a proportion of cases of 58 percent compared to a world average of 44 percent Omitting the two richest continents the mortality rate of the rest of the world is 29 percent exactly half that of the rich nations This is a global statement that measures the difference by and large between rich and poor suggesting that presently poor nations fare far better than rich nations in a stark COVID19 world Our big data on the Arab Middle East reinforces this but also points to the reasons behind what seems to be a counterintuitive global trend Given their superior incomes and health systems their huge transport medical and knowledge infrastructures and their enormous governance administration and policy systems why do the rich do so badly At the time of writing our eight nations had registered about 450000 cases of COVID19 since its arrival in Iraq Kuwait Oman and Bahrain in late February In total the group averages 382 deaths per million about half the world average and a mortality rate of 47 percent which is about 80 percent of the world average But there is much more to it than this Of the eight nations the four poorest Yemen Iraq Jordan and Syria together have an average per capita income of 8100 at purchasing power parity compared to about 54000 for the four wealthiest This tremendous income disparity within the group aligns directly with the COVID19 statistics The poorest four nations average 19538 cases and 22 deaths per million compared to the richest four is 92676 cases and 54 deaths per million So within this Middle Eastern group of eight nations extreme poverty does not mean disaster in terms of COVID19 cases or mortality in fact it means quite the opposite The poorest nation of the group Yemen where we began with its starvationlevel per capita income of 2600 has a deathspermillion people figure of nine to 12 and it has hovered around that level for a month or more Kuwait the richest nation with an income per capita of 73000 has 90 deaths per million people Saudi Arabia is by far the largest nation of this group and it is the second richest it has reported more than 230000 cases and 63 deaths per million people These figures really do show a difference between rich and poor and lead to conclusions that seem far from global common sense Rich especially small and rich nations should have a multitude of advantages in facing the COVID19 invasion from sheer income effects associated strongly with good food and health to high levels of public expenditure on the miscellany of infrastructure that should have become weapons against virus attack So what is the explanation The key lies in age distributions The poorest nations have the largest number of young people and the smallest numbers of older people in their populations With increased incomes especially when this is part of a transition from real poverty to reasonable sustenance richer countries older folk eat better and live longer The COVID19 virus leaves young folk mostly unharmed but does fasten on to the elderly who are more likely to die of infection As poor nations have far more young people and far fewer old people then they also have far less infection and much less mortality This is measured precisely in the data for our eight nations The four poorest have an average of more than 38 percent of their populations in the 014 age group while the wealthier four have only 22 percent This alone would explain most of the divergence in COVID19 experience between them At a global level the 19 wealthy nations with the highest virus incidence and mortality have an average of only 18 percent of their populations in the 014 age group Whereas the eight Middle Eastern nations have only 31 percent of their populations in the 65plus age group the same 19 richest nations have 176 percent of their population in that older group This explains most of the COVID19 differences between the eight nations and the richer nations of the world Extreme poverty does not mean disaster in terms of COVID19 cases or mortality in fact it means quite the opposite Prof Ian Inkster Wealth and its associated institutions clearly do not compensate for this stark demographic factor Thus if we match the eight Middle East nations against the UN Human Development Index HDI where globally the highest nation on the index is rated 094 out of 1 then we find that our four poorest nations rank on average about 05 and our four wealthier nations rank about 08 The HDI is designed to capture income and social infrastructure in its ranking and it now seems clear that within these eight nations a higher HDI ranking provides no insurance whatsoever against the COVID19 virus The outcome of this statistical exercise is very hopeful certainly optimistic For the eight nations as a whole relative lack of wealth and social infrastructures is being compensated for by the age distributions of their populations This is a principal explanation of low incidence and mortality of COVID19 in comparison to wealthy regions such as Europe and North America But within the group the four poorest nations show the most exaggerated age distribution effects and so shall probably weather the storm of COVID19 marginally better than their wealthier neighbors Prof Ian Inkster is a global historian and political economist

joint Russian and Turkish patrols in Idlib on March 15 2020 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday had a phone call with Turkey is Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss ceasefires in Libya and Syria in the light of the dangers posed by the coronavirus pandemic This is a very positive sign that when facing the same threat which does not differentiate between nations ethnicities or religions warring parties can put their differences aside and cooperate instead of confronting one another The theme of the discussion between Trump and Erdogan chimed with the call of UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres who last week called on nations and groups around the world to lay down their arms and fight the common enemy However beyond answering Guterres humanitarian call for a ceasefire there are pragmatic reasons pushing the US and Turkey to bridge their differences First of all both Turkey and the US just like every country around the globe are trying to adapt and manage the coronavirus crisis Facing a staggering number of virus cases that will require hospitalization likely overwhelming every health system on the planet as well as the prospect of a recession going into a depression the game of geopolitical influence becomes secondary for most leaders There is an urgent need for stability especially concerning Syria Both leaders understand that if they allow Bashar Assad to take Idlib this will result in another wave of violence that could extend beyond the northern Syrian province Neither the US nor Turkey are ready to manage that They know that the people in Idlib will not surrender Fending off Assad is offensive will also keep the internally displaced people in Idlib and prevent another wave of migration at least for the moment Idlib is the last enclave of the Syrian opposition They are unlikely to reconcile with Assad who in turn will not show any grace or mercy to his staunchest enemies Therefore there will not be a settlement similar to the one in Daraa which was retaken by the regime with a controlled level of violence In Idlib the situation will likely spiral out of control and the flow of refugees will not be manageable The March 5 agreement between Russia and Turkey was concluded in large part because neither the Russians nor the Turks have a solution for the flow of refugees Today handling 1 million refugees in the light of the coronavirus crisis is a nightmare no party wants to undertake The silver lining behind the pandemic is a change in the perspective of world leaders who will now be more ready to compromise in order to secure stability In the face of the crisis created by coronavirus they cannot handle any further uncertainty in foreign affairs They cannot risk more carnage in Syria With this in mind the US which has a lovehate relationship with Erdogan is now joining forces with Turkey in an attempt to stabilize Idlib Although Congress passed a resolution condemning Turkey is incursion into northern Syria in November last year Special Envoy to Syria James Jeffrey last month announced that the US is working with NATO and the EU to ensure Turkey gets the support it needs in Idlib Washington which canceled the sale of fighter jets to Turkey because the latter acquired the S400 missile defense system from Russia is now proposing to sell Turkey its Patriot missiles if it does not use the S400 Even the Russians who were the patrons of the offensive that started three months ago found the task overwhelming and entered into the March 5 ceasefire agreement with Turkey to limit the bloodshed The US support of Ankara will probably make the ceasefire more enduring However violence in the northwest could spill over all around the country The southwest which was recaptured by Assad two years ago is boiling One media outlet has described the province as being like glowing embers amid the ashes that could reignite at any time Discontent is high and the various armed factions have formed a division that is supposedly now part of the proregime forces but has a tense relation with Damascus Meanwhile the economic conditions are dire all over the regimecontrolled territories and Assad is unable to provide basic services to citizens Hence the situation threatens to descend into another round of violence Handling 1 million refugees in the light of the coronavirus crisis is a nightmare no party wants to undertake Dr Dania Koleilat Khatib On Monday China is envoy to the UN called for the lifting of sanctions against Syria mentioning the current pandemic and Guterres call to cease hostilities However the US and Europe do not seem to be responsive A lifting of the sanctions would not mean relief for the Syrian people but further empowerment of the regime It would also mean enabling Assad to complete his goal of recapturing all of Syria by force On the contrary Washington is seeking to speed up the enforcement of the socalled Caesar Act which imposes sanctions on individuals and entities dealing with the current Syrian regime If Russia joins the US and Turkey in their quest for stability in Syria it might put pressure on Assad to make some concessions particularly accepting that international aid organizations should be able to deliver relief to the Syrian people without any interference from his forces The regime has been very intrusive in the work of relief organizations and large chunks of aid often find their way into the pockets of regime profiteers So an agreement between Turkey and the US if followed by an understanding with Russia could help contain Assad and establish some stability in the short to medium term Dr Dania Koleilat Khatib is a specialist in USArab relations with a focus on lobbying She holds a PhD in politics from the University of Exeter and

was going to write about national day celebrations in America last week in the shadow of our health social political and economic crises However there is an urgent Syria humanitarian file that will reach decision at the United Nations this week that must be my priority On July 10 the United Nations Security Council resolution that permits delivery of humanitarian assistance from Turkey into Idlib will expire The Security Council must vote in favor of a new resolution in order for the United Nations to continue to coordinate the delivery of the aid Now about three million Syrian civilians in Idlib receive food and medical supplies through two border crossings from Turkey under the supervision of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral Guterres and many countries support an extension of the program and also the reopening of a border crossing in Hassakeh for the delivery of medical supplies there to contain the coronavirus The humanitarian situation in Syria is deteriorating According to the United Nations humanitarian aid office food prices have tripled this year The number of Syrians in all the country who need food assistance has grown from 79 million to 93 million this year The coordinator for the United Nations humanitarian assistance program Imran Riza said at the end of June that malnutrition is becoming worse and worse including among children In addition to the food is a crisis there were 372 coronavirus cases recorded officially in all of Syria on July 6 The World Health Organization said in reality the true number is certainly much higher and even the official numbers are now growing fast There are shortages of medical supplies and testing equipment so containing the virus will be very difficult in the best circumstances In Brussels on June 30 twentysix countries pledged another 77 billion dollars for humanitarian aid to Syria Moscow didnt participate in the conference and it didnt give new humanitarian assistance but it wants to direct who receives the aid Russian diplomats in New York are threatening to halt the United Nations program to deliver vital supplies into Idlib Moscow prefers that all the humanitarian assistance go through the United Nations center in Damascus where the Syrian government could control which towns receive aid and which towns receive nothing The Russian efforts to strengthen Syrian government control of all humanitarian aid is part of Russias diplomatic campaign to normalize the Syrian governments political and economic relations with the Middle East and Europe Moscow wants Damascus to be the only Syrian partner for all assistance and reconstruction issues Moscow also wants to bring down isqat the Western sanctions on Syria It claims Western sanctions impede humanitarian assistance to Syria It is true that despite claims by Washington and Brussels the sanctions in reality do deter some banks from undertaking any project financing in Syria including purchase of humanitarian supplies The bureaucratic routine to obtain exceptions from the sanctions is long and uncertain But as journalists officials from the United Nations and nongovernment organizations have explained in detail the biggest humanitarian aid problem is Syrian government manipulation and corruption If Russia stops the UN delivery program from Turkey into Idlib it wont be sanctions that stop new aid to Idlib it will be Syrian government actions Already there are reductions in delivery of medical supplies into Hassakeh because the Russians succeeded last December in halting the UN program at the Yaroubiyeh border crossing from Iraq In New York this week Washington should have a simple message if Moscow uses its veto to stop an extension of the UN coordination of aid into Idlib all American aid to the UN program in Damascus will stop I hope Washington is urging Europe to give the same message to Moscow Russia would then be responsible for feeding the roughly six million who live under Assads control who need assistance US and European aid could focus on Idlib and the five million Syrian refugees outside Syria If Russia will not concede the Americans and Europeans will have to replace the coordination and logistical role that the United Nations plays in Idlib This will be difficult but it is possible with time and Turkish help The Americans and Europeans must start preparing now because the Russian pressure will not end They also need empowered offices that can issue exceptions to the sanctions in order for humanitarian organizations to buy supplies quickly And they need to work with humanitarian organizations to establish a reliable project monitoring mechanism under protection of the Turkish military in Idlib The Syria crisis will not end in 2020 and we need to consider how to preserve the humanitarian aid program from Russian attack

whose sole aim is to maximize their own interests in the international arena to set aside their foreign policy goals even in times of crisis such as this Indeed crises tend to have significant effects on the domestic and foreign policies of nations It is therefore unrealistic to expect governments to institute foreign policy lockdowns in the way that they have done so domestically This would be especially difficult for Turkey where barely a day passes without a new development in both domestic and foreign affairs It is therefore worth taking a closer look on what is happening in the foreign sphere in the shadow of the coronavirus disease COVID19 Syria Libya the Eastern Mediterranean and the issue of Turkey is Russianbuilt S400 missile defense systems are all ensuring the Turkish Foreign Ministry will remain busy throughout and after the pandemic In a message posted on Twitter last Monday Turkey is Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said that foreign policy matters are not being ignored during the pandemic Our government continues to be focused on the coronavirus challenge at home and abroad but we are also working on foreign policy matters such as those in Syria Libya and the Aegean Sea he wrote As President Recep Tayyip Erdogan indicated the Syrian regime is trying to take advantage of the situation The foreign ministers of Turkey Iran and Russia held a teleconference on Wednesday as part of the seventh foreign ministerial meeting of the Astana process They discussed the latest developments in Syria particularly in Idlib province and east of the Euphrates River amid growing concern about the future of the fragile ceasefire in the former region Discussed fight against COVID19 pandemic in the context of Syria Turkey is Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu wrote on Twitter after the meeting Reviewed recent developments particularly in Idlib and East of Euphrates political process humanitarian situation and return of refugees The meeting followed intense diplomatic exchanges between the three Astana guarantors at the presidential level Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation late on Tuesday with a special emphasis on Syria A presidentiallevel summit under the Astana process had been planned but was postponed due to the spread of the coronavirus Meanwhile Turkish and Russian military forces carried out another joint patrol along a key highway in northwestern Syria on Tuesday Fifth combined TurkishRussian land patrol was conducted today by air and ground vehicles on M4 motorway in Syria is Idlib province as part of the earlieragreement according to a tweet by the Turkish Ministry of National Defense The situation in Idlib remains uncertain and fragile however and developments there in the weeks and months ahead will have a big effect on the future of the Astana process Erdogan on Monday accused the Syrian government of taking advantage of the fact that the world is distracted by the pandemic to increase attacks in Idlib Another area of Turkish foreign policy for which the future remains uncertain is the situation in wartorn Libya There are two main sides in the war The Government of National Accord and military commander Khalifa Haftar Their conflict was escalating before the pandemic and while the world has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by the coronavirus crisis and its consequences it has continued to do so This has diverted the attention of foreign policy experts from the global pandemic in particular when Turkish jets took off from military bases in Konya and Incirlik bound for the Eastern Mediterranean and Libya This raised questions about the possibility of a military operation in the country Hours later however Turkey is Ministry of National Defense announced that the Turkish Armed Forces had conducted an unannounced aerial and naval exercise in the Eastern Mediterranean It remains to be seen how the situation in Libya where Turkey is actively involved will unfold in the weeks ahead The other issue dominating the Turkish agenda is the S400 missile defense systems According to a report by Reuters plans to activate the new Russianmade systems have been delayed by the pandemic but Ankara does not intend to reverse its decision which has raised the threat of the US sanctions As the pandemic continues around the world the hopes that guns might fall silent in wartorn countries have been dashed by the escalation of the conflicts in Syria and Libya Sinem Cengiz Reuters quoted a senior Turkish official as saying the delay could last for several months because of technical issues However Erdogan stated that the delay should not be viewed as a change of heart The S400s are now our property All parts have arrived and the systems will become operational in April the president previously told journalists after he met Putin in Moscow on March 5 As the pandemic continues around the world the hopes that guns might fall silent in wartorn countries have been dashed by the escalation of the conflicts in Syria and Libya As a result it seems Turkey will be unable to take a step back from these battle zones Sinem Cengiz is a

coronavirus reaches the besieged Gaza Strip While this issue is of great concern for all Palestinians living under Israel is military occupation the Gaza situation is particularly complex and extremely worrying More than 50 countries have already reportedcases of COVID19 If developed countries such as Italy and South Korea are strugglingto contain the deadly virus one can only imagine what occupied Palestinians would have to face should it strike them In fact according to official Palestinian reports coronavirus may already have reachedPalestine thanks to a visit by a South Korean delegation between Feb 8 and 15 which included tours of Jerusalem Nablus Jericho Hebron and Bethlehem Nine members of the party were later confirmed to have contracted coronavirus The Palestinian Authority PA scrambled to contain the fallout of this news which caused palpable panic among a population that had little faithin its leadership to begin with Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said We hope that the owners of the unknown facilities visited by the Korean delegation have a sense of responsibility We call on them to inform the authorities concerned and abide by the instructions The Ministry of Health followed this by declaring a state of emergency in all hospitals under PA jurisdiction in the West Bank and designating a quarantine center near Jericho for those arriving from China and other areas that have been hard hit by coronavirus For Palestinians however fighting an outbreak of coronavirus is not a straightforward matter even if the dysfunctional PA facilities followed the instructions of the World Health Organization WHO to the letter Palestinians are separated by an Israeli matrix of control which has left many communities stranded behind large walls military checkpoints and impossibletonavigate army ordinances that are designed to weaken the Palestinian community and ease the Israeli government is mission of controlling Palestinians and colonizing their land What can the PA do to come to the aid of tens of thousands of Palestinians in the socalled Area C of the West Bank This region is entirelyunder the control of the Israeli army which has little interest in the welfare of its Palestinian inhabitants Such questions would have to be considered in the context of what WHO refersto as health inequalities among Palestinians on the one hand and between Palestinians and privileged illegal Jewish settlers on the other In some ways many Palestinian communities are already quarantined by Israel but for political not medical reasons An outbreak of coronavirus in any of these communities especially the ones cut off from proper health care would prove disastrous However the worst fate would await Gaza should the deadly and fastspreading virus find its way through the hermetic siege that engulfs this minuscule but densely populated region Gaza which is enduring its 13th year of Israeli siege and is still reeling from the mass destruction of several wars has already been brandedunlivable by the UN However the misery of Gaza never ceases to worsen Not a single UN report on Gaza is ailing medical facilities or preparedness has for at least the last 10 years used any positive or even hopeful language Last March UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Territories Jamie McGoldrick bemoanedGaza is chronic power outages gaps in critical services including mental health and psychosocial support and shortages of essential medicines and supplies In January the Israeli rights group BTselem reported an unprecedented health crisis in besieged Gaza one that is not fueled by coronavirus or any other such epidemic but by the fact that the Strip is barely functioning hospitals are desperately trying to deal with the fallout of the thousands of injuries resulting from the Great March of Return BTselem last year reportedon the unlawful openfire policy Israel is using against these demonstrations Allowing soldiers to shoot live fire at unarmed protesters who endanger no one has led to horrific results And in January the Israeli group citedmoderate estimates provided by the WHO that by the end of 2019 Gaza physicians had to perform limb amputations on 155 protesters including 30 children This is in addition to the dozens of protesters who have been paralyzed because of spinal injuries This is only a small part of a multifaceted crisis Not only have measles and other highly contagious diseases foundtheir way back into Gaza but waterborne diseases are also spreading at an alarming rate As much as 97 percent of all Gaza is water is not fit for human consumption according tothe WHO which raises the question How could Gazan hospitals possibly confront coronavirus when in some cases clean water is not even available in its largest hospital AlShifa Even when it is available doctors and nurses are unable to sterilize their hands because of the water quality according tothe RAND Corporation The WHO is Palestine director Gerald Rockenschaub spoke assuredly about his meeting with PA Health Minister Mai AlKaila in Ramallah on Feb 23 when they discussed the need for more preparedness measures and additional priority preparedness actions in the West Bank and Gaza The organization also announced that it is coordinating with local authorities in Gaza to ensure the Strip is preparedness to cope with coronavirus Gaza is hospitals are as dysfunctional as ever its water is as dirty as ever and despite repeated warnings the Strip is still unfit for human habitation Ramzy Baroud Such soothing language however masks an ugly reality one that the WHO and the entire UN have failed to confront over the course of a decade All previous reports on Gaza by the WHO while accurately detailing the problems have done little to acknowledge their roots or fashion any permanent solutions Indeed Gaza is hospitals are as dysfunctional as ever its water is as dirty as ever and despite repeated warnings the Strip is still unfit for human habitation thanks to the brutal Israeli siege and the silence of the international community The truth is no amount of preparedness in Gaza or frankly anywhere in the Occupied Territories could stop the spread of coronavirus What is needed is a fundamental and structural change that would emancipate the Palestinian health care system from the horrific impacts of the Israeli occupation and the Israeli government is policies of perpetual siege and politically imposed quarantines also known as apartheid Ramzy Baroud is a journalist author

strike groups had been deployed in the Arabian Sea to ensure freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce while providing the commander with significant striking power when required This is a major increase in US firepower directed at Iran This military movement in the Indian Ocean echoed the tense debate in the White House on the day the announcement was made The New York Times reported that in response to rocket attacks in Baghdad that killed two US soldiers Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert OBrien strongly urged President Donald Trump to initiate tough military action on Iran Their contention was that the country already ravaged by the coronavirus would then be more amenable to negotiations with the US This escalation was avoided because the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff resisted it They argued that there was no evidence of a direct Iranian role in the Iraq attacks that the US response could lead to a larger conflict and that such a confrontation would further damage Americas ties with Iraq Against this backdrop Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Friday at the commencement of Nowruz the Iranian New Year directly addressed the American people He noted that the coronavirus pandemic made no distinction as to nationality or gender or religious background In this long fight he said we all belong to one front Despite this he noted that the US government had imposed more than 100 collective punishment measures against the Iranian people He urged his audience to speak loudly to correct this dark chapter in American history Later Rouhani referred to the US offer of humanitarian assistance as the biggest lie in history With more than 27000 people confirmed infected by the virus and 2000 dead Iran is among the worstaffected countries globally From the city of Qom the virus has traveled across the country It has infected several prominent personalities including two vice presidents senior adviser to the supreme leader Ali Akbar Velayati several members of the Majlis the head of the national emergency services and the deputy health minister Observers believe that the government was slow in publicizing the virus attack in its early stages and did not take adequate precautionary measures This might have aggravated the spread and the death toll From midFebruary however the country has been tackling the scourge on a war footing with lockdowns of holy shrines restrictions on movement and the nationwide mobilization of emergency medical services Irans neighbors have put restrictions on the crossborder movement of goods and people while the UAE has provided urgently required medical supplies The pandemic has aggravated the damage to the Iranian economy caused by US sanctions Following the imposition of the sanctions Irans oil exports have plunged to below 10 billion per year reducing its annual budget by about 40 percent Its middle class has shrunk from 60 percent of the population in the 2000s to below 50 percent today The sanctions have also reduced Iranians average purchasing power by about 20 percent since 2018 The government has blamed US sanctions for its limited medical supplies Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif has asked the UN secretarygeneral to end the sanctions which are obstacles to the sale of medicines medical supplies and humanitarian goods Iranian commentator Bijan Khajehpour has said that the pandemic could cause a contraction of Irans gross domestic product by about 3 percent Hence Iran for the first time since its revolution of 1979 has asked the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan The pandemic has aggravated the damage to the Iranian economy caused by US sanctions Talmiz Ahmad The most vulnerable are obviously the very poor The presidents former economic adviser Masoud Nili has said that the poor would be unable to protect themselves against the coronavirus they would be the epicenter of contracting and spreading the disease Heeding this advice Rouhani prioritized cash transfers to those without a known source of income which is about 20 percent of the population In the face of challenges from sanctions Iran has displayed both resilience and innovation Its initiatives have included Greater domestic production increased nonoil exports such as petrochemicals cement and steel and the boosting of regional markets including Iraq Turkey and Afghanistan However with the US policy approach to Iran being limited to initiating fresh sanctions in the hope of pressurizing Tehran to return to negotiations the outlook for Iran remains grim Its economy is likely to remain under severe pressure while the regional titfortat skirmishes could at some point escalate into a wider conflict that no one wants What the Middle East desperately needs is a shift from maximum pressure to maximum understanding and accommodation in order to realize a comprehensive regional peace agreement That would be the best outcome of the coronavirus pandemic Talmiz Ahmad is an author and former Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Oman and the UAE He holds the Ram Sathe Chair for International Studies at the

twin health and financial crises The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic The rapid spread of the disease has challenged world leaders and stretched health capacity to the limit in many countries In their attempts to reduce the health risks countries have drastically curtailed economic activity making a global recession almost certain Oil exporters are facing an additional crisis with falling oil prices due to shrinking demand and the failure to reach agreement on production cuts Comparable reductions in government revenues are expected to add to the economic woes However Iranian hardliners are focused on escalation against the US and its allies taking advantage of the worlds preoccupation with the emerging health and economic problems How Iran allowed the coronavirus to spread before taking measures to contain it exposed deep problems in its political system and the dangers of clerical control of governmental decisions Some clerics dismissed fears of contagion claiming that frequenting religious sites and engaging in sacred rituals immunized visitors from the disease This approach together with a fragile health system led to Iran becoming the first center of the disease outside China Tehran cynically encouraged citizens from neighboring countries to visit crowded religious sites in Iran without safeguards It waived the stamping of passports to hide the fact that visitors had been to Iran which made it difficult to screen travelers upon their return It appears now that a majority of the infections detected in Gulf Cooperation Council GCC countries involved people who had visited Iran Adding to the confusion Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei hinted that the US was behind the spread of the disease Last week he instructed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC to establish a medical base to prevent the spread of the disease The next day he tweeted in English Since there is some evidence that this may be a BiologicalAttack the establishment of this base in the armed forces for confronting the Coronavirus may also be regarded as a biological defense exercise IRGC head Maj Gen Mohammed Salami speculated on March 5 that the global coronavirus outbreak might be a US biological warfare attack on China Others said that coronavirus in Iran was an American biological attack aimed at the resistance axis ie Iran and its regional allies Some see the disease in apocalyptic terms On Sunday Ali Reza Benahyan a cleric close to Khamenei said that the coronavirus spread was a certain sign of the approaching return of AlMahdi The worse the conditions get the closer we are to his reappearance he told Tasnim News Agency While most people ridicule such pronouncements many average citizens probably believed them The denial of a scientific basis for the contagion accounts for the reluctance of some of those affected to declare themselves as such or to seek help explaining in part the diseases rapid spread in Iran and the difficulties GCC countries initially faced in detecting it in travelers from Iran Cynically the IRGC saw in the epidemic an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of its designs in the region This has been evident in Iraq and Yemen over the past few weeks In late February Kataib Hezbollah the Iranianallied militia in Iraq chose Abu Fadak aka AbdulAziz AlMohammadawi to succeed Abu Mahdi AlMuhandis who was killed in the US drone attack that targeted Qassem Soleimani in January His choice indicated a harder line toward the US and its allies Abu Fadak was previously in charge of intelligence at Kataib Hezbollah managing its close affiliation with the IRGC He was also responsible for coordinating the relationships between the Iranallied militias in Iraq and Hezbollah of Lebanon and the Syrian regime He is believed to have visited Yemen to assist the Houthis in their fight against the Yemeni government Abu Fadak is also believed to have close contacts with Iranallied groups in Bahrain organizing their trips to Iraq Syria and Lebanon Abu Fadak wasted no time in carrying out Irans plans to drive American troops out of Iraq His group is believed to be behind a number of recent attacks against US interests in Iraq On March 11 a rocket attack on the Camp Taji base north of Baghdad which is used by the global antiDaesh coalition killed two Americans and one member of Britains armed forces while injuring 14 others Then on Saturday more than two dozen rockets were fired at the same base wounding three Americans and two Iraqis Tehran cynically encouraged citizens from neighboring countries to visit crowded religious sites in Iran without safeguards Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg In Yemen the Iranallied Houthis have reopened several fronts in a bid to drive government forces out They attacked several targets in the Nehm Mountains near Sanaa and in the AlJawf and Dhale provinces In the process the Houthis made the humanitarian crisis in the country worse While the UN and coalition countries led by Saudi Arabia are trying to improve the humanitarian situation the Houthis are exasperating the UNs patience They have hoarded aid intended for the needy sold it on the black market at exorbitant prices and frequently denied the UN access to food stores established by the organization itself The new attacks have displaced tens of thousands of Yemenis who have fled to governmentcontrolled areas The Houthis appear to follow the same pattern as Iran in terms of disregard for human lives in their pursuit for political and military gain It appears then that Irans hardline officials have not seen the need during these difficult times to deescalate and reach out to their neighbors and the international community Instead they have found it to be an opportunity to pursue their quixotic ambitions to dominate the region while Iran itself is in the grips of a devastating disease and facing a deepening economic crisis that could lead to its

protective equipment as well as the complete collapse of the economy If anyone hoped for a silver lining to the appalling effects of the blockade of Gaza it was that it would at least be isolated and protected from the pandemic But unfortunately its people who have endured so much for so long have not been spared and nine cases of infection had been identified by the end of March We must also remember that the level of testing is low and the nightmare scenario of an outbreak in a densely populated space with unhygienic conditions and no adequate health service may now become a reality along with the dire consequences that would follow If COVID19 spreads across Gaza responsibility will stick with those who had the power to prevent or at least mitigate it and neglected to do so Yossi Mekelberg Israel has long washed its hands of any responsibility for the situation in Gaza and blamed Hamas for every misfortune that has befallen its people But whatever the shortcomings of Hamas and there are many and whatever the extent of the groups responsibility for conditions in Gaza Israel along with the part played by Egypt maintains and guards this small enclave as the worlds largest openair prison Israel might have withdrawn from Gaza in 2005 but it is still everpresent there It is an occupying force and has legal obligations for the wellbeing of the Gazan people in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention and Israels High Court the court has ruled that given Israels control of border crossings which means that Gazans are dependent on it for all movement of people and goods in and out of the Strip Israel has a legal obligation to provide for their essential humanitarian needs If that is true in normal times then the loomingcoronavirus catastrophe reinforces it Beth Oppenheim director of international relations for the Israeli humanitarian organisation Gisha told me of her worries at the prospect of the spread of coronavirus in Gaza The Strips critical infrastructure and services have been decimated by decades of Israeli occupation 13 years of suffocating closure and recurrent conflicts Gazas ailing health sector is ill prepared to manage a crisis of this magnitude It is no surprise then to learn that her organization whose goal is to protect the freedom of movement of Palestinians especially Gaza residents and ensure that they enjoy rights enshrined by international and Israeli law has written to Israels Defense Minister Nafatali Bennet and to the coordinator of government activities in the territories appealing or more accurately demanding that Israel take immediate action to ensure the maintenance of a functioning economy and food security in the Gaza Strip One can only share Gishas concerns and declare most emphatically that without the immediate removal of restrictions on supplies of socalled dualuse materials needed for farming and fishing and permitting commodities to leave Gaza to be traded in the West Bank this tiny enclave faces even further catastrophic consequences But even if Israel were to enact those measures promptly and decisively it would be some while before they had any effect A population more than half of whom live below the poverty line and suffer from food insecurity and a third of whom live in abject poverty is much more susceptible to the consequences of any pandemic let alone COVID19 Putting aside for a moment the legal and moral obligations Israel has toward Gaza it would also serve Israels interests and make good sense to ease the enclaves health and economic pressures If COVID19 spreads across Gaza responsibility will stick with those who had the power to prevent or at least mitigate it and neglected to do so The Israeli government can no longer adhere to the old assumption that the worse it gets in Gaza the closer will come the downfall of Hamas This has already failed to materialize now responsibility for heaven forfend mass infections and an enormous death toll in Gaza would be and seen to be to a large extent Israels On the other hand were Israel to take a more considered approach in collaboration with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas while involving the international community it could just could be a move in the right direction and change the discourse between Israel and Gaza Such a move may not achieve immediate reconciliation but could at least lead to a more conciliatory attitude that saw the people in Gaza as human beings and future peaceful neighbors not mere pawns in the war with Hamas Yossi Mekelberg is professor of international relations at Regents University London where he is head of the International Relations and Social Sciences Program He is also an associate fellow of the MENA Program at Chatham House He

lifethreatening challenges with the coronavirus that many doctors face in wartorn countries like Syria Yemen and the Sudan says Syrian American doctor Zaher Sahloul Sahloul who headed the Syrian American Medical Society SAMS effort to save civilian lives during the Syrian civil war from 2011 until 2017 has brought his experience to America in the hopes of defeating the deadly coronavirus pandemic which he says is as threatening to lives as is war A criticalcare physician Sahloul says he sees the same parallels challenging the medical industry in the fight against coronavirus as he did in beleaguered regions of the world like Syria I dont know what to call it maybe a strange twist of fate when I left Syria to come here and now must fight this very deadly virus COVID19 he said When you have a disaster that overwhelms the healthcare system to respond to the disaster the same principles that applied in the Syria war apply here The medical profession in Syria was overwhelmed by the thousands of civilians who were injured and died during the civil war and political violence through standard military weaponry like fighter jets firing missiles spraying civilian areas with bullets or dropping chemical weapons according to Sahloul The coronavirus he says is different only in that it does not have a political agenda and does not target people based on their race ethnicity or religion In Syria for the past nine years where everyone knows we have had crisis after crisis and sometimes it is a population under siege he said We saw bombings of hospitals and the killing of doctors and chemical weapons being used Healthcare providers were struggling to manage with very limited resources Sahloul says he sees the same limited resources being used as doctors and medical centers around the country struggle to provide care for everyone infected by the virus You cannot as a doctor or nurse in Syria save every patient that comes to you after a barrel bomb because of the limited resources Sahloul said I was in Syria in hospitals that were built underground for protection in Aleppo and Idlib You would see an influx of patients who came into the emergency room after a barrel bomb and you had to make difficult decisions he said You know you have limited resources and you dont have the best technologies Sometimes you dont even have enough surgeons who are qualified to do the surgeries So you have to decide which patients you have to direct your resources to Sahloul says there are differences between treating casualties in war zones like Syria Yemen or even in the Gaza Strip but that in a region where it is a virus and not a war medical professionals are seeing a similar crisis standard of care Doctors and nurses are human When you are dealing with crisis people have depression anxiety and PTSD and that is why it is very important to take care of the health of doctors nurses and medical staff during this pandemic Sahloul said We have many patients who have COVID19 who end up in the intensive care unit Some of them will live and some of them wont We dont have enough ventilators for them all Many of the patients needing treatment for COVID19 are doctors and nurses he said The protection of healthcare survivors is another parallel In Syria we had suffered many doctors suffered from the lack of protection from bombs Here we suffering because of a lack of protection because we have a shortage of PPEs Sahloul said At the peak of the chemical weapons used in Syria I remember in one of the medical missions I took with me a bag full of gas masks for physicians so they could protect themselves Some of them died just because of exposure to sarin gas and chlorine gas Here we have physicians dying because of exposure to virus because we dont have PPEs This is also another parallel that we have to the disaster in Syria and other places in Yemen Gaza and now in many countries around the world including right here in the United States Sahloul was born to Syrian parents who believed in public service in Algeria and were provided education instruction there He was raised in Homs and graduated from medical school in Damascus in 1988 He later immigrated to the US where he studied pulmonary medical care at the University of Illinois at Chicago That same drive to help people also drives the life of his wife Suzanne Akhras Sahloul who heads the Syrian Community Network that helps Syrian refugees They have three children After leaving SAMS in 2017 Sahloul established a private practice in Chicagos suburbs Pulmonary Consultants based in the Chicago suburb of Chicago Ridge was launched in 2017 Sahloul has 20 partners who cover six of the largest hospitals in the Chicago area in Americas Midwest Sahloul also launched MedGlobal which brings together a thousand medical professionals from 25 different countries to provide medical support in wartorn regions of the world The purpose of MedGlobal is to reduce healthcare disparity by providing health care to areas going through disaster Sahloul said MedGlobal hosts programs in Gaza Yemen Syria Columbia Venezuela Bangladesh Pakistan and more MedGlobal strives to build resilience within the local communities through the training of healthcare providers the donation of technology medical supplies and medications and through other aspects of supporting healthcare providers in those countries Sahloul spent many years in Syria working with SAMS and tears up when he speaks about the people who perished including many doctors he knew as a result of the conflict About 920 medical professionals were killed during Syrias war and hospitals continue to be targeted he said We started a fund to support a safety net hospital in Chicago that was providing care to African American and Latino communities that has a shortage of supplies ventilators and PPEs at St Anthonys Hospital Healthcare disparity is everywhere Syria is the worst humanitarian crisis of our lifetime but COVID19 is as brutal of a killer and threat to the entire world Sahloul said We have to stop it We will

fascination for international news junkies amid the saturation media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Unlike in the past however when the countrys missile and nuclear weapons program was invariably the center of attention this time it is the health of its leader Chairman Kim Jong Un Kims unexplained absence for nearly 21 days from April 11 fueled speculation that he had been incapacitated either by COVID19 or as a result of a botched surgery In the first week of this month speculation about his wellbeing was revived by video footage of the leader speaking during a ribboncutting ceremony in a newly opened fertilizer factory located north of Pyongyang Now Kim seems to have repeated his disappearing act he has not been publicly seen for the past two weeks Compounding fears about the future of the DPRK has been the emergence of COVID19 cases in towns along the border with China Beijing has sealed off cities in the northeastern Jilin province as a new cluster of cases threatens to undermine its containment of the pandemic In all likelihood Kim is keeping his distance from Pyongyang due to a suspected COVID19 outbreak across the country Experts have expressed skepticism about North Koreas claim of zero infections attributing it to the countrys reluctance to admit disease outbreaks its weak medical infrastructure and extreme sensitivity to any potential threat to Kims rule Also undermining the claim is the donation of 1500 COVID19 test kits to North Korea from Russia in February Observers say similar kits had been shipped there from China A few relief agencies notably UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders are said to have dispatched gloves masks goggles and hand hygiene products to North Korea Experts have also noted that Kims health problems obesity heavy smoking and drinking and a family history of kidney and heart disease put him at higher risk for severe illness if he were to contract the virus US President Donald Trump has publicly wished Kim good health highlighting the importance that Washington still places in reaching what could very well be a legacymaking peace deal with Pyongyang Talks have stalled since the two leaders met a year ago in the worlds most fortified demilitarized zone between the two Koreas where President Trump made history by becoming the first sitting American president to enter North Korea There was much hope then that a peace deal centered around the countrys nuclear program could gain momentum Though there are no signs yet that the DPRK is ready to enter into longterm talks there has been a notable decrease in tensions and threats that could destabilize the Korean Peninsula Despite his intermittent disappearances Kims proof of life has been essentially established The heightened speculation during April as to whether Kim was alive or dead underscored the fragility of the worlds knowledge on what would happen to the DPRK without him at the helm And the truth is no one really knows Quoting Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield the US journal Foreign Affairs states that Kim is considered physically weak for his age by South Korean doctors who have analyzed footage of him at summits Although he is only 36 Kims premature death is a real possibility which means that North Korea could undergo a leadership transition at any moment Katrin Fraser Katz and Victor Cha write in the Foreign Affairs essay No one knows who would take charge of North Korea if that happened or how long a new hierarchy would likely take to consolidate its power A rapid collapse or internal fighting between competing factions that could result from Kims untimely demise without a clear succession plan in place would no doubt cause a security dilemma for the whole world Recently 38 North a respected source of detailed analysis on the DPRK highlighted the danger of a rapid collapse in the country Among all the challenges associated with a North Korean collapse the use of weapons of mass destruction WMD or movement of WMD out of the country will have the largest strategic implications it said The extensive size and complexity of North Koreas nuclear chemical and biological NBC weapons programs make it virtually impossible for the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea to have 100 percent clarity of intelligence and greatly increases the likelihood that regime forces individual opportunists fleeing members of the regime leadership or breakaway separatists could gain access to WMD A flareup between the two Koreas would likely lay South Koreas capital Seoul to waste wreak havoc with the lives of its ten million inhabitants and lead to a major humanitarian catastrophe Against this tense backdrop Trump should be commended for continuing to take bold steps towards preventing a devastating war from breaking out on the Korean Peninsula Diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang could eventually neutralize the very real threat of nucleartipped intercontinental ballistic missiles reaching major American cities on the west coast Trumps Kissingerstyle direct approach to Kim has laid the foundation for what could prove to be a turning point in the annals of Washingtons Korea policy And with the pandemic ravaging large expanses of the world diplomatic engagement between the two countries is needed now more than ever Normalizing bilateral relations establishing new lines for trade in addition to humanitarian assistance and ushering in a new era of prosperity for the people of the DPRK who badly need it is a vision that offers longterm security assurances for both the American and Korean people What is more bringing North Korea into the fold of responsible nation states may be the best insurance against the transfer of knowledge and technologies related to ballistic missiles and nuclear weapon components to rogue Middle East actors such as Iran and Syria with whom the regime has had historical partnerships The White House should therefore continue to seek a comprehensive peace deal with the DPRK as a diplomatic priority particularly during the coronavirus pandemic Now more than ever Kims hollowedout economy needs access to global investment and finance A deal with Washington and Seoul can make that a reality It would be a worthwhile initiative not just from the standpoint of Trumps presidential legacy but also for its potential for eliminating a longstanding source of geopolitical instability

reserves exhausted With the first case of COVID19 being recorded on February 21 in Lebanon Chinese authorities rushed to deliver medical assistance to the government The promptness created the impression in some circles that China was seeking a foothold in Lebanon which had long been viewed as a political playground for major powers and the Middle East is gateway of sorts to the West A call sounded by the Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in November last year and repeated a few weeks ago to go to China to save Lebanon financially and economically has left many wondering whether Lebanese

Lebanon is largest music center currently being built by Chinese companies The Lebanese state has only provided the land Daher believes the Chinese are taking the long view with the Lebanese economy and the military as well as the banks still tied to American institutions He dismisses the notion that China is seeking to gain control over Lebanon is political and economic decisionmaking structures China is not being able to get into Lebanon Entry even through investment projects will be difficult since the Lebanese ask for their cuts but the Chinese like the Japanese do not pay bribes from

forbidden from entering Lebanon in such ways Daher puts it this way China is interested in marketing its products in such a way that both parties can benefit from Lebanon is an economically distressed country and does not constitute an important market for China The problem is that the money of the Lebanese people is blocked in banks and the economy is in recession China sells us its products at

pages of the worlds press last week was a warning that should be ringing alarm bells in the corridors of power in wealthy states Put starkly unless action is taken now the World Food Programme WFP reports that by the end of the year some 265 million people in poorer countries will be in acute food insecurity This is put into sharper perspective when one realizes it is almost a doubling of the 2019 figure of 135 million Why this massive surge The WFP forecast attributes this primarily to the economic consequences of the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic Those countries that in 2019 suffered the most acute rates of hunger now face massive economic disruption and a devastating strain on their already overstretched health services Authorities will have to balance the need for economic survival with the desire to save lives What would be the point of preventing deaths by the virus if that expense and effort leads even more people to die of hunger That is a tradeoff worthy of ones worst nightmares The pandemic is seeing a massive rise in unemployment including in lowerincome countries where safety nets are nonexistent Lockdown restrictions and curfews have a bevy of knockon effects Disruption to food supply chains during the pandemic and restrictions on transport mean farmers will be hit The inability to travel has led to a lack of agricultural labor even in Europe where seasonal fruit pickers for the UK for example are already being flown in from Romania under special conditions Getting agricultural seeds or getting to livestock markets will be more challenging or even impossible For nomadic and seminomadic communities the closure of borders will jeopardize their way of life None of this is helped by a second invasion of locusts in East Africa in the space of a few months This one is estimated to be 20 times larger than the last The driver was not drought but plentiful rains creating ideal breeding grounds for the voracious pests The coronavirus pandemic exacerbates existing situations of hunger The primary drivers of hunger are conflicts climate change and economic crisis About half of the cases of acute food insecurity resulted from conflicts another half of which are in the Middle East and Asia Acute cases include Yemen Syria and Sudan In Yemen alone more than 17 million people are in need of humanitarian food assistance According to figures from 2019 61 percent of South Sudans population faces acute hunger The impact of conflict does not end when the fighting stops as landmines and unexploded ordnance render large tracts of land unusable Feeding an evergrowing global refugee and displaced population of about 70 million is another challenge COVID19 could even drive further conflict as groups vie for declining resources Peacekeeping operations will be under further strain Weatherrelated events such as droughts are for the nextbiggest driver of hunger And droughts and flooding are becoming more severe as a consequence of climate change Economic crises are on the rise Food prices are increasing not least in countries where the currency is depreciating drastically against the dollar such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo Syria or Yemen Remittances to poorer societies are also declining while low oil prices are hitting economies such as Nigerias where the continuing conflict with Boko Haram has already led to the internal displacement of 25 million people Humanitarian aid has to rise to cope with this threat However the costs of delivering this aid have increased as sourcing supplies is becoming harder Major donor countries will likely divert resources from overseas development and humanitarian projects to fighting the pandemic Zero hunger is the second of the UNs Sustainable Development Goals This worthy target which has a target of 2030 aims to end hunger achieve food security improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture It is the priority of the WFP but will it achieve this Major donor countries will likely divert resources from overseas development and humanitarian projects to fighting the pandemic Chris Doyle The amazing and positive thing is that we can actually feed the planet The UNs Food and Agriculture Organization stated in 2015 that there are 216 million fewer hungry people in the world than in 199092 despite a 19 billion increase in the worlds population Sadly some of this extra capacity has come from destroying huge tracts of vital rainforest Consider that about a third of the food humans produce is lost or wasted a loss to the global economy of a paltry 1 trillion every year Famine is no longer some oneoff disaster that devastates communities but is typically a result of human failure or conflict Syria Yemen and South Sudan are all manmade famines As ever it is a question of political will a commodity also at famine levels UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres was spoton when he said We have the tools and the knowhow What we need is political will and sustained commitment by leaders and nations The question is while distracted domestically will the richer nations have the will and wherewithal to prevent a disaster among the poorest After all it would not be a great look as Americans and Europeans battle over toilet rolls in supermarket aisles to see millions of children dying of famine Chris Doyle is director of the

reporting they are coronavirusfree states are racing to stem a rising tide of infections A pandemic of this scale has been deemed a onceinalifetime event In recent years prescient warnings by policy experts medical professionals and intelligence analysts took a backseat to what were perceived as more urgent national security issues including counterterrorism cyber defense border control and combat readiness It is an unfortunate reality that the global health security agenda is often relegated to international fora in which states make lofty and at times unachievable pledges to strengthen preparedness planning It comes as little surprise then that many states pandemic responses are underfunded underdeveloped or understaffed Yet as the host of some of the world is largest religious pilgrimages Saudi Arabia has historically invested heavily in global health security For the Kingdom preparedness planning has been a strategic necessity of grave national concern the 2019 Umrah season alone attracted over 61 million visitors to Makkah with 25 million more gathering for the Hajj that year With an early warning surveillance system put in place with the help of the World Health Organization WHO Saudi Arabia has long recognized that emerging health issues can quickly go global Saudi Arabia is proactive management of health threats including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS outbreak of 2012 led thenUS Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Joseph Westphal to state The Kingdom is not only committed to expanding its own healthcare capabilities but also to assuming a leadership role in encouraging other nations to do so From the start Saudi Arabia is response to COVID19 has been international in nature The Kingdom has stood out in the region both for the domestic measures it has taken to curb the virus spread and its efforts to strengthen ties with states disproportionately affected by the pandemic In a recent conversation with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman affirmed the Kingdom is commitment to leading international efforts in the fight against COVID19 During a call between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Crown Prince both sides affirmed the need for coordinated action in developing a vaccine and reducing economic strain Days later King Salman chaired an emergency virtual G20 meeting with world leaders to strengthen the global response to COVID19 It is our responsibility to extend a helping hand to developing countries and the leastdeveloped countries to enable them to build their capacities and improve their infrastructure to overcome this crisis and its repercussions King Salman stated at the extraordinary G20 Leaders Summit The Saudi leadership has kept its promise turning outwards to assist those in need On March 31 the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center donated 10 million to the World Health Organization to fund urgent response activities and stimulate vaccine research In neighboring Yemen Saudi Arabia is donation of 35 million worth of medical assistance included medication and testing kits to help the country avert a devastating outbreak that would further overburden a healthcare system strained by years of war And in China Saudi Arabia contributed more than 2000 medical devices 300000 masks and 1000 other pieces of personal protective equipment to help medical staff in Wuhan in the early days of the outbreak Few nations can afford to act unilaterally in combating COVID19 After closing borders and banning the entry of foreign nationals some states may be drawn to a sort of isolationism that might endure beyond this crisis Yet despite these restrictions states are working together to alleviate suffering in the immediate term and lay the groundwork for broader multilateral cooperation on global health issues In the long term international engagement on the global health agenda is critical Countries like Saudi Arabia have much to teach the world on ways to control one of the greatest health threats of our lifetime While the COVID19 crisis has exposed weaknesses in global health commitments efforts to fight the pandemic have underscored a simple truth robust and durable international partnerships are essential in driving policies that save lives Through these global health coalitions states can share expertise allocate resources to places in need and apply consistent measures across continents to extinguish flareups When the COVID19 crisis ends many countries will have developed institutional knowledge at a national level on pandemic response States will eventually be able to come together again whether at the next UN General Assembly Munich Security Conference or the World Government Summit and each country will have a story to tell one of adversity loss and triumph These experiences will determine how the global community responds to the next allencompassing threat For those willing to transform lessons learned on global health preparedness into concrete action there is strength in numbers Madison Clough is a strategic communications professional residing in the Gulf She holds a master is degree in

as long as he desires AFPFile Short Url European publics are submitting themselves to emergency measures that resemble the worst excesses of a police state Citizens punished for leaving their homes or holding small gatherings parliaments suspended trials without jury emergency security laws electronic surveillance of individuals the list goes on The coronavirus pandemic poses existential questions for the alreadyprecarious vision of a united democratic and liberal Europe Many governments introduced legislation reluctantly under specific recommendations from medical experts However there has also been an insidious trend of autocrats exploiting the pandemic to massively expand their personal powers Hungary is Viktor Orban introduced an omnipotence law allowing him to govern without parliamentary approval for as long as he desires and a bill to sideline local councils in decisionmaking processes One European foreign minister noted that Orban is dictatorial regime belongs in strict political quarantine However an EU statement responding to these measures was only signed off by half of the member states and failed even to mention Hungary by name Poland is government has revised its electoral law to expedite the rollout of the May presidential elections assuming that the only candidate able to organize a campaign would be current president Andrzej Duda Poland meanwhile is not the only state where measures are in circulation banning doctors from airing criticism of the health care system With well over half the world is coronavirus deaths recorded in Europe a further divide has opened up between nations like Germany which have successfully minimized fatalities and Spain and Italy each of which are currently seeing about 700 deaths every day The global challenges we face are far bigger than can be addressed by any country acting alone Baria Alamuddin After a decade of deep austerity measures the health systems of Italy Spain the UK and Portugal have been tested to breaking point by the epidemic There are dire shortages of medical staff with more than 60 health care professionals dead in Italy alone As Spanish morgues and funeral homes overflow corpses are being stored at a Madrid ice rink Southern European nations were already suffering from high debt levels and sluggish economies Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called on the EU to embark on the greatest mobilization of economic and material resources in history perhaps through issuing Europewide recovery bonds However the Germans Austrians and Dutch are wary of bearing the financial brunt with memories still raw of the expensive post2008 bailouts of states like Greece and Italy Videoconferences among EU ministers have at times deteriorated into bitter slanging matches The Dutch finance minister queried why some states lacked the financial wherewithal to fight the crisis The Portuguese prime minister denounced these comments as repugnant Francois Heisbourg from the International Institute for Strategic Studies warned of the enormous resentment caused by such statements You are an Italian and you are considered as a plaguebearer by the Germans This is where the real danger for Europe lies In a major boost to Italy is farright citizens have reportedly burned EU flags to vent their fury at Europe is failure to support the worsthit nations European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week apologized to Italy noting that individual nations had been consumed by their own problems They did not realize that we can only defeat this pandemic together as a union This was harmful and could have been avoided Despite local outpourings of publicspiritedness humanitarian sentiments are less visible across national borders Germany and France initially imposed export bans on essential medical equipment while Italy pleaded for assistance TV images of Russia and China airlifting crates of aid to Italy provided grist to the mill of euroskeptics and proMoscow propagandists Meanwhile the US has been accused of piracy in its aggressive efforts to monopolize medical supplies worldwide Germany protested after America diverted 200000 face masks that had been en route to Berlin from China France complained that the US had triggered bidding wars in certain strategic marketplaces including swooping in at the last minute and paying several times the asking price for goods already promised to other states The virus has furthermore dealt a vicious blow to the core European principle of free movement Indeed Europe is hesitant and piecemeal approach to closing borders was a major factor in the virus is global dissemination In 93 countries the first recorded cases came from Europe 46 from Italy with China only directly responsible for 27 recorded first arrivals States such as Italy have been unsurprisingly reluctant to allow refugees and migrants to enter However this should not mean allowing hundreds to die at sea If nations simply close their doors refugee camps on Europe is frontiers risk becoming incubators for infinitely worse future bouts of infection The post2016 worldwide explosion of Trumpian populism was distinguished by a backlash against experts and multilateral organizations Defunding UN institutions and disasterplanning centers left us undefended against a pandemic that rides roughshod across national borders Transnational entities like the UN EU and the World Health Organization are inevitably bestplaced to mobilize coordinated global responses ensuring the adequate distribution of essential goods quarantine efforts and monitoring the virus is spread Carnegie Europe Director Rosa Balfour emphasized that challenges like pandemics can only be addressed multilaterally saying If the balance tips in favor of national positions that could kill the EU The EU furthermore requires sufficient strength of purpose to rein in national leaders who counterproductively exploit crises for their own interests In a recent speech French President Emmanuel Macron called for a Europewide awakening with the EU acting with greater autonomy on international security Macron is vision of a strong and autonomous Europe flies in the face of recent continentwide tendencies but it constitutes an essential reminder that the global challenges we face are far bigger than can be addressed by any country even Donald Trump is America acting alone In the overcrowded viral petri dish of planet Earth the 2020 coronavirus may be a trial run for infinitely more deadly future pandemics and environmental threats The

Iran news outlets reported Thursday as health officials in warravaged Yemen and Gaza expressed mounting concern about waves of new cases Irans semiofficial news agencies cited Deputy Health Minister Qassem Janbabaei who did not elaborate Reports earlier in the week put the number of infected health care workers at only 800 Iran says more than 100 of those workers have died Iran is grappling with the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East with at least 7249 fatalities among more than 129000 confirmed cases Those figures include an additional 66 deaths announced Thursday by Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour For most people the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks For some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia and death The international aid group Doctors Without Borders said the virusrelated death toll at a medical center it runs in southern Yemen attests to a wider catastrophe in the country where a fiveyear civil war had already caused the worlds worst humanitarian crisis The facility in Aden admitted 173 patients between April 30 and May 17 at least 68 of whom have died the group known by its French acronym MSF said in a statement The UNrecognized government in the south has confirmed 193 cases nationwide with 33 fatalities What we are seeing in our treatment center is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in the city said Caroline Seguin MSFs operations manager for Yemen People are coming to us too late to save and we know that many more people are not coming at all they are just dying at home The government tally of cases does not include confirmed cases in the countrys north which is under the control of Houthi rebels The rebels are believed to be concealing the magnitude of the outbreak by suppressing numbers and intimidating journalists and doctors So far they have reported four cases including one death of a Somali migrant On Tuesday a 35yearold World Food Program staffer died of COVID19 the illness caused by the virus in the Houthicontrolled province of Saada the group said The Iranbacked Houthis captured much of northern Yemen including the capital Sanaa in 2014 forcing the government to flee to the south The following year a Saudiled coalition went to war against the rebels The increase in suspected coronavirus cases in Yemen is sounding alarms throughout the global health community which fears the virus will spread like wildfire through some of the worlds most vulnerable populations The World Health Organization says its models suggest that under some scenarios half of Yemens population of 30 million could be infected with the virus and more than 40000 could die Half of Yemens health facilities are dysfunctional and 18 of the countrys 333 districts have no doctors Water and sanitation systems have collapsed Many families can barely afford one meal a day The high level of mortality we are seeing among our patients is equivalent to those of intensive care units in Europe but the people we see dying are much younger than in France or Italy mostly men between 40 and 60 years old Seguin said The war in Yemen has killed more than 100000 people and left millions suffering from food and medical shortages Another area of concern is the Gaza Strip where the Health Ministry has reported 35 new cases in the last three days bringing the total number to 55 All the new cases have been detected among returnees from abroad who are in mandatory quarantine in facilities at the border Yousef Abu elRish a senior Health Ministry official said Thursday it is investigating whether the virus has spread beyond the quarantine facilities where some 2000 people are housed Gazas health care system has been severely degraded by a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group Hamas seized power there in 2007 The territory only has around 60 ventilators for a population of 2 million In Egypt a government official acknowledged for the first time that the states outbreak is likely much larger than reported Khaled Abdel Ghaffar the minister of higher education said at a conference Thursday attended by the president and other top officials that disease models suggest the states current count of 15003 infections is an estimated five times lower than the projected numbers of 71145 or more This is a hypothetical model that we say can be a reality he said noting that across the world officials cannot know precisely how many people are infected In a separate development the International Monetary Fund approved nearly 400 million in emergency financial assistance to Jordan which has largely succeeded in containing its outbreak by imposing wideranging quarantine measures Jordan a close Western ally has reported 672 cases including nine fatalities

relevant as it is today with a pandemic and economic recession wreaking havoc globally The need for international coordination has never been greater and the G20 is the right format for such cooperation as the group comprises the planets 20 largest economies which collectively account for about 90 percent of the worlds gross domestic product 80 percent of trade twothirds of its population and half of its land area They have the coverage the financial means and the necessary tools to mitigate the impact of these twin crises Last week China called for multilateral efforts to coordinate the global response including through the G20 One official said The G20 is the main platform for international macroeconomic policy coordination After the financial crisis in 2008 the G20 played a historic role in coordinating and promoting the world economic recovery He said that China would proactively take part in international coordination and was ready to give constructive ideas on how countries should work together to manage the economic costs of the pandemic But the G20 can play a greater role beyond macroeconomic coordination Saudi Arabia assumed the G20 presidency last December and will continue to hold it until November making it the focal point of international economic coordination King Salman said that Saudi Arabia would seek during its presidency to create a cooperative environment for the G20 to introduce policies and initiatives that will fulfill the hopes of the people of the world The Kingdom this month called for a leaders summit by video conference to discuss the coronavirus crisis During the 200809 global financial crisis the G20s role as well as its stature grew considerably From 1999 when the group was set up until 2008 the G20 was the purview of finance ministers and its discussions focused on the promotion of international financial stability The G7 and sometimes G8 summits were the places where heads of state met and coordinated policies on wider economic and political issues In November 2008 US President George W Bush changed that when he convened the first G20 summit of heads of state in Washington to coordinate responses to the financial crisis The coordinated adoption of financial stimulus packages was one outcome of those deliberations Since then the G20 has held about a dozen summits and scores of ministerial meetings in addition to expert gatherings and other activities It has frequently dealt with issues outside economic policy For example the 2019 G20 summit held in Osaka Japan discussed eight themes The global economy trade and investment innovation environment and energy employment womens empowerment development and health This year a main area of focus should be mitigating the disruptive impact of the coronavirus on global supply chains including its effects on health security and aid to vulnerable communities The disease has led to limited access for employees due to quarantines and curfews factory closures or manufacturing slowdowns limited access to logistics to move goods and skyrocketing costs that are making it difficult for limitedincome families to cope especially when combined with layoffs or forced leaves A main area of focus should be mitigating the disruptive impact of the coronavirus on global supply chains Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg Resilinc a supply chain mapping and riskmonitoring company has issued preliminary reports on the number of items sourced from and the sites of industries located in the quarantined areas severely affected by the pandemic in various countries The information shows that manufacturers in more than a dozen industries are facing a supply crisis and are struggling to mitigate the impact on their supply chains Just like the Fukushima nuclear crisis of 2011 the current crisis has exposed weaknesses in supply chains such as relying on a single source or a limited number of sources for key inputs Especially critical are health supply chains Medical equipment and supplies needed to fight the disease are in short supply and the production lines to make them need to be expanded quickly Distribution is an even greater problem amid rising costs and limited transportation channels Countries with fragile health systems are finding it more difficult to monitor and fight the disease If left to their own devices disease could spread uncontrollably and in the end spread to other countries More alarming for international humanitarian agencies is the fate of refugee communities when the disease reaches them According to the Norwegian Refugee Council more than 70 million people globally have been forced to flee their homes by persecution conflict violence and human rights violations Of those more than 29 million are refugees of whom 84 percent are being hosted by low or middleincome nations that have weak health water and sanitation systems It is critical that these communities are provided with the means to protect themselves against the ravages of the disease The impacts of coronavirus can be felt in the security area too with serious concerns about weak supply chains difficulties in organizing meetings production slowdowns and logistical disruptions More importantly the disease is making it difficult to move forces and materiel to maintain security in some regions It is especially worrying that Iran and its allies are taking advantage of these disruptions to expand their influence in Iraq Yemen Syria and Lebanon The G20 is well placed to deal with all these issues Countries should put aside their differences as they address the coronavirus crisis For example tensions between the US and China the two largest G20 economies should not delay coordination and agreement on concrete actions to deal with the pandemics repercussions China and the US are each others top trading partners and the economic health of each country depends on the others and now the physical health of their populations depends on their cooperation There are real issues and conflicting interests that divide them which may very well outlast the current pandemic but it should be possible to agree on at least two issues Isolate the immediate coronavirusrelated supply disruptions that affect health and security and avert a total economic meltdown which could prove to be irreversible in the near future Abdel Aziz

escalation in fighting and shelling throughout Yemen has derailed his efforts for resuming talks between warring factions It has pushed back our plans for the resumption of the peace process and showed us the fragility of all gains toward peace he said in an exclusive interview with Arab News I have told the parties publicly and privately that peace will not be dictated from a position of military dominance he added urging Yemenis to concentrate efforts on fighting the spread of coronavirus Now even more than ever with the coronavirus disease COVID19 posing an existential threat to Yemen they must urgently silence the guns and work jointly to combat the common enemy The UN envoy said he appreciated the Kingdoms support to his mission in Yemen and its swift engagement with the organizations call for a truce I am grateful to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his concrete actions of supporting my initiative to comprehensively end the war such as the unilateral ceasefire and concrete gestures to help bring the parties to the conflict closer When the UN appointed Griffiths as its new envoy Yemen in January 2018 he was hailed as a veteran negotiator who could use his extensive experience in conflict resolution negotiation mediation and humanitarian affairs to end the war In 2019 like many Yemen observers the UN envoy said that he thought the country was moving toward peace as fighting largely decreased as the Riyadh Agreement had defused tensions in Aden We could see a positive trend particularly in the reduction of the military activities which was creating a conducive environment for peace talks to begin The signing of the Riyadh Agreement was another factor that made me and all of us more hopeful as it was directing the formation of a more inclusive new government delegation Griffiths said Other positive signs were the advances in prisoner exchanges and allowing ships into Hodeidah port These changes were signaling that the parties were able to find commonalities and not only differences the envoy said Despite the escalating violence the UN envoy said warring factions positive responses to the UN call for a truce and the public support for halting fighting boosted his hope for reviving peace There is a real opportunity for peace in Yemen All warring parties responded publicly and positively to the UN secretarygenerals call for a nationwide ceasefire in Yemen Also remarkably there has been an outpouring of public support for a ceasefire including from civil society organizations youth and women groups political parties and tribal networks It has inspired and encouraged us to push harder and aim higher Yemen is enduring the worlds worst humanitarian crisis Most of the countrys population is in desperate need of assistance The situation Griffiths warned is expected to worsen with the emergence of COVID19 and more fighting We are running out of time And all the good work the UN humanitarian agencies and NGOs do on the ground to address the situation will not be enough if there is no end to the war he said The internationally recognized government and many rights groups usually criticize UN envoys for not strongly shaming the Iranianbacked Houthis for their violence I have explicitly condemned all attacks including the attack on Taiz Central Prison that killed several women and children as well as the attacks in Marib and elsewhere he said adding Besides public condemnation I use my leverage with the parties to ease the situation when possible For example following the deplorable and outrageous death sentences against four journalists in Sanaa my office has been insisting in the negotiation with the parties to include them in the list of detainees to be released in the upcoming exchange At the moment Griffiths is seeking to convince Yemeni parties to accept the UN proposal for a nationwide truce initiating measures to alleviate economic and humanitarian strife and a commitment to resume peace talks The parties have engaged with the proposal and sent several substantive revisions that we have reviewed and sent back amended versions accordingly to bridge the outstanding differences where they exist Regular and detailed negotiations are ongoing and it is my hope that this agreement will be concluded soon The envoy believes the proposal would set the stage for a comprehensive peace settlement that would address key issues such as the constitution elections and the grievances of the southerners He said it would eventually prevent further relapses into violence This agreement would provide the foundation for a broader process to build real and sustainable peace in Yemen that protects it from a future violence This requires commitment from Yemenis The public vocal advocacy for peace reassures me that the people of Yemen are ready to take on this task Griffiths said that recent violence in the western city of Hodeidah after the death of the governments liaison officer has impeded the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement Griffiths expressed his frustration with slow progress on prisonerrelated issues under the deal The progress on this issue has been frustratingly slow Yemenis have every right to expect the parties to fulfill that commitment they made over a year ago I am heartened and grateful for the vocal advocacy of so many civil society organizations and womens networks about this issue The signing of the Riyadh Agreement and its implementation under the auspices of the coalition is an

evacuating its personnel from the country It said that the support provided by the UN through its activities and operations is continuing and increasing at a faster rate regardless of the challenges that resulted from the pandemic of the new coronavirus Stories circulated on social media at the end of last week about the intention of the UN to withdraw from Lebanon and that the international organization had told its foreign employees to prepare their passports in preparation for leaving the country However the UN in Lebanon described this information as speculation in a statement issued on Monday For the first time since 2011 two World Food Programme WFP trucks carrying supplies were seized last Tuesday while crossing the northern coastal road toward Syrian territory The young men who intercepted the trucks justified their actions by saying that the Lebanese were hungry and that some people in the Lebanese state were smuggling food items at the expense of the Lebanese people to the Syrian regime The two trucks are still parked at the Port of Tripoli after Lebanese customs teams worked to protect them and return them to the port Malak Jaafar the WFP spokesperson in Lebanon told Arab News There is no decision yet to move the organizations convoy from Lebanon to Syria The convoy includes 39 trucks loaded with foodstuffs to be sent to the organizations warehouses in Homs Syria There are 37 trucks at Beirut port and two trucks at Tripoli port waiting for security clearance so that we can move the convoy toward Syrian territory and there are contacts with Lebanese officials to secure this protection Jaafar said that the WFP buys its materials from international markets and ships them for the benefit of the organization in Beirut From there Lebanese trucks transport these materials into the Syrian territories which means that our operations pump dollars into the Lebanese market and we and all humanitarian organizations consider Lebanon an important passage for our operations Lebanon is not a country in conflict and we do not need to put a UN logo on the trucks but it is on the food bags and Lebanon is a host country and we thank it all the time The spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Danielle Moylan told Arab News The LebanonSyria border crossing has been recently closed in line with COVID19 preventive measures However there are currently exemptions in place for humanitarian personnel and cargo to transit through which remain an important part of the ongoing humanitarian assistance to more than 6 million people on average in Syria each month The support provided by the UN through its activities and operations is continuing and increasing at a faster rate regardless of the challenges that resulted from the pandemic of the new coronavirus Malak Jaafar WFP spokesperson in Lebanon Lebanon is facing a severe economic recession and collapse of its national currency against the dollar as the exchange rate of the dollar recorded an increase in the black market of more than four times its official price The government is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund to obtain assistance through a rescue plan prepared by the government but disputed by political and economic officials in Lebanon There are fears that the solution of pumping 6 million a day by the central bank to the official moneychangers which started on Monday is a temporary one that may drain the treasury reserves It may prevent the ability to subsidize raw materials medical and diesel in light of the governments failure so far to control the smuggling operations of subsidized materials from Lebanon to Syria especially of flour and diesel Our aid to Lebanon is separate from our aid to Syria Jaafar said Lebanon has a targeted budget and lists since 2012 During this week we will distribute aid to more than 50000 families affected by hunger and the corona pandemic and we have other projects we are implementing in Lebanon related to providing food meals for public schoolchildren in coordination with the Ministry of Social Affairs About 4 million people in Syria the majority of whom have been displaced due to the war in addition to the families whose breadwinners are women and families that have no income benefit from WFP aid according to WFP spokesperson in Syria Abeer Etefa Etefa told Arab News The numbers increase or decrease according to need and these people are distributed in all governorates in Syria We use all border crossings to bring in aid to the Syrian territory from Turkey and Jordan at certain times from Lebanon occasionally across the Iraqi border through the port of Tartus and sometimes by air as we did in Deir Ezzor Etefa said that Lebanon is an important logistical corridor We adhere to what is issued by the Security Council In Syria we have five or six large storage facilities to package and distribute food baskets that are sufficient for one person for a month In Lebanon we use local shipping companies drivers a port and workers It is a hugely useful process On the impact of the freezing of the convoys trip to Syria Etefa said 39 trucks have stopped in Lebanon We are talking about hundreds of thousands of tons of food We hope that things stabilize so that we can continue to use Lebanon and that there will be a benefit for everyone We previously shipped wheat from the US to Syria via Lebanon and nobody objected to the matter Lebanon has an important position and we do not want to lose it We have not reached this stage yet and we hope that we will not reach it because we consider Lebanon to be effective and we want Lebanon to benefit from our operations Meanwhile truck drivers staged a sitin at the Port of Beirut on Monday to protest against Syrian drivers working at the port The Syndicate of Public Truck Owners announced the seizure of more than 10 public trucks driven by Syrians along with their cargo The president of the National Federation of Employees and Workers Unions in Lebanon Castro Abdullah said Truck owners are under pressure due to the conditions in the country We have talked to officials repeatedly and not reached any solution to the issue of drivers We demand the application of laws in this vital facility of the national economy and control of violations that occur in the labor law If the issue is not addressed the port gates will be closed next week

disease COVID19 is one of the biggest challenges the world has faced in decades with some comparing its impact to that of the Second World War As the number of confirmed cases exceeds 15 million and the news of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson being treated in intensive care baffles the world this pandemic will nevertheless not be the end of globalization It might act as a catalyst to some previous trends such as the competition and decoupling between the US and China but it has actually put forward the need for more transparency global communication and collaboration between governments not less Indeed opacity and a lack of communication have had catastrophic consequences A quick overview of various government interactions shows that the more data was shared the better actions were taken against the virus When it comes to the Middle East most countries especially those in the Gulf were transparent in their measures and their reporting while Iran took a defiant stance toward the virus as if it was a political enemy or a conspiracy This came at the cost of many lives and greater instability in the region Nevertheless there have been some positive developments in the region including the fact that the UAE helped Iran face the pandemic Another positive is the Arab coalition is unilateral ceasefire in Yemen as well as Saudi Arabia is allocation of 500 million to the UN humanitarian response plan for Yemen which will help protect all Yemenis including the Iranbacked Houthis from COVID19 Unfortunately this has not changed the Iranian government is policies and opacity in the face of the pandemic as its sole focus seems to be on its regional political agenda and using the pandemic to break its isolation which translated into pushing for an easing of US sanctions with the support of the EU and asking the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan This is unfortunate as transparency and collaboration with the Gulf states could have helped them all act faster and save lives In difficult times it is well known that Saudi Arabia and the UAE propose initiatives that come without strings attached and in good faith between neighbors In this case with more transparency from the Iranian regime they could have formulated a regional response and extended the same care shown for their own citizens and residents to the Iranian people This shows that there is an opportunity for the Iranian regime to bring about a change in regional relations It may be wishful thinking to believe Iran will step up when one knows the agenda and history of the Tehran regime However it is not impossible This crisis has proven that Arab countries do not wish ill and do not look for confrontation with Iran quite the opposite in fact As we all face the same invisible enemy today is a good time for Iran to disengage from regional files that do not threaten its national security such as Yemen and Lebanon to focus on its own domestic development The best way for Iran to break its isolation is by backtracking from its hegemonic agenda and nuclear program and pursuing a more transparent and goodwilled foreign policy Unfortunately Iran seems to be stuck in a 1980s paradigm where COVID19 replaces Saddam Hussein As lockdowns have a heavy economic cost globally uncertainty has become a constant negative factor and the catalyst for a downturn This translates into difficult and unanswered questions for every country What comes after the confinement policies end if new cases keep appearing What if it takes longer than expected What if after all these measures numbers spike again in September How do economies reopen while making sure people stay safe It is now clear that continued lockdowns will have a catastrophic impact on countries economies which will take years to rebuild As unemployment skyrockets and businesses are shattered this can quickly lead to social instability if not total chaos or war Therefore the main objective of governmental action should be to deal with this uncertainty This is by far the most dangerous virus It was the virus of uncertainty that had people in developed countries fighting for toilet paper and rushing to stock up as if the world was ending The world will not end humanity will get through this But there is an immediate need for more transparency and concerted efforts between governments and the private sector in order to deal with the potential scenario of the partial failure of containment policies andor the appearance of a second spike of cases later this year The world will need to reopen for business by the end of April and stay open while keeping people as safe as possible Sweden and South Korea might serve as examples as they went the opposite way and did not impose stringent confinement policies In the Middle East the coming months will be crucial and a new page can be turned It could be the start of the building of a new region A regional postpandemic Marshall Plan approach could propel the Middle East into prosperity for all For this to succeed Iran needs to renounce the opacity it cultivates Unfortunately Iran seems to be stuck in a 1980s paradigm where COVID19 replaces Saddam Hussein Khaled Abou Zahr The opportunity is real as we stand between east and west between China and the US The region should be a land of partnerships business opportunities reconciliations and prosperity not one of endless proxy wars Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has shown Saudi Arabia is resolve for defending regional interests and its ability to face major challenges without shifting from the transformation goals set for the Kingdom This is particularly clear with the G20 preparations as well as the focus on OPEC negotiations and taking timely decisions to fight COVID19 More broadly Gulf countries have been very transparent and forthcoming about the coming challenges and have allocated billions of dollars in support of the private sector This
