diplomacy required to tackle the spread of Covid19 Almost as fast as it has spread the new coronavirus pandemic has become entwined with the divisive politics of South Asia The decisions taken during the crisis by the leaders of the region which is home to roughly a quarter of the worlds population and dangerously sandwiched between the infection hotspots of China and Iran will undoubtedly have wider repercussions The outcome depends largely on the ability of Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to set aside their differences long enough to avert a public health disaster It would also entail a suspension of their domestic political hostilities which in the cases of all three leaders were at their zenith when the Covid19 virus arrived in the region Most of all it would require all three men to rise above their selfish ambitions and for the time being prioritise the wellbeing of the human race Sadly their actions so far suggest that they are unwilling and perhaps even incapable of answering this call for genuine leadership Modis reaction to the crisis has been opportunistic In response to the spread of the new coronavirus he called a videoconference with the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation SAARC to discuss a coordinated response the right thing to do in the circumstances However it quickly became apparent that Modi had a purely political agenda He hoped that the event would help to repair Indias image both globally and in friendly Afghanistan and Bangladesh following his governments enactment of an Islamophobic citizenship law and the murderous Hindutva mob attacks on Muslims that it fomented Modi also calculated that the event would put Pakistan in an embarrassing spot Islamabad and New Delhi have not been on speaking terms literally since he ordered the annexation of Indianadministered Kashmir in August further escalating tensions sparked by Indias aerial incursion into Pakistan in February last year By hosting the videoconference Modi sought to cast himself and thus India as the leader of the eightnation SAARC He knew that Pakistan would have looked petty if it refused to participate and foresaw that Prime Minister Khan would depute a junior proxy rather than appear in person because of the tensions over Kashmir As Indian commentators lauded him for availing the opportunity to show Indias leadership Modi sought to capitalise on his public relations win by proposing a similar video conference of G20 leaders in a telephone conversation with Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Modis grandstanding cannot benefit the people of SAARC much because he has rendered the organisation practically useless since assuming office in 2014 by refusing to engage with Pakistan under its auspices despite maintaining contacts through other multilateral fora like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Instead Modi has sought to emphasise the role of an alternative eastwardlooking grouping the Bay of Bengal Initiative for MultiSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation which excludes Pakistan That is why SAARC governments reached out to China Indias archrival for help ensuring the timely delivery of medical assistance On the other hand Khan could have chosen to assume the moral high ground by personally welcoming the SAARCbased initiative on urgent humanitarian grounds Even if such a response was motivated by an urge to call Modis bluff Khans standing as a global celebrity would potentially have benefitted millions of people in South Asia and beyond He certainly has the credentials for the job having built his political career on an impressive fundraising campaign to build Pakistans first charity cancer hospital Unfortunately the Khan administrations response to the new coronavirus outbreak in Pakistan has been as apathetic as its diplomacy Although the countrys first infections were documented on February 26 the government by Khans own admission did not treat the situation as a national emergency until the number of confirmed cases rose to 20 last week It did not even launch the requisite public awareness campaign until after Khan and his cabinet met with the countrys powerful generals By then disjointed attempts by the federal and provincial governments to prevent the spread of the disease from Iran had failed and the number of infections had begun to grow exponentially Khan in his first public speech on the matter on Tuesday told confused Pakistanis that an epidemic was inevitable but downplayed the number of fatalities and extent of suffering that it would cause Dont panic he urged scaring the wits out of them Meanwhile Afghanistans President Ashraf Ghani has been conspicuous by his absence Clearly preoccupied with preserving power after a dubious election and the US peace deal with the Taliban his government has made no effort to reach out to his political rivals in Kabul or the Taliban to discuss coordinated action against the spread of the disease despite the forcible repatriation of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees by Iran over the past few weeks Instead the job of dealing with the outbreak has fallen to the USled military coalition and the weak administrations of affected provinces All too aware of the selfish motivations for such callousness the US has increased pressure on Ghani to stop playing the spoiler but he has shown no sign of relenting Saddled with such leaders the people of South Asia are bound to suffer greatly as a result of such opportunism apathy and indifference They would be well advised to remember that depressing fact when Modi Khan and Ghani claim victory over the virus We welcome

an open friendship just as Israel plans its greatest usurpation of Palestinian land since 1967 Tuesday was a historic day for officials in Israel and Abu Dhabi as their previously clandestine friendship went public The landing of the Etihad Airways cargo flight was the first publicly acknowledged commercial flight between the UAE and Israel in their history For years now the two sides have enjoyed a close relationship but the Gulf state has been reluctant to make it official Abu Dhabis notorious surveillance operation relies on software sold to it by Israeli companies and the pair have common foreign policy stances on supporting the dictatorship of Abdel Fattah el Sisi in Egypt and countering Iranian influence in the Middle East There has also been limited diplomatic exchange between the states with Israeli Minister of Culture Miri Regev visiting Abu Dhabi in 2018 for a trip that included a tour of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Regev had previously shared a video in which Israeli football fans mock Arabs with the chant may your village be burned a reference to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians during the Nakba of 1947 and 1948 While the landing of the Etihad flight was a definite milestone in EmiratiIsraeli relations it seemed one side was doing most of the celebrating Israeli authorities including the foreign ministry shared a video of the plane on the tarmac at Tel Avivs David BenGurion Airport with proIsrael influencers and journalists celebrating the event The Israel advocacy group Stand With Us posted a Tweet that read A historical moment for Israel The firstever Etihad flight from the United Arab Emirates carrying coronavirus supplies for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank landed at BenGurion Airport in Tel Aviv late Tuesday evening While Israels UN envoy Danny Danon wrote For the first time an etihad cargo plane just landed at Israels BenGurion airport Hopefully soon we will see passenger flights too For the Israelis improving ties with the Emiratis is a major diplomatic achievement in a region where few Arab states formally recognise the country WATCH A historical moment for Israel The firstever Etihad flight from the United Arab Emirates carrying coronavirus supplies for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank landed at BenGurion Airport in Tel Aviv late Tuesday evening StandWithUs StandWithUs May 20 2020 Credit Israel Airports Authority pictwittercom2QLCge2l1C Acknowledging significance The Emirati side however were careful to frame the flight not in terms of their relationship with Israel but instead as humanitarian help to Palestinians Abu Dhabis statecontrolled WAM news agencies reported that the flight delivered aid To halt the spread of COVID19 pandemic and its impact in the occupied Palestinian territory As the Times of Israel points out in its report the UAE did not acknowledge the flight nor its significance As if to consciously deny any relation to the Emiratis the plane that delivered the aid did so without the familiar markings and decals of an Etihad airliner That raises the question of why it was hidden The rulers of the UAE could not have been unaware of how the timing of the flight could be seen as a diplomatic boost to Israel at a time when it is facing global pressure to halt its proposed annexation of the occupied West Bank home to the same Palestinians Abu Dhabi claims it wants to help with the delivery of the aid The optics dont get any better within the Arab and Muslim world as the flight came just days after Palestinians marked 72 years since the mass displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral lands in 1948 known as the nakba or catastrophe The UAEs Foreign Minister Abdullah al Nahyan has condemned the planned annexation calling it illegal and contradictory to attempts to find a peaceful solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict According to Tallha Abdulrazaq a Middle Eastern security expert at the University of Exeter is Strategy and Security Institute the UAE would look to the exceptional conditions of the coronavirus pandemic to explain the flight if it faced criticism over timing The Emiratis would easily argue that medical aid to combat Covid19 trumps any concerns about the annexation plans which the Emirati foreign ministry has condemned Abdulrazaq told TRT World That said It is no secret the UAE has been seeking closer ties with Israel for years due to shared interests in quelling democratic movements across the Middle East as well as the longstanding issue of threats coming from Iran There is copious evidence to suggest a process of normalisation is occurring despite no formal diplomatic relations between the two states Explaining why the Emirati plane appeared without its ordinary markings Abdulrazaq said that it was part of a tactic to gouge what reaction it would draw The lack of decals on the Emirati flight is intriguing in and of itself It would appear that they were in two minds about sending the flight directly to Israel for fear of how it would be perceived and tried a one foot in one foot out approach Im not sure it had the desired effect of reassuring audiences they were not really developing ties with Israel

institutions were formed to bring the states together to resolve any disputes through peace Following the First World War the League of Nations Cemiyeti Akvâm was established The United Nations UN was also established right after the Second World War But since the victorious states formed these unions after both world wars they were unable to bring the desired peace and tranquility to the world On the contrary they became the source of unrest Following the First World War the Paris Peace Conference convened to discuss the framework of the treaties to be concluded At its meeting on 25 January 1919 it was decided to establish a League of Nations that would ensure and maintain international peace and security The convention of the League of Nations prepared by the commission established to fulfill this decision was adopted by the Treaty of Versailles signed on 28 June 1919 It was established in Switzerland with the entry into force of the treaty on 10 January 1920 under the name League of Nations Cemiyeti Akvâm The purpose of this organization was to solve problems between countries by peaceful means but it failed to show a serious presence The League of Nations established after the First World War could not prevent the outbreak of the Second World War Following World War II it was disbanded in 1946 The concept of the United Nations was used for the first time by Franklin D Roosevelt during World War I for the allied countries It was not a structure that represented all the countries in the world as it is now understood but it was a concept that originally meant the allied states The allied forces at the time were precisely what was called United Nations combat forces On April 25 1945 850 representatives from 50 countries met at the San Francisco Conference and gave the final form to the 111article treaty which was unanimously adopted on June 25 1945 On 24 October 1945 the treaty was ratified by the majority of the member states and the United Nations UN was established with its head office in New York Trygve Lie the first secretarygeneral of the UN and John D Rockefeller Jr established contacts to build the UN building in New York Rockefeller purchased the slaughterhouse site where the present UN building stands and donated it to the UN Although the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Iran made efforts on issues such as a ceasefire in Kashmir it was De Lie who gave the greatest support for Israel is establishment which meant a declaration of war One of the first things the UN did was to secure the establishment of Israel Moreover although the UN has taken many decisions against Israeli state terrorism to the present date it has not implemented any of them With the Bretton Woods Agreement of July 1944 the monetary and financial system of the world was built This agreement also established the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank In 1971 the gold exchange standard which had been introduced with the Bretton Woods collapsed when the US abolished the convertibility of the dollar into gold There has been anarchy in the world monetary and financial system since 1971 In the same way since the UN was unable to prevent the wars that emerged from its foundation and since it has become a structure that legitimizes Israeli and American invasions global anarchy in the world continues The principles of a freemarket economy advocated by the United States as a hegemonic power after World War II shaped the functioning of the international finance and trade over the dollar The current structure of the UN and the work needed to be done The UN is a structure established 75 years ago based on the balance of political and military power The United Nations Security Council UNSC resolutions are taken on the condition that a motion issued by the member states is adopted by 9 of the 15 member states and does not receive a vote of rejection from one of the UNSC is permanent member states The UN has failed to ensure the peace and security which has been its main promise since its foundation As a result of this objections to the structure of the UNSC and the veto power of its 5 permanent members are rising The UN has put forward the institution of the UN Interim membership to ease the response and to stall the reactionaries But as such the UN has worked as a mechanism to perpetuate the atrocities of the sovereign and the powerful The United Nations was established with 51 countries Today there are 193 independent countries recognized by the UN in the world Even though 75 years have passed the number of countries in the world has quadrupled and the world has moved into the postdigital era the UN is still struggling to maintain the status quo and stay in the same structure The UNSC is trying to stall the world with its Temporary Membership Currently 142 countries are forced to comply with the decisions taken by these structures which were established at a time when these countries did not exist Today 56 members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation 27 of whom are also members of the African Union 54 members of the African Union and 32 members of the Latin American and Caribbean Union have no place in the UN Security Council and no veto rights Since there is no central authority to control and punish those who fail to comply with the agreements rules or resolutions signed by the UN today the UNSC member states exercise the power of the UN and when it is in their interests violate the conventionsresolutions There are over 60 institutions agencies funds and programs working under the umbrella of the UN With these organizations under its umbrella the UN regulates the international system on almost all issues such as health food environment development refugees asylum seekers international transport tourism What needs to be done now is to change the name of the UN starting with the name League of Nations again and then to change the structure of the UNSC to represent all regions The international system we live in today is world is a capitalist system that facilitates the affairs of the hegemonic and dominant forces International organizations such as the UN are the regulator and controller of the infrastructure of this global capitalist system This is a kind of modern new form of colonialism The world is bigger than five which President Erdogan has repeatedly stated at the UN meetings is important for the establishment of a new world and his rhetoric that the fate of humanity cannot be left to the elderly of a limited number of countries and that it is necessary to change the mentality and institutions The Role of the UN in the genocides The United States Russia China France and the United Kingdom which are the five permanent members of the UNSC with the power of veto are also the countries that produce and market the most weapons in the world It is futile to expect the Security Council which is composed of the leading actors of the world arms trade to contribute permanently to world peace The sources of these conflicts are themselves not just the protectors of wars and conflicts What is important for the capitalist system is the sale of weapons it is of no value to whom it kills unless it is directed towards itself Therefore the peacekeeping troops sent by the UN to prevent the conflicts operate as a fighting force For example the soldiers of some Western countries mainly France and the Netherlands who served under the UN umbrella in Rwanda have been implicated in genocide The mission of the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda was in Canada The UNSC did not allow the peacekeepers to stop the massacre Thousands of people who had taken refuge there were killed after soldiers were removed from the school where Belgian soldiers had settled in Kigali The UN has completely failed On June 22 1994 the UNSC allowed France to send troops to Goma in Congo for humanitarian assistance under the name of the turquoise mission But France helped the Hutu army and its militants instead of protecting the Tutsis that were murdered there Thousands of Tutsis were killed in the Frenchcontrolled area French soldiers fought against the Rwandan Patriotic Front Moreover it was revealed that the UN troops stationed in the Democratic Republic of Congo had supplied the rebel militias with gold and ivory and that the rebels had committed genocide in Rwanda with these weapons supplied by the UN But all of these were covered up UN officials said they were unable to deepen the investigation for political reasons Britain committed genocide against Kenyans who revolted for independence in Kenya in 1952 murdering tens of thousands of Kenyans and suppressing the independence struggle During the Cold War the United States killed between 1 and 2 million people in Vietnam nearly 1 million died in a CIAbacked army coup in Indonesia and many died in Cambodia between 196975 due to the bombings starvation and political turmoil Besides governments in several countries have been ousted with US support On the other hand the UN did not account for any of these United Nations and the Islamic world Since its inception no Muslim has been elected to the Office of UN SecretaryGeneral Butros Gali was elected from Egypt but he was also a Christian Turkey can also mobilize the Organization of Islamic Cooperation the D8 and the Turkish Republic to elect a Muslim person to the UN SecretaryGeneral This will also pave the way for reform at the UN Of the 60 subagencies and organizations of the UN none of the most important ones is in a central Islamic country Only the headquarters of the West Asian Economic and Social Council ESCWA a trivial organization whose accomplishments are unclear is located in Beirut the Lebanese capital There is also the United Nations Relief for Palestinian Refugees UNRWA a Gazabased organization with 20 thousand employees wherever they work now who claim that they are helping refugees in Palestine where Israel is terrorizing them The UN has also remained silent against the US is destruction injustice and lawlessness in the Islamic world The United States massacred thousands in Lebanon in 1983 As the societies of the countries in the Islamic world slowly began to have a real say it worked to destabilize and destroy them With the invasion of Iraq after the US attack on the Gulf in 1990 for the first time since the Mongols Baghdad experienced such devastation over a million people died in the process The United Nations Security Council which accepts the wardership of the interests of the United States as its first duty has adopted a resolution on December 4 1992 to rescue the Somali people from the famine drama in Somalia embarked on a military operation under the name Operation Hope The purpose of this occupation movement called Operation Hope was to plunge Somalia into deep chaos and they succeeded in it Somalia still has not recovered The brutal genocide in Bosnia is another dark chapter in the history of the United Nations In 1993 the UN declared Srebrenica a safe zone for Bosnians Thousands of Bosnians had taken refuge at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping force made up of Dutch soldiers The weapons in the hands of Muslims had been collected by the UN peacekeepers on protection grounds Upon the siege of the camp by Serbian forces the UN troops personally handed over thousands of Bosnians to the Serbs in 1995 causing them to suffer genocide The UN has yet to account for this After Iraq Afghanistan was invaded on the pretext of September 11 When it was not enough Tunisia Egypt Libya Yemen and finally Sudan was plunged into chaos during the Arab Spring In the Middle East the United States bombed Afghanistan and Iraq with the aim of bringing democracy to the oppressed and those living in undemocratic conditions It is trying to erase the traces of the Islamic civilization that was built lived and still lives on this land by mass killing and displacing the people in this region Muslim societies and the people of the oppressed third world countries or socalled failed states are fed up with the treatment hurtful behavior and degrading treatment of their leaders at the international meetings These people are in the expectations of our country because of its historical background and its role in history COVID19 UN and WHO The process of the new type coronavirus COVID19 has shown that the developments in one region of the world affect all other countries In the past famine civil wars the devastation of powerful countries like the United States and Russia around the world and the cries of the millions they killed were unheard of in Washington in London in Paris or Moscow For the first time the citizens of these countries have experienced the cold face of death in a massive sense They have seen that death could find not only third world countries but also themselves Nations that made no noise and approved while their states rained bombs on innocent people saw the cold face of death as it appeared from television screens Of course pain is huge and very hard It is hoped that this process will reignite human feelings of compassion towards each other and towards nature and remind humans of their humanity In the process of COVID19 the World Health Organization WHO operating under the UN has failed to uncover the structure of this virus to provide sufficient information to the world and to prevent the outbreak The WHO was able to explain this figure without a single study confirming the 34 percent mortality estimation The WHO has to explain which academic studies and press organizations are involved in COVID19 manipulation Having witnessed medical fraud and false outbreak reports before the WHO has turned into a subcontracting mechanism for the world vaccine lobby As a result of these failures even the US today announced it would suspend the funding to the WHO Brazil is also about to leave However what needs to be done is to completely change the structure of the UN Conclusion This already decadent world order is built on blood and tears Structures that are condemned to capitalist ambitions callous soulless unscrupulous and do not pay attention to human whose compassion has diedkilled cannot bring peace to the world We hope that as a result of this epidemic process all of the UN member states will be able to support the establishment of 75 countries They cooperate in reforming the UN and establishing an equitable world order If this is not done greater domination over humanity will be established with digitized lifeforms What they could not do even in the atomic age they would do in digitized life The writer is the Chairman of the African Center for Strategic

Covid19 could not have picked a worse time to make its appearance on the world stage Of course there could never have been a good time for this pestilence to ravage the globe but its darkly ironic that the virus has emerged at such a bleak time in history The already shaky global democratic order as the defining principles of international law and human rights has been terminally weakened by a series of interconnected events that stretch from 911 and the subsequent mass criminality of the war on terror to the reemergence of genocide on the world stage in Syria The definitive language of this era is authoritarianism erupting around the globe including in zones of the world that many thought were immune to that particular affliction in the postCold War era In Europe for example over the past decade or so weve seen an increase in the hybridisation of authoritarianism and democracy illiberal democracy or postfascism as it has been termed The ground zero for this particular outbreak was Hungary with the now decadelong rule of the openly illiberal and opportunistic authoritarian Viktor Orban Orbans infamy is primarily focused on his antiimmigrant crusade leading to him clashing with but more often than not shaping EU policy towards refugees asylum seekers and nonEU migrants Muslims are a particular target of hate for the despot who claims to be standing up for Christian culture But since then Orban has been joined on the European and global stage by a wide range of politically similar figures and parties whether as governing or electoral forces But its no surprise that Hungary is the first country to fall victim to what might be termed a Covid19 coup Using the virus as a pretext Orban has suspended parliamentary democracy and the judicial and executive checks on his power Orban passed a law that allows him to rule by decree for an indefinite period with the national state of emergency caused by the Covid19 pandemic as the main justification behind this power grab Orban is eradicating democracy by arguing that his government cannot react quickly to Covid19 if there are debates and lengthy legislative and lawmaking procedures Democracy is identified as the main hindrance to saving Hungary from Covid19 In reality Orbans new powers finally lift the mask that he has so unwillingly worn for a decade No more will he have to put up with the inconvenience of elections or the scrutiny of the already weak critical media and political opposition with all legislative elections suspended until Orban says otherwise Journalists or even opposition politicians who are deemed to state or disseminate any untrue fact or any misrepresented untrue fact that is capable of hindering or preventing the efficiency of protection is guilty of a felony Make no mistake about it given Orban even before this power grab waged war against civil society including the media civil rights NGOs and universities this law is designed to eradicate criticism of him For he according to him and his party Fidesz is the ultimate protector of Hungary The penalty for this felony is one to five years in prison But of course at a time when information and not censorship could save lives when it comes to Covid19 many doctors and health professionals who want to speak out about Orbans exceptionally lax medical response to the epidemic have now been gagged Instead of taking the necessary steps to fight the epidemic Orban has blamed the spread of Covid19 on foreigners The presence of foreign students is cited as the reason why universities but not schools have been closed in the country But while Hungary is perhaps the worst case these assaults on democracy under the pretext of fighting Covid19 are widespread A wave Meanwhile in Israel Benjamin Netanyahu who shouldve been deposed and possibly locked up a long time ago continues to rule Israel Now he rules with an iron fist using the Covid19 outbreak to suspend the Knesset and the judicial system which was just about to try him for corruption charges In the US Donald Trump has used the Covid19 virus to suppress voting At the same time he politicises the Coronavirus press conferences to make them more about him peddling disinformation lies and bluster about his brilliance Any questions about the fact that states have been left hugely underresourced due to his botched reaction to the outbreak are met with accusations of fake news with him famously claiming Democrats were hyping Covid19 to bring down his presidency There is a balance to be struck between measured lockdowns rooted in democracy that have clear public health benefits and using the genuine threat of the disease to eradicate or further weaken democracy and human rights Its of no surprise that in places such as Italy and Spain where real horror and tragedy are occurring as they battle the virus China and Russia have stepped in to fill the humanitarian void left by the EU which was sluggish to react to the needs of its member states Italy which only seven months ago had an authoritarian fascist as its deputy prime minister should not be chided for accepting the support of China and Russia but both fascist groups within Italy and the regimes of China and Russia are exploiting the situation to forge another level of antiEU propaganda and mythos One of the reasons Covid19 became a global pandemic was due to the authoritarian denialism of the Chinese state but even now Chinas authoritarian model is being praised Democracy has been recast as an impediment in the fight against Covid19 while opportunistic state forces are rapidly overturning civil liberties and human rights The fear is that the changes will be permanent Covid19 has exposed the weaknesses in modern democracies particularly along the lines of economic models that place market forces before health and welfare but the reaction to this must be a bolstering of democratic values that fed into the creation of health systems and welfare states in the first place not their abolition The human cost of Covid19 is already much too high but the sociopolitical cost could yet be more fundamentally destructive Democracy could yet be the gravest casualty of this pandemic We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion please send them via email to opinioneditorialtrtworldcom

an urgent plea for funding to shore up their operations in wartorn Yemen saying they have already been forced to stop some of their work even as the coronavirus rips through the country Some 75 of UN programs in Yemen have had to shut their doors or reduce operations The global body is World Food Program had to cut rations in half and UNfunded health services were reduced in 189 out of 369 hospitals nationwide It is almost impossible to look a family in the face to look them in the eyes and say Im sorry but the food that you need in order to survive we have to cut in half Lise Grande resident UN coordinator for Yemen told The Associated Press The dwindling funds are the result of several factors but among the top reasons is obstruction by Yemen is Houthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa and other territories The United States one of the largest donors decreased its aid to Yemen earlier this year citing interference by the Houthis It is yet to be seen whether the Houthis will allow monitoring and oversight or give UN agencies the space to operate A UN pledging conference for Yemen on June 2 seeks 241 billion to cover essential activities from June to December Grande said the Houthis are working to become more transparent and that she hopes this will encourage donor countries to give aid Her optimism however comes as the Houthis face heavy criticism for suppressing information about the number of COVID19 cases and fatalities in areas they control while putting no mitigation measures in place June 2 is conference will be cohosted for the first time by Saudi Arabia a major player in Yemen is civil war since it first unleashed a bombing campaign in 2015 to try to push back the Iranianbacked Houthis who had seized the northern half of the country Critics question the Saudis highprofile role in rallying humanitarian support even as they continue to wage a war as do the Houthis that has created the world is worst humanitarian crisis Maysaa Shuja alDeen a Yemeni researcher and a nonresident fellow at the Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies said the kingdom is trying to repair its international image by changing the conversation Saudi Arabia has always tried to change the narrative of the war and present itself as a backer of the legitimate government not part of the conflict she said In past years the kingdom has been one of the top donors for UN humanitarian aid operations in Yemen The Saudi ambassador to Yemen Mohammed alJaber said the kingdom will allocate half a billion dollars this year to support UN programs including 25 million for a COVID19 response plan The UN itself has also investigated allegations of corruption and diversion of aid in Yemen in its own ranks Reports indicate that the coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate throughout the country Among the slashed programs is financial support to thousands of health workers who have not received salaries from the government for nearly three years Grande said that just a week before the first coronavirus case was announced in Yemen aid agencies had to stop paying health workers Without salaries medical staff will not be able to provide health services to patients amid the pandemic The UN received around 36 billion in 2019 in international donations for its campaign short of its 42 billion goal For its 2020 plan it has so far received only 15 out of the needed 35 billion Yemen has been caught in a grinding war since 2014 when Houthi rebels descended from their northern enclave and took over Sanaa forcing the internationally recognized president to flee In the spring of 2015 a USbacked Saudiled coalition began a destructive air campaign to dislodge the Houthis while imposing a land sea and air embargo on Yemen The air war and fighting on the ground has killed more than 100000 people shut down or destroyed half of Yemen is health facilities and driven 4 million Yemenis from their homes Cholera epidemics and severe malnutrition among children have led to thousands of additional deaths As the war enters its sixth year with no sign of a viable ceasefire the suffering looks set to continue Fighting has continued unabated along several front lines in Yemen including in Marib an oilrich eastern province threatening new waves of displacement The UNs massive aid program totaling 835 billion since 2015 is vital to keeping many Yemenis alive Ten million people are on the brink of famine and 80 of the 30 million population are in need of aid according to the UN With the coronavirus spreading more money is needed Since April authorities in areas controlled by Yemen is internationally recognized government reported 283 cases including 85 deaths The Houthis declared only four cases including one death The World Health Organization believes that there is a significant underestimation of the outbreak which could further hinder efforts to get supplies into Yemen that are needed to contain the virus Richard Brennan the WHO is regional emergency director told the AP that he believes the deaths are in the hundreds and cases in the thousands based on what he is heard from numerous health care providers But he said the lack of funding means the organization is health programs are hanging by a thread The International Rescue Committee an aid group said Yemen is conducting just 31 tests per one million people among the world is lowest scores With increasing needs and fewer funds the UN refugee agency will have to stop cash assistance and shelter programs for more than 50000 displaced families by August said spokeswoman Heba Kanso She said the agency will be forced to end its partnership with dozens of Yemeni NGOs that will have let go more than 1500 national staff Relief agencies worry that donors will give less as many countries struggle their own virus outbreaks But they warn that the world is worst humanitarian crisis can indeed get much worse The world is attention is diverted elsewhere and these are the vulnerable among the most vulnerable on the planet and we need a commitment said Brennan

Europe moved to keep its borders shut for another month Hopes have been rising that the worst of the global catastrophe which has killed more than 270000 people has passed and the United States on Friday approved a new athome saliva test to speed up diagnosis for Covid19 But after weeks in which half of humanity was restricted from carrying on normal life the effects have been painfully visible with the global economy suffering its most acute downturn in nearly a century In the US 205 million jobs were wiped out in April the most ever reported with unemployment rising to 147 percent the highest since the Great Depression The world is largest economy has suffered the deadliest coronavirus outbreak with more than 77000 fatalities and nearly 13 million cases Mindful of elections in

pandemic A Red Square parade has been postponed and President Vladimir Putin will instead give a 20minute speech at a war memorial inside the Kremlin walls No unity at UN Far from bringing the world together the crisis has triggered a war of words between China where the virus first appeared in the metropolis of Wuhan and the US where Trump has battled criticism over his handling of an epidemic which he boasted of having under control in January The Trump administration has brought into the mainstream a theory that the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory despite the World Health Organization and the top US epidemiologist saying there is no evidence China rejects the charge and America is allies are not convinced The feud spread Friday to the UN Security Council where the United States stunning other members prevented a vote on a resolution that called for a ceasefire in various conflicts around the world The resolution led by France and Tunisia called for a cessation of hostilities in conflict zones and a 90day humanitarian pause to allow governments to better address the pandemic among those suffering most Diplomats said the United States was concerned about language in the resolution on the role of the World Health Organization which has been at the forefront of confronting Covid19 Trump has vowed to freeze the more than 400 million in annual US funding for the UN body saying it did not act quickly enough when the mysterious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan and blindly took the word of China The US State Department on Friday also accused China and Russia of sharply escalating disinformation online about the virus including promoting conspiracy theories that it was cooked up by US scientists Home tests Researchers in Hong Kong have found that patients suffering milder illness caused by the new coronavirus recover more quickly if they are treated with a threedrug antiviral cocktail soon after symptoms appear Authors of the study published in The Lancet on Friday called for largerscale research to ascertain if the drug combo could be a viable treatment for criticallyill patients With the US death toll and infections still climbing regulators on Friday offered a way to ramp up testing a significantly simpler home diagnostic kit that uses saliva Public health workers warn that a complete return to normal is impossible until the development of a vaccine which could take months if not more Trump however has suggested that a vaccine is not a prerequisite to ending the pandemic At some point it will probably go away by itself he told reporters while adding if we had a vaccine that would be very helpful

try and contain the global pandemic Africa has been largely spared But that is changing In fact many experts are warning that the continent is facing a looming Covid19 crisis Without question the consequences of this disease spreading across Africa could be extremely devastating Although the global pandemic has been slow to reach Africa every country on the continent except Lesotho Comoros and Sao Tome and Principe has cases Disturbingly the number of cases continues rising across Africa Within the continent South Africa is the most coronavirusinfected with around 1900 cases and Egypt has the highest death toll which has surpassed 100 With the worlds most underresourced healthcare systems malnutrition other diseases measles malaria diarrhoea cholera etc along with large swathes of ungoverned land many African countries are extremely vulnerable to coronavirus Most are in a weak position to cope with the disease should Covid19 prove to be a time bomb waiting to explode across Africa Given how much difficulty Italy Spain the United States and other economically developed countries are having in terms of dealing with coronavirus it is scary to think about what this pandemic could do to the worlds poorest continent which is home to 12 billion people South Sudan the latest African country to officially announce its first coronavirus case is an example For a country with 11 million citizens and only four ventilators it is a gross understatement to say that South Sudans healthcare system lacks the resources required Most African countries do not have any more than ten hospitals beds per 10000 people highlighting how difficult it will be for nations throughout the continent to cope Costs of conflict Consequences of years of warfare in several African countries can play out in extremely negative ways in terms of Covid19 Damaged infrastructure will make it harder for people to access healthcare facilities in areas which witness skyrocketing infection rates Many in the West may forget that having the means to social distance amid this pandemic is a privilege To be sure this is not a privilege extended to most refugees and displaced persons across the world let alone Africa Struggling to overcome the South Sudanese Civil War 20132020 South Sudan has a high number of citizens displaced by violent conflict and many of them are living in overcrowded sites with poor sanitary conditions Sadly South Sudan is not alone in this regard Burkina Faso Chad Kenya Nigeria and other African countries are home to millions of refugees and displaced persons When thinking about the hundreds of thousands of people living in Kenyas Dadaab and Kakuma camps it is easy to imagine how quickly the virus could spread given how closely these camps inhabitants live next to each other and how difficult it is for them to access soap and clean water Ultimately ongoing conflicts in Africa are even more dangerous to the security of the continent amid this pandemic In the western part of Ethiopias Oromia Region the government is waging a counterinsurgency which prompted officials in Addis Ababa to shut down the internet and phone lines in this area of the country Consequently millions of Ethiopians were unable to acquire information about Covid19 until their government restored access in western Oromia a week ago due to pressure from various groups who saw the cutting off of information about this pandemic to any part of Ethiopia as a threat to all citizens health and safety Meanwhile Libyas civil war rages on despite coronavirus arrival to the country meaning that Libyan resources will continue to be funnelled into the conflict instead of efforts aimed at dealing with the pandemic Moreover there is a credible risk of extremists such as Islamic State Daesh taking advantage of this pandemic in Libya to advance their hateful agendas Already General Khalifa Haftars Libyan National Army LNA has taken advantage of the international communitys distractions to intensify its attacks on Tripoli despite calls from the UN for truces in all armed conflicts to help the world cope with this pandemic Travel Restrictions In terms of travel restrictions there are myriad challenges that will be particularly difficult to address in Africa For example as Human Rights Watch has warned travel restrictions in South Sudan risk disrupting ongoing efforts to provide humanitarian relief which also applies to other countries on the continent Moreover as the Council on Foreign Relations John Campbell recently wrote borders in Africa are porous and the efficacy of travel restrictions in curbing the spread of the virus remains unclear While many African countries are facing stagnant economic growth the coronavirus threatens to impose enormous economic costs on the continent Up to ten percent of Africas GDP is expected to be wiped out as a consequence of ongoing lockdowns in numerous countries Lacking the resources to bail out their economies these governments do not have the means to take care of their poorest citizens who are suffering or at least will suffer from job loss For African daily wagers it is difficult to exaggerate how dire their situations could become if coronavirus ravages their countries International communitys response With nearly every African country reporting coronavirus cases the continent is bracing for the pandemic to become more severe and quickly overwhelm Africas already weak public health and social welfare systems The continent will suffer from major revenue losses broken supply chains and stunted economic growth Undoubtedly further actions taken by African leaders to contain this disease on top of policies and measures already implemented such as bans on flights from certain countries closing international borders imposing lockdowns and curfews etc will make a significant difference Yet there is no denying that the international community has a role to play Covid19 spiralling out of control in any country is a threat to all countries States with extra resources that have managed to contain the spread of coronavirus within their borders must step up to help impoverished nations across the African continent trying to do the same especially before it is too late Otherwise the virus will be able to continue spreading across the world recognising no international boundaries between countries Amid this unprecedented global crisis international state and nonstate actors must find new ways to cooperate in a struggle against a common enemy that continues spreading death in all corners of the world In 2011 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke before the UN General Assembly about Somalia and the lack of support which it received from wealthier countries during times of tragedy The international community is watching the suffering in Somalia like a movie However we should urgently face this situation which is a test to our humanity The tragedy of Somalia where tens of thousands of children died due to the lack of even a piece of bread and a drop of water is a shame for the international community Today the Covid19 crisis allows the international community to make up for its past record of failing to do enough not only for Somalia but the African continent at large Doing so would be not only in the interest of Africans but of

have permission from male family members to travel outside the country with their children Sudans ruling body the Transitional Sovereignty Council TSC has ratified a set of sweeping changes to the countrys penal code that include banning the practice of female genital mutilation FGM and allowing nonMuslims to consume alcohol The reforms are part of a bid to implement its constitutional mandate and strengthen its democratic transition Anyone found guilty of performing FGM will be sentenced up to three years in prison Other amendments include abolishing the death penalty for apostasy and no longer requiring women to have permission from male family members to travel outside the country with their children Public flogging will also be banned Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok hailed the decision as an important step in reforming the justice system Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari said the amendments to the 1991 Criminal Law originally introduced by the disposed Omar alBashir government are designed to safeguard citizens rights as promised in the countrys constitutional charter We cancelled the Article 126 of the Sudanese Criminal Law and have ensured religious freedom and the equality in citizenship and rule of law he said All these changes are aiming at achieving equality in front of the laws We have dropped all the articles that had led to any kind of discrimination We ensure our people that the legal reformation will continue until we drop all the laws violating the human rights in Sudan Abdulbari added that a commission to study laws and recommend reforms will be set up shortly Article 152 which was used to regulate womens dress code and behaviour was also repealed Criminal justice reforms were a crucial part of the popular protest movements demands to secularise the state and the announcements over the weekend will have been welcomed by civil society groups said Patricia Rodrigues an analyst specialising in East Africa for the geopolitical advisory firm Control Risks The announcement also follows other reforms introduced in December 2019 that amended Public Order Laws to allow women more civil liberties She added that the developments will be viewed favourably by domestic and international human rights groups and potentially improve the global perception of the transitional administration While the move to ban FGM has been welcomed by womens rights groups the practice remains deeprooted in conservative quarters of Sudanese society and implementation is likely to pose a challenge In neighbouring Egypt where FGM was banned in 2008 and elevated to a felony in 2016 nine of 10 Egyptian women were still reported to have undergone the procedure with around 80 percent carried out by medical professionals Some activists questioned the timing saying that the Covid19 pandemic puts them at a disadvantage since awareness campaigns cannot be mobilised nor can law enforcement training be conducted Currently there are fuel shortages and long daily power cuts as well as rising infections of Covid19 said Nahid Toubia a leading Sudanese womens health rights activist specialising in FGM Communication and peoples mobility are severely hampered These are not the conditions where advocacy for legislating against FGM is a priority or even possible Still the moves symbolic and consequential nature cannot be downplayed Legal reviews and amendments will continue Hamdok pledged until we address all distortions in the legal systems in Sudan Pushback The current Hamdockled transitional government took over from Omar al Bashir who came to power in 1989 in an alliance with conservative hardliners and used the prevailing 30 years to enforce strict Islamic laws under his autocratic rule The spate of amendments ratified by the TSC were strongly opposed by voices from the countrys religious establishment including some from hardline groups that made up sections of the previous administration AbdelHay Youssef the ultraconservative preacher slammed the TSC chairman AbedFatah al Burhan and his deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo Hemedti The issuance of amendments to the criminal law confirms to every fair person what those concerned said long ago that this government came as a war against virtues and an aggression against the nations religion and identity said the cleric who is believed to be in selfexile in Turkey Youssef called on the army to step in to defend the law of God adding that Burhan and Hemedti betrayed God and his messenger Uprooting this obscene government is a mandatory duty obligation of every capable person he added This was echoed by Mohamed Ali Al Juzooli the head of state of the Law and Development Party LDP who urged the armed forces to overthrow a government that he deemed to be a foreign project Salafist preacher Mohamed AbdelKareem also called for demonstrations to protest the amendments Head of the Just Peace Forum JPF Tayeb Mustafa said the government had come to fight God and his Messenger and described cabinet ministers as antiIslam secularists and communists But this rhetorical pushback might not amount to anything substantive Such groups have organised protests against the current administration earlier this year but their networks of political and financial power are in the process of being dismantled said Rodrigues This means that while they may organise further protests they will largely be unable to prevent these changes from being implemented in the coming months A fragile transition The amendments come amid the backdrop of fresh protests demanding faster and more comprehensive reforms from transitional authorities Radical sociopolitical transformation was a crucial part of Sudans nonviolent revolution which led to the overthrow of the Bashir military regime last April The popular protests slogan of Freedom peace and justice represented the yearning of many Sudanese civil society which led to a negotiation process culminating in a transitional political structure tasked with turning those dreams into tangible rulings The civilianled transitional government formed in September has faced a number of challenges inherited after decades of political oppression and economic mismanagement as it shepherds the country for three years until democratic elections in 2022 The Hamdock government has to also delicately balance the expectations of the civilian movement and economic liberalisation with the powerful interests of the military who continue to retain significant influence in political and economic affairs Any attempt at transitioning from dictatorship to a democratic system is fraught with formidable challenges While Sudan embarks on a path toward democratic and accountable government economic fragility threatens to derail its transition Deteriorating economic conditions the primary driver for the protests has only exacerbated political and economic strain in the midst of a pandemic Sudan is among the most affected African countries in terms of confirmed Covid19 cases and deaths An unsustainable fuel subsidy policy is in desperate need of reform and has contributed to the countrys growing fiscal deficit and debt which stands at 60 billion Inflation topped 100 percent last month and its currency has plunged to 141 to the dollar on the black market compared to 55 at the official rate With an estimated 65 percent of its 44 million people living in poverty the stakes for economic reform are high UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has implored that Sudan be allowed to access the international assistance necessary to confront the pandemic citing worsening health and economic impacts as well as the potential of unthinkable negative spillovers on regional and global stability Sudans constitutional charter calls for a range of legal and institutional reforms many that have yet to materialise The fresh batch of legal changes will help mollify some of those concerns and act as a signal to international donors The reforms will work to demonstrate to domestic and international audiences that Hamdoks administration is serious about human rights issues said Rodrigues These changes may improve Sudans relations with Western countries more generally and also boost the prospects for the removal of Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism by the US and thereby unlock muchneeded emergency financial assistance for Sudan However the ultimate goal of removing Sudan from the US State Department list which it has been on since 1993 remains a significant challenge one that might have a lasting impact on the success or failure of the transitional government The denial of access to development assistance and concessional loans along with the deterring global banks from dealing with Sudan leaves it subject to assistance from countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia which have opportunistic political interests linked to their support The Friends of Sudan group which enlists the USA UK France Germany UAE Saudi Arabia Egypt and Ethiopia claims to support the democratic transition and economic reforms set out in Sudans constitution Khartoums geostrategic position spanning the Horn and North Africa make it integral for many of those states foreign policy objectives in the region Last month foreign donors guaranteed 18 billion to ease Sudans economic pain The EU pledged 350 million the US earmarked 356 million while the UAE and Saudi Arabia donated 50 million and 10 million respectively However it is still well below the 8 billion in aid Hamdok said was needed over two years to turnaround Sudans crisisridden economy and recover the oil revenues it lost when South Sudan seceded in 2011 For now it appears the Sudanese economy will continue to be fragile albeit with humanitarian aid flows preventing an economic collapse Rodrigues declared

the daily Sabah on his weekend column suggested that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been troubled with two recent developments at a moment when his government has been intensely trying to tackle the spread of the coronavirus One of them Barlas argued was an initiative by the head of the Presidency of Religious Affairs Diyanet Ali Erbaş Although the mosques were shut down and Friday prayers were all suspended as part of massive measures to curb the spread of the virus Erbaş held a special Friday prayer on March 27 for a handful of selected people in Ankara Veteran journalist Barlas said Erdoğan knew about Erbaşs move late Friday only after the prayer occurred and felt very uncomfortable The second and perhaps more important development that has drawn Erdoğans reaction was the holding of the first tender of the Kanal Istanbul project according to Barlas who claimed that this untimely move would be the main reason behind the sudden dismissal of Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Cahit Turhan via a midnight presidential decree The journalist gives the impression that Erdoğan was unaware of both interventions beforehand Many others however object to this characterization on the grounds that the governance system has been very much centralized and under full control of the president since the executivepresidential system entered into force in July 2018 As highlighted by Barlas those who follow Turkish politics closely in Ankara link the removal of the Transportation Minister with the untimely Kanal Istanbul tender But not only that Turhans dismissal has a deeper background Transportation and infrastructure have always been very important for Erdoğans Justice and Development Party AKP governments since it came to power late 2002 It has placed multibilliondollar projects for the improvement of land air and sea routes through the construction of airports across the country including gigantic Istanbul Airport the bridges linking Asia to Europe through the 3rd Bosporus Bridge and the Dardanelles Bridge as well as the highspeed trains at the core of its economic activities in the last two decades The Transportation Ministry is therefore a ministry Erdoğan attaches great importance to and it was wellknown that he was not happy with the performance of outgoing Minister Turhan specifically due to his slowness and lack of enthusiasm over the Kanal Istanbul Dubbed the crazy project by many as it aims to create an artificial seaway linking the Black Sea with the Marmara Sea as well as a new residential settlement on the two banks of the channel Kanal Istanbul is recognized as Erdoğans major objective to reach in the next period Its believed that Turhan was late in accomplishing the preparations for opening the first tenders of the project and in coordinating related works with other ministries He however held the tender at the worst timing possible Additionally Turhan has also been criticized for not sufficiently contributing to the governments efforts to stem the spread of the virus He wanted to indirectly respond to this criticism at the handover ceremony where he was replaced by his deputy Adil Karaismailoğlu over the weekend Underlining that his ministry has acted early in the fight against the coronavirus he said During this period it has operated and continued its activities domestically and internationally in line with the decisions of our Health Ministry and team of experts Thankfully by implementing these measures we have not had major issues in our social or economic lives As a ministry we must implement our governments decisions together and attempt to overcome this disaster with as little damage as possible I felt the need for these words as I am leaving my position Another reason for this replacement is the visible impact of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu of the main opposition Republican Peoples Party CHP who was elected to lead Turkeys largest metropole in a rerun election in June 2019 As a young and very active mayor İmamoğlu continues to play a central role in delivering services in Istanbul and humanitarian aid to the poor amid economic difficulties and ongoing outbreak By the appointment of Karaismailoğlu a younger politician known for his loyalty to Erdoğan since the mid1990s at the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality the AKP government hopes to observe a more tough opposition against İmamoğlu in Istanbul Karaismailoğlu had to leave his position as the deputy secretarygeneral at the Istanbul Municipality after İmamoğlu won the elections He was then appointed as the deputy transportation minister The dismissal of Turhan marks an important development as its the first replacement in the cabinet since July 2018 revisiting the questions on whether Erdoğan will resort to a more substantial reshuffle amid the continued fight against the coronavirus

year 2020 began with Iranians witnessing the downing of a civilian airliner and their country emerging as the epicentre of an epidemic As Iranians in the Islamic Republic and Iranians around the world commemorate Persian New Year it is a solemn occasion for them including my family as our first relative there passed away from Covid19 Despite these twin traumas there was an American callousness to the Others suffering particularly in the early phases when Covid19 was only an epidemic in China and Iran and had not evolved into a pandemic When it began it was metaphorically Asian virus then Middle Eastern virus and it continues to be regarded as a Chinese virus by Americas president During these initial phases there were projections of how China and Irans public health catastrophes would bring down the Communist Party or the Islamic Republic a geopolitical schadenfreude of sorts In both cases the resilience of both China and Iran was underestimated as was the virus itself which went on to infect the US The vilification of China as the Sick Man of Asia One of the first salvos of American schadenfreude was launched in midFebruary from the Wall Street Journal with a piece entitled China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia written by Walter Russell Mead who writes a weekly column on foreign affairs for the paper The headline was criticised for its insensitivity and the editors of the paper issued a justification Most Americans however understand the phrase in the context of the dying Ottoman Empire as the sick man of Europe That was our historical analogy If one were to read between the lines the editors were asking that no offence be taken because they really meant to offend in the past tense Nonetheless the sick man reference to the Ottoman Empire was a term invoked by European powers on the eve of World War I to carve up exploit and stoke nationalist tensions within the Balkans Anatolia and the Arabian peninsula At the same time European powers had pounced on the sick Ottoman Empire they were doing the same to the Qing Empire of China exploiting it in the mid19th century to force the sale of British opium on the Chinese population or carving it up in zones of influence in the aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion around the turn of the twentieth century Regime change fantasies One might argue what the harm in a headline with an insensitive historical reference is The problem according to one Princeton academic is that there is a cottage industry of Western experts who assumed that the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party would occur as the coronavirus catastrophe would serve as Chinas version of Chernobyl the nuclear meltdown that contributed to the decline of the USSR Just as claims about the brittle nature of the Communist Party reflected wishful thinking so too do similar projections about the Islamic Republic of Iran Such claims can be found in Robert D Kaplans Wall Street Journal article Coronavirus and the Tragedy of Iran which writes The Islamic Republic has missed out on global prosperity and is now in its decadent lateSoviet stage In two cases The Wall Street Journal reveals itself as a cheerleader for regime change of China and Iran A similar vein is found in Graeme Woods article Coronavirus Could Break Iranian Society published in The Atlantic describes the epicentre of the outbreak the shrine city of Qom as a Shiite Disneyland In the article he criticised Mohammad Saeedi the head of the Fatima Masumeh shrine who allegedly opposed a quarantine but begged people to visit the shrine calling it a place of healing Wood writes At some point incompetence and evil become indistinguishable Yet Wood takes Saeedi comments out of context The tweet reads as follows Seyyed Mohammad Saeedi the representative of Khamenei in Qom the epicenter of cronavirus We call this holy shrine cronavirus epicenter Daralshafa means people come and heal from mental physical illnesses so they must be openirancoronavirus pictwittercomVoJoVHv5ez But if one were to listen to Saeedis entire statement he said We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing That means people should come here to heal from spiritual and physical diseases but of course we also exercise caution and comply with health and safety procedures Neglecting to mention the last line is a significant omission The suggestion is that the cleric prioritised faith over science neglecting the fact that the shrine has been sterilised just as other countries including the US seek to sterilise its mass transportation system From Saeedis single statement Wood generalises that it reflects the Islamic Republics frailty Urging visits to Qom I fear is the reaction of a government that has at last recognised its own limitations and has at some level embraced the virus The problem with articles like this is it focuses the fault of the Covid19 outbreak on Irans government while neglecting how sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that targeted humanitarian trade with Iran would have a greater impact on the Islamic Republics ability to deal with the outbreak than a shrine remaining open The sick man of North America The projection of regime change in China and Iran were written at a time when the virus seemed at a safe distance from American shores A month later entire American states ranging from California to Illinois would be shut down New York City has become Americas Qom and the US has surpassed the number of total cases in Iran and is on track to catch up to China Just as writers sought to analyse how the virus reflected the failure of public health governance in China and Iran the outbreak in the US revealed the inadequate measures Trump administration took to prepare eliminating pandemic experts from his staff and failing to heed intelligence warnings in January 2020 about the virus potential impact and finally the lack of testing equipment and ventilators While it was hoped that the virus might have resulted in regime change in China and Iran it might result in one in the US via the ballot box in November 2020 We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion please send them

Israel is one of the worsthit countries in the Middle East with more than 9000 infections and 86 confirmed deaths While neither government has officially commented on the move reports indicate that Israel is also expected to to allow shipments of aid to reach Palestinian in the occupied territories The two countries saw a deterioration in their bilateral partnership after Israel killed 10 civilians on Turkish flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip in 2010 It is uncertain whether the recent move by the Turkish government to authorise the export of humanitarian aid will heal the relationship

crowds and stay inside For refugees and migrants in the camps however those guidelines are privileges they do not have More than 60000 refugees and migrants reached Greece last year the largest number since the March 2016 European Union migration accord with Turkey The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR estimates that more than 112000 asylum seekers currently live in the country Of that total upwards of 35000 live in five Aegean island camps designed to accommodate a combined capacity of 5400 residents Growing number of cases Although there are no reported cases of the Coronavirus among refugees and migrants yet the number of confirmed cases has continued to grow in recent weeks As of Monday night the Greek government had the total tally of confirmed cases at 695 while at least 18 had died by Tuesday morning The government said 114 were in the hospital receiving treatment for the virus 35 of whom were in intensive care On Monday the Greek government enacted a full lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus including measures that restrict movement in cities towns and villages around the country That measure followed previous orders that closed down nonessential shops restaurants cafes and educational facilities In response to the mounting pandemic the Greek government introduced a measure restricting the movement of refugees and migrants on Greek islands last week The measures only allow camp residents to leave the premises between 7am and 7pm to retrieve food or necessary supplies for nearby towns according the Greek migration ministry Only one individual from each family is permitted to leave the camp at a time Protecting public health at any cost for the benefit of residents on the islands and in camps is our priority Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said Boris Cheshirkov an Athensbased spokesperson for the UNHCR explained that overcrowding has been a longstanding problem in the camps although the pandemic highlights the urgent need to solve it So far there have been no cases of the novel coronavirus among refugees and asylum seekers in Greece But thousands of refugees and asylum seekers in Greece including many who are older and vulnerable are in locations where health services are overstretched he told TRT World UNHCR has repeatedly alerted about the need to urgently improve living conditions there Hygiene and sanitation and access to health services are priority areas but the overcrowding has been a serious concern for months Dangerous Hampay says that refugees and migrantsespecially those in the campsare already bearing the brunt of the restrictions introduced to clamp down on the spread of the virus In the weeks leading up to the world shifting its focus on the COVID19 pandemic Greece came under widespread criticism for its management of the resurgent refugee crisis For weeks on the countrys land border with Turkey Greek forces fired tear gas flash bangs and live ammunition as tens of thousands of refugees and migrants amassed there according to Turkish authorities On Greek islands farright attackers assaulted refugees humanitarian workers and journalists on several occasions As tensions over the new wave of refugee arrivals crested however the Coronavirus pandemic erupted and captured the attention of the world But since the Coronavirus pandemic moved to the forefront of the public discussion the Greek government headed by the rightwing New Democracy party which came to power last July on promises of cracking down on migration has also seized the opportunity to further restrict refugees rights Last week with the streets of the capital largely empty Greek police raided and evicted a squat in central Athens where dozens of refugees and migrants lived It is dangerous Hampay said Now with the Coronavirus news no one sees the refugees now no one sees what is happening with the refugees in Greece

millions in the poorest countries have become more vulnerable to the economic downturn and food insecurity UN experts warn The World Food Program WFP said the economic outlook and risks of food insecurity continues to darken because of effects of the coronavirus pandemic posing further threats to regions in Africa that are already battling extreme poverty An estimated 265 million people could go hungry in 2020 nearly doubling 2019 figures according to latest WFP is forecasts Experts explain the way the global economic downturn is effecting lowincome economies is that it is becoming increasingly visible and acts through different channels Countries depending heavily on tourism remittances food imports or primary commodities exports are going to face a dire situation Susanna Sandstrom head of the WFP Economics and Markets Unit told Anadolu Agency She noted most vulnerable countries are those hit by not just one but several damaging factors at the same time and will not be able to protect themselves Key economic effects The first factor hurting vulnerable economies is the price of primary commodities which have plunged as the price of crude oil fell to record lows cutting export earnings vital for large parts of the developing world The second is tourism which contributes significantly to foreign exchange earnings in many fragile countries The UN World Tourism Organization expects international tourist arrivals to decline by as much as 30 percent in 2020 hitting countries in developing areas that base their economies on the flux of foreign tourists Remittances the third key channel through which the economic downturn reverberates on poor countries are responsible for up to 30 of gross domestic product in lowincome economies and are expected to fall dramatically as they did during the 2008 economic crisis Economists expect the flow of foreign direct investments to shrink by up to 40 in 2020 The other key factor impacting the poorest countries is the dependence on food imports which leaves those relying on imports exposed to the economic downturn and increased food insecurity That puts upward pressure on domestic prices at a time when households purchasing power is tumbling due to the large percentage of income lost amid the crisis The COVID19 pandemic and forced lockdowns that followed is taking a heavy toll globally in terms of unemployment The International Labor Organization ILO estimates a reduction in working hours in the second quarter of 2020 that is equivalent to 195 million fulltime workers Those people who were already living below the international poverty line now are also losing their jobs Those are the ones who risk the highest damage said Sandstrom She stressed economic insecurity due to the stopping of remittances and job loss translates into food insecurity which is also aggravated by increasing food prices The areas at highest risk are mostly countries in Africa that were already facing economic problems and food insecurity said Sandstrom citing South Sudan Nigeria Angola and the Middle East She noted the struggling population of refugees living in camps is particularly exposed to sanitary and the economic effects of the pandemic which are often combined with other distressing factors This is happening for instance in Bangladesh where the pandemic crisis has coupled with the monsoon season she said WFP is role To help vulnerable populations cope with the pandemic and its economic fallout the WFP is focusing on maintaining effective operations despite the sanitary emergency We are sustaining our operations around the world making sure that the distribution of food or cash transfers can be made respecting security and sanitary conditions said Sandstrom The WFP is cooperating with local governments to help build safety nets able to shield people who are losing jobs and becoming exposed to extreme poverty Sandstrom noted the COVID19 crisis is often has a heavier effect on urban areas due to the income effect People in the countryside can still provide food to themselves by farming she said While people in the urban areas are more dependent on market food Another critical issue for WFP is the closure of schools in poor countries where many families receive food aid through the school meal programs We had to find other ways to reach these families compensating them because they are not getting their school meals This can be done by delivering the children is meals at home or instead by providing instant cash to the families said Sandstrom Another key role for the WFP is to provide logistics to UN humanitarian staff and other organizations on the ground ensuring they have access to hospitals and protective items to shield them from contagion risks We have hubs that make sure that these type of items can be shipped to where they are needed she said economy

themselves in a crunch Plunging oil prices and the deepening fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is a double blow to Gulf governments as they seek to protect their energydependent economies In 2014 the last time the price of oil saw a drastic collapse Gulf countries comprising Saudi Arabia Kuwait Qatar Bahrain Oman and the UAE slashed subsidies introduced new taxes and undertook policies to diversify their oildependent economies With much of the global economy now in tatters and most economies pumping in money to stimulate economic activity Gulf countries have little room to engage in painful reforms The largesse that Gulf citizens have become accustomed to may see a curtailment which could result in political instability for the absolute monarchies A Bloomberg financial analyst has warned that an economic recovery amongst the six Gulf countries could look L shaped for years to come amidst an oncoming global economic slowdown Saudi Arabia As the largest economy in the Gulf and the world is biggest producer of oil Saudi Arabia has seen its finances stretched in recent years as the countrys young and inexperienced Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salaman MBS has taken over the reins of power The Saudi war on Yemen launched in 2015 has seen the country bogged down in an unwinnable war even as the humanitarian crisis in the country goes from bad to worse A recent unilateral ceasefire by the Saudi government in its war against the Houthis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic may ultimately incentivise Riyadh to enter into negotiations and end its costly war The Saudi economy in recent years has also been battered by a cold conflict with Iran which briefly turned hot when 50 percent of the countrys oil supply was knocked out by drone strikes with some pointing the finger at Iran A blockade against Qatar the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Kashoggi internal crackdowns on the Saudi elite and civil society has frightened foreign investors and tarnished the countrys image The UNs World Investment Report for 2019 noted that while Foreign Direct Investment to Saudi Arabia rose from 14 billion in 2017 to 32 billion in 2018 it is still significantly lower than the 2008 peak of 39 billion Political factors and lower oil prices were largely responsible for lower than usual FDI flows to Saudi Arabia the report said In 2019 the MBS government announced the largest budget in Saudi history at 295 billion in a bid to push through reforms and investment programmes That was largely based on assumptions about the price of oil that no longer hold MBSs Vision 2030 plan which aimed to modernise the country is economy has also been derided as a white elephant and now as the world and Saudi Arabia grapple with the coronavirus it looks set to be a mirage A recent announcement to triple the valueadded tax VAT from five to 15 percent are initial instalments in what may eventually amount to painful austerity measures for the country Initially introduced two years ago in a bid to reduce reliance on oil revenues the VAT may now also hurt consumer spending The country is tourism and religious pilgrimage industry will also likely suffer this year Hajj and Umrah religious rituals undertaken by Muslims bring in more than 12 billion to the kingdom every year contributing 20 percent to the nonoil GDP of the country and around 7 percent of the total GDP An International Monetary Fund IMF report in 2019 painted a stark picture of the financial deterioration facing the Kingdom It said that the net financial assets of the Kingdom had declined to just 01 percent of gross domestic product from 50 percent over the previous four years through 2018 The Kingdom it noted will likely be a net debtor for the foreseeable future even if oil prices rise to over 80 per barrel Over the same four years the net financial assets held by the six Gulf monarchies saw a fall of 500 billion according to a study by the IMF earlier this year United Arab Emirates Although the UAE is the most diversified economy in the Gulf with the nonoil sector accounting for more than 71 percent of GDP it is still heavily exposed to fluctuations in the oil market Dubai is particularly vulnerable and faces a repeat of the 2009 crash which saw the neighbouring Emirate of Abu Dhabi step in to bail it out a UK based consultancy firm Capital Economics wrote in a report last month Efforts to contain the coronavirus will cause Dubais economy to contract sharply said the authors of the report adding that debts have risen to more than 80 of the Emirates GDP We think that Abu Dhabi would ultimately step in with another bailout But a risk of a repeat of the events of 2009 when support was slow to arrive is high That would make the financial market and economic fallout much worse they concluded Dubai faces a triple threat of a decline in tourism a continued lockdown aimed at tackling the spread of the virus low oil prices an oversupply in the country is real estate market and the risk of foreign residents abandoning the city The UAEs flagship airline Emirates has said that the international airline industry is unlikely to recover for the next 18 months with the airliner likely to need extended state support According to the rating agency Moodys in the UAE the negative growth and fiscal implications are most acute in Dubai while it faces the greater risk of its governmentrelated entities requiring financial support as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions Qatar Unlike Japan which saw the summer Olympics cancelled Qatar which is hosting the 2022 World Cup may still have the chance to conduct the games as normal depending on how the pandemic evolves More immediately the country has seen an explosion of coronavirus cases with more than 1000 reported infections per day for the last five days Authorities there have attributed the spike in case to greater testing capabilities With malls closed and much of life coming to a standstill the stateowned national airline Qatar Airways has announced significant staff layoff as air travel comes to a standstill In an early belttightening measure the Qatari government in April postponed more than 8 billion in unawared contracts The gas and oilrich country have seen demand in Liquified Natural Gas from its main customers in Asia and Europe drop significantly as both regions grapple with the coronavirus outbreak Kuwait Almost a month in and the Kuwaiti government has shown no sign that it will relax curfew measures that have seen people confined to their homes for more than 16 hours a day The government has announced a series of measures to ease the financial burden on the oilrich country reeling from the collapse in the price of energy The sectors most impacted include aviation hospitality and the real estate sector as people stay indoors unable to travel and put on hold spending However in part because the government has been running budget deficits for several years it only has around 45 billion in reserves Declining reserves and a fall in revenues has placed the country on a negative financial outlook the rating agency Fitch warned Bahrain and Oman Ratings agencies have warned that the minnows of the Gulf economies Bahrain and Oman will need support from the rest of the GCC to help them withstand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic Budget deficits for this year are expected to be in the double digits for most of the Gulf countries at between 1525 percent of GDP Only Qatar is expected to post an 8 percent of GDP budget deficit Bahrain and Oman both announced 30 percent of GDP economic stimulus packages and they will both face a recession in the nonoil economy Alongside the economic stimulus package Bahrain has announced 30 percent spending cuts with Oman following suit with a 10 percent cut After the 2014 oil price crash Gulf countries introduced indirect taxes for the first time marking a first time attempt at fiscal consolidation The current pandemic may well see financially strapped countries slashing generous welfare provisions and maybe even direct taxes the cost of doing this may go beyond the economic balance sheet and may even have political implications

coronavirus The black community in the US is turning out to be most vulnerable to the ongoing pandemic Although data on race and the coronavirus is too limited the racial breakdown of viruslinked deaths in cities like Chicago and North Carolina suggests that the black community is worst hit As of April 8 the total number of coronavirus cases in the US is 435000 and the virus has claimed almost 15000 deaths so far In Chicago alone out of 177 casualties 122 are black Americans Chicago the third largest city in the US has a black population that makes up 30 percent of its total three million people The rising death toll of black people in the city caused by Covid19 cases once again reveals the dark side of American society the longstanding racial inequality that robs the disadvantaged people from black communities of health services as they are poor and cannot afford insurance As in other cities with high percentages of African American populations including Detroit Mississippi Alabama New Orleans Georgia and New York similar stories are playing out TRT World spoke to Donna NeilDemir health advisor at Zakat Foundation of America and staff nurse at Little Co Marry for some insights Demir an African American based in Chicago is involved in humanitarian work to give back to her community She has been distributing gloves and masks to hospitals all over Chicago since the outbreak When asked about why the coronavirus is disproportionately infecting and killing African Americans Demir says the black community cant afford housing so they live very tightly together sometimes multiple generations living in one house where social distancing is unlikely and the virus is spreading quickly Secondly she says the jobs they work mostly in service and maintenance requires them to keep going to work amidst the lockdown which makes black communities more vulnerable to contracting coronavirus These people are struggling to survive everyday I have a friend who told me I cant afford to not go to work If I get it I get it They cannot stay at home Its not a choice Even before Covid19 they are not allowed to be sick They go to work in pain while having fever they do not have the luxury to call in sick because of the poverty and the fear of losing their jobs and not being able to find another one Its a mass system of poverty According to 2018 US Census Data the highest poverty rate by race is found among Native Americans 254 percent with the second highest poverty rate 208 percent among the black community Considering the fact that 65 percent of all black families with children are being headed by single women Demir warned about the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis and upcoming problems A lot of single family homes where the mother or grandmother is raising the children are at risk If the mother or the grandmother dies these children will become orphans In better scenarios if the father brother or grandfather of the house sole breadwinner of the family dies how is the wife the mother with no skills going to feed herself and the children she asked Demir says health disparities also play a key factor Genetically African Americans tend to be diabetic asthmatic and suffer from high blood pressure comorbidity leading to low life expectancy as black Americans dont have access to healthcare and there is mistrust to the system given the racist history of American medicine The US has a shortage of testing kits and Demir says the test kits are not being dispensed equally Were obviously at a higher risk from coronavirus infections How does that work You contract the virus youre sick you dont know you have it We dont have test kits We cant afford to stay at home You keep going to work So you are travelling back and forth and it will keep spreading among the black community much faster Demir says the inequality has not just started with Covid19 Our circumstances and the way we live has never been equal to the way the rest of America lives not just us also other minorities but you see it more with black communities Because we were never able to get through lots of issues from being slaves Some of us got education and living nicely but statistically its still not working out Unemployment is high violence is high drug sales and usage is high all these are directly related to the poverty Demir says it is very hard for people to see America in this light whis is so different from the lifestyle shown in American movies but a lot of Americans live very much below the poverty line In the average American public schools in the black neighbourhoods we still have meal programs going on because kids go to school hungry The USDA estimated that 111 percent of US households were food insecure in 2018 meaning to say that approximately 143 million households had difficulty providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources Demir further explains the health disparities in the American society When you look at the infant mortality rate in Michigan it is very similar to that of people in Africa Babies die at a rate almost similar to a third world country Now why are we so badly infected by this virus Because we dont have access to healthcare We cant afford healthcare According to 2018 national maternal mortality rates of the 658 women who died of maternal causes black women fared the worst dying 25 times more often than white women 371 vs 147 deaths per 100000 live births Demir says they lack grocery stores in their communities let alone clinics It is called food deserts here areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food found predominantly in lowincome areas We dont have grocery stores You only find stores that sell alcohol and maybe they will sell a lit bit of food on the side I dont know where to start Demir says education and understanding is an issue among their community in their fight against the coronavirus In order to address this gap Demir also volunteers for the National Black Muslim Covid Coalition which was launched to help the community contain the disease on March 23 with the joint efforts of 40 individuals from different disciplines around the country These people dont know any better Its not something they do on purpose How does the right information get to them Demir said We live such separate lives in Chicago that no one comes into our community to help It will take a lot of prioritizing to fix the black communities problems We need to keep people in their homes to stop the spread of the coronavirus But then you also need to reach them to get them food In short we have to be able to deliver food to people that are shut down in their homes this will help the community stop the disease The history of African Americans in Chicago dates back to the 18th Century The early fugitive slaves and freedmen established communities becoming an urban population Speaking of her story in Chicago Demir says they live so separate lives in the same city Between this side and that the streets go bad there are holes in the streets the lights dont work there are no grocery stores Its almost like you see an invisible line When you go to certain neighbourhoods in Chicago you can tell which one is black which one is white Things have never been equitable for us Its institutionalised poverty most of Chicagos black communities have no stores at all no bookstores maybe a library Schools have no art classes nor music classes Most have no computer nothing to help them or make them competitive in the

way of their goodwill Although Turkey like the rest of the world is facing its own problems with the coronavirus pandemic that has not stopped it from mustering the effort to send vital medical aid to dozens of countries around the world Some of the most hardhit countries including Italy and Spain have been recipients of Turkish aid as have countries ranging from the economically advanced like the United States and the United Kingdom to developing countries such as Iran and Somalia However while Turkeys relief efforts have been global in outlook it is ironically European powers who have been the primary beneficiaries of Turkish magnanimity despite decades of hostility towards Ankara Decades of poor treatment It is of little surprise that Turkey has been able to marshal its resources and impose effective measures in containing the coronavirus For a start Turkey has been host to millions of refugees from Syria alone for the better part of a decade and has managed to handle a crisis that would have brought many other economies including in the West to their knees Turkey also has a longstanding history of disaster management with cities such as Istanbul in the West and Van in the east suffering repeated earthquakes that have shattered homes and lives repeatedly From an industrial point of view Turkey also has a thriving technology and manufacturing sector with Turkish defence and major appliances giants teaming up to produce the countrys first domestically manufactured ventilators Around 250 of these ventilators have now been completed with the industrial conglomerate promising 5000 units by the end of May at the cost of 6500 per unit as opposed to almost 20000 per unit for imported devices With such a solid humanitarian and industrial foundation from which it can effectively combat the deadly disease it is unsurprising that Turkey can take the initiative in providing aid abroad It may be surprising that Turkey is so willing to do this at all considering how much negativity and hostility had been directed its way from many of those powers it is now so openhanded with It is no secret that Turkey has long harboured ambitions to join the European Union having made an application to accede to the EUs predecessor the European Economic Community in 1987 Since then Turkey has faced hurdle after hurdle despite bending over backwards to facilitate the demands placed on it by EU leaders Nevertheless and even though it has an established secularist tradition with close to a century of westernisation efforts Muslim Turkeys accession has always been resisted by Christian Europe The racism and discrimination do not end there During the seemingly neverending Brexit debate one of the key advocates for the UKs exit from the EU Boris Johnson began actively fearmongering that 80 million Turks would be on their way to migrate to Britain if Brexit did not happen He also ramped up fears of a mass refugee influx to Britain by claiming Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had his hand on the tap and could send Syrians and other refugees to the UK That man is now the prime minister and was himself stricken by the coronavirus where his countrys National Health Service has been feeling significant strain and is currently being sent several relief packages from Turkey Even in terms of Turkeys vital interests Ankara has repeatedly been snubbed by its friends and allies in favour of Marxist terrorist organisations Western powers led by the United States made no secret of the fact they were supplying arms to the YPG a group so intimately tied to the PKK terrorist organisation that it is impossible to know where one begins and the other ends While the PKK is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and most of its NATO allies the YPG was conveniently compartmentalised away from the PKK in the eyes of Western lawmakers so they could use YPG terrorists against Daesh terrorists in Syria This was no honest mistake as nowretired US General Raymond Thomas himself admitted the YPG was simply a rebrand of the PKK Moving forward postcoronavirus Much of the antiTurkish hostility outlined above is very recent and showed a complete disregard for Turkeys legitimate interests in terms of security for its borders and citizens Turkey has consistently been mistreated by those it is now sending significant quantities of aid to Sadly and considering the pragmatic and cynical way global politics often works it is unlikely that this hostility towards Turkey will change Although Ankara has once again demonstrated that it is both good and beneficial to have Turkey as a friend and ally the track record of these countries and their political leadership shows that Turkey should not believe their humanitarian efforts to fight off the most significant global public health crisis faced in living memory will bank them any goodwill It is entirely fair to say that Turkey has often been unable to advance its point of view to an international audience Turkey is now developing its soft power but when compared to small but resourcerich nations like Qatar who wields the media giant Al Jazeera Network and an array of smaller boutique outlets as an effective lever of power Ankara is still in the process of developing and advancing this capability With the impending global economic crisis that may exceed the Great Depression in its damage Turkey could do worse than to invest in maximising its media and lobbying potential to better channel its perspective into influential capitals around the world It would be enormously beneficial for Turkey to enhance its image as a friend to populations around the world and not only their political leadership as it could then find itself enjoying the support of the public in pressuring their governments to treat Turkey as it deserves as a friend to cherish and support not an adversary to be undermined and attacked at every turn We welcome all pitches and

balance On Tuesday a massive blast tore through Beirut when 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded causing destruction that even wartime correspondents have seldom seen A largescale industrial accident in the face of a failing economy equates to nothing short of a humanitarian tragedy and a sign of how fragile some states have become during the pandemic By comparison the ammonium nitratefilled 1996 IRA bomb which flattened Manchester city centre contained 15 tonnes of explosive making this nearly 2000 times as powerful In the Covid19 age many countries infrastructures are already close to breaking point This means that any new superimposed stress or crisis can push struggling states into failed states a catastrophic fate that I hope will be avoided in Lebanon Humanitarian staff were already worried that the pandemic has stretched the countrys healthcare infrastructure beyond its capacity with thousands now injured over a 100 killed and billions of dollars of damage the capital now faces an unprecedented challenge Although there is still some speculation about what exactly happened on Tuesday and what led to such a large amount of explosive material being stored so close to residential areas for six years one thing is for certain this is a humanitarian disaster the fallout of which will have far reaching consequences for not just the millions of Lebanese citizens but the region as well Lebanon is home to over 15 million refugees This crisis will hit them and the most vulnerable first Hospitals are overburdened and the planned coronavirus lockdown has been called off in the aftermath of the deadly explosion This is against the backdrop of an economy that was already in tatters with hyperinflation and skyrocketing unemployment For Lebanon this is crisis upon crisis a shattered economy and a crumbling health system due to waves of disasters political strife regional instability a global pandemic and now one more crisis that may just push the country over the edge This phenomenon isnt just a Lebanese problem it is a tragic part of the new normal I have seen through the charity I run Penny Appeal the impact the pandemic has had on other troubled parts of the world like Yemen Gaza Syria and Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh Societies and public services that were already hanging by a thread are in danger of falling into the abyss because of acute emergencies on top of the ongoing ones In Lebanon the economy already had one of the highest debt ratios in the world As the currency crashed imports including the vast majority of the small countrys food supply became exponentially more expensive Many foods became unaffordable to most as well as other essentials like fuel Power cuts became an almost daily occurrence meaning that essential services including those provided by humanitarian workers became unreliable Our partners there have often struggled to continue their operations because of these conditions more often seen in war zones Lebanon is now facing two acute health emergencies firstly Tuesdays fatal disaster and secondly the worsening pandemic threat as social distancing becomes impossible during a disaster response An estimated 300000 have been made homeless in a city of 24 million with the loss of livelihoods due to the explosion promising to worsen the economic emergency Then there is the shadow of this tragedy being politicised and worsening Lebanons religious and political divisions leading to worse governance and potentially even conflict This is why the aid response must be comprehensive swift and above all apolitical There have already been offers of aid to Lebanon from Israel Iran and Saudi Arabia in short all the regional powers that have played a hand in the small countrys political divisions and paralysis past and present Just as the aid response is being politicised so too is blame for the explosion with conspiracy theories blaming all of those countries aforementioned with scant regard for the evidence or lack of it Humanitarian work must be built on humanity not political or religious affiliations Just like our staff in the UK that reflect the diverse communities of Britain our partners in Lebanon hail from a range of Lebanons eighteen religious groups Humanitarian assistance that comes with strings attached inevitably cripples the beneficiaries in the long term increasing societal divisions rather than healing them As well as a truly nonpoliticised international effort to get the country back on its feet Lebanon needs sustained investment in its infrastructure and public services Not too dissimilar to many developed countries including Britain Pandemics deadly explosions and unprecedented disasters often open our eyes to the cracks or indeed gaping holes in what we assumed were otherwise resilient services The pandemic has shown us whether in Beirut or Birmingham that we need to be everprepared for the worst and invest in services that protect us all when disaster strikes We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion please send them via email to opinioneditorialtrtworldcom

advice she might be the last person I call She might return my call after I have given my last breath Patients come first even when off duty Thats the type of dedication you can see in the overwhelming majority of doctors in Turkey Being a medical student is like getting commando training in the army Internship means sleepless days in hospitals Coming home I am faced with a dilemma I can either take a shower and fall asleep or eat and fall asleep I dont have any energy left to do both and go to sleep an intern physician once told me Numbers are important but there is a human factor behind every success story Turkeys relatively good handling of the novel coronavirus crisis has been attributed to its health system among others I am among those who have explained the Justice and Development Partys AK Party success in elections until the mid2000s with the tangible changes it made in the lives of lowerincome families rather than its members attending Friday prayers Health care was a priority for the AK Party The country saw significant increases in health expenditures until 2008 While Turkey currently has 281 beds for 1000 people putting it far behind countries like Germany or France it is one of the top countries in Europe in the number of Intensive Care Unit ICU beds per capita something that mattered in the fight against COVID19 In an excellent article Evren Balta and Soli Özel explained why a country with a relatively young population has this many ICU beds The answer lies in the privatization of the health sector Almost 60 percent of the intensive care beds are in private hospitals Intensive care services are the most expensive medical service the costs of which services are covered by the state insurance system if the patient cannot afford their treatment Previously there were a multitude of reports on how private hospitals were abusing the system by unnecessarily and extensively putting patients in ICUs and charging the public for that wrote Balta and Özel But what was a source of criticism turned out to be an advantage just as it has been with the use of computerized tomography CT There has been criticism in the past for the overuse of CT as it entails radiation risks But this turned into an advantage in solving the diagnosis problem since the accuracy rates of the tests stands at around 60 percent said Professor Önder Ergönül of Koç University Doctors started treatment for COVID19 by looking at CT results which played a role in the lower fatality rates Yet this is also precisely at the heart of the controversy over the death toll Only the deceased who tested positive are registered as having died from COVID19 A patient who received COVID19 treatment but died without being tested is registered as a death due to an outbreak or pneumonia Critics claim the number of deaths due to the pandemic to be three times as high But if the fatality rate was twice as high for instance even that would mean that Turkey has handled the crisis well especially compared to developed Western countries according to Ergönül Turkey should be proud I think authorities need to feel selfconfident and be more transparent there is no need to hide anything said Ergönül The numbers for each city for instance were made available to the public only on May 27 and only partially Once doubt creeps in due to a lack of transparency subsequent statements wont suffice to promote the wellmerited success story When seeing the underperformance of some of the worlds most advanced democracies people have difficulty understanding the relative success of developing countries especially those where democratic standards have seen setbacks But where does the credit go First of all there are multiple factors that contributed to the relative success including the young population as in the case of Turkey No doubt the Turkish government should also get credit for having invested in the health sector which was not overwhelmed by COVID19 patients But lets not forget the human factor Turkey has skilled health care workers In addition to their scientific abilities Turkish physicians are used to heavy workloads Treatment protocols are not prepared by politicians but by physicians who are the students of previous generations of the health army of the Republic The Health Ministrys decision to impose an additional barrier to scientific research on COVID19 will do tremendous injustice to the physicians currently working in the field as well as to the memory of those who passed away After all the success story of Turkish physicians needs to be told to the world Those willing to do research and publish their findings have to get the consent of the ministry This will only hamper efforts to promote Turkeys success as it contradicts its humanitarian foreign policy Other countries should not be deprived of knowing Turkey is best practices

COVID19 were reported in Iran is Qom city I got a call from a friend in that city He was planning his maiden trip to India during the New Year holiday and asked for my advices to finalize his itinerary How is the situation in Qom I heard about some virus outbreak there I asked him He appeared dismissive saying it was a common influenza and there was no reason to press the panic button Qom a popular religious tourism destination some 100 miles south of the capital Tehran is where the virus emerged in Iran on Feb 19 The city reported the first positive cases and two deaths related to COVID19 before the epicenter of the disease shifted to Tehran My friend is nonchalant remark about what was to snowball into a devastating health crisis was not without a reason In the initial days of its outbreak in Iran the mood in the country was upbeat The statements issued by the government officials seemed to suggest that things were under control The positive approach always helps but the defensive approach is not always right In such crisis situations it helps to adopt a tough offensive aggressive approach just like in a war The COVID19 outbreak in Iran coincided with the muchanticipated parliamentary elections If authorities had sounded alarm bells on time perhaps the voter turnout could have been affected some would argue The elections went on smoothly and it was a clean sweep for the conservatives It would be exaggeration to blame elections for the spread of the disease but the authorities could have focused more on the imminent health crisis After the elections as numbers quite frighteningly started to pile up Iran is Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi appeared before cameras for a briefing flanked by a government spokesperson He had an important message for the people do not panic corona will be defeated The next day he tested positive and subsequently shifted to quarantine He has recovered since and is back at work The authorities were clearly taken aback by the extent and severity of the crisis that engulfed different parts of the country within days The worldwide fatality rate from coronavirus being less than 2 it was shocking for many pundits to note the fatality rate in Iran well above 4 in the beginning which later markedly dropped down as the new infected cases surged Coronavirus emerges as real threat for Iran From single digit figure to double digit and eventually triple digit the alarming surge in infections was clearly felt when dozens of Iranian lawmakers tested positive a sign that the crisis was real and everyone was equally vulnerable Among the political bigwigs who tested positive included Iran is Vice President for Women and Family Affairs Masoumeh Ebtekar and former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati Both have recovered now however three other officials succumbed to the disease A newly elected lawmaker from Tehran a former diplomat from Qom along with a senior advisor to the foreign minister from Tehran Hospitals were flooded by patients those who were positive and were suspected to be positive Many doctors and nurses died in the line of duty hailed as martyrs It seemed the country is healthcare system would be overwhelmed by the massive crisis How the pandemic reached and spread in Iran is still shrouded in mystery It originated in China where thousands of cases were reported in January and February There are reports that the flights between Tehran and Beijing continued unchecked even at the peak of crisis in China However reports also suggested that the first two cases of COVID19 in Qom had no travel history We may never know the roots of its origin in Iran The late response by the authorities in Iran was further complicated by their reluctance to enforce strict lockdown in major cities hit by the virus Hence people failed to come to terms with the gravity of the situation even as the highly contagious virus silently made inroads into their homes bodies and lives A week before the Iranian New Year starting on March 21 when people normally went on a shopping spree and traveled to different cities Iran is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a decree ordering the armed forces to swing into action and enforce lockdown in Tehran and other cities It was believed that only the armed forces could handle the crisis and prevent public gatherings since health experts around the world urged social distancing as a measure to prevent its outbreak Gen Mohammad Bagheri chief of staff for armed forces soon issued orders to empty streets roads and stores within 24 hours Before the order could be executed the civilian authorities opposed it President Hassan Rouhani made it emphatically clear that no lockdown will be enforced before during or after the New Year Tehran is mayor Pirouz Hanachi also rejected the idea of quarantining the capital city saying the government cannot provide financial means to people or compensate businesses due to economic pressure by the US sanctions Advisories fail to contain virus spread In China they managed to significantly contain the outbreak owing to strict measures In Italy as the fatalities surged authorities announced a crackdown on outings In South Korea the government response was timely and people adhered to health advisories In India as soon as initial cases were reported many cities were put under the lockdown Prevention is better than cure and regret In days leading up to the Iranian New Year tens of thousands reportedly traveled to different parts of the country some to their hometowns some others to spend holidays in idyllic hill resorts Despite the health advisories to stay home and cancel travel plans many people went ahead with their plans On the eve of the New Year some markets in Tehran were packed with shoppers It shows why law enforcement is not always possible through mere advisories but requires government action Some days ago as the daily COVID19 figures touched a new high in Iran government announced complete ban on intercity travel something they could have done before the New Year holiday However there were reports that the TehranQom highway was again opened for traffic a day after the announcement which shows the inability to enforce lockdown The opinion is clearly divided in Iran today There is a segment of people that supports the government decision not to impose total lockdown and there is a segment that believes the lockdown should have been imposed weeks before Iran is judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi a strong conservative political figure is among those who believe the lockdown should have been enforced before the New Year holidays The noholdsbarred fight against the pandemic meanwhile is going on in hospitals across the country with the brave army of doctors and nurses serving on the frontline Even with lack of resources and at great personal risk they have been doing an exemplary job in saving precious lives The US economic sanctions on Iran have unarguably made this fight a difficult one and perhaps longer too The shortage of medicine and equipment to treat COVID19 patients is severely impeding the efforts to overcome this simmering crisis It is also one of the reasons that authorities are unwilling to enforce total lockdown Both President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif have emphasized it repeatedly over the past few weeks writing letters to world leaders to use their good offices in prompting the Trump administration to ease sanctions Even US President Donald Trump is predecessors George Bush and Barack Obama had eased sanctions on Iran during their tenures when Iran was hit by earthquake While it is important for the US government to understand that they are complicit in this evolving humanitarian crisis in Iran through the illegal embargo to quote one Iranian academic by weaponizing the COVID19 it is also necessary that the Iranian government looks at ways to defeat the virus despite the US sanctions by imposing strict lockdown and taking tough social distancing measures How COVID19 turned into major health crisis in Iran

even basic foodstuffs unavailable Baghdad is full of food right now but people cannot buy it One construction worker we support has a family of eight and suddenly has no income Another man had sold his cooking gas canister to buy food A third sold his phone he said In a society that deeply values abundance and generosity particularly at the dinner table some are too proud to admit they need help One woman walked halfway across the city to ask for help at another mosque so no one from her own neighbourhood would recognise her Issa said One government official told AFP that almost half the population could be foodpoor by May adding that authorities were studying options for subsidies The country imports most of its staples including rice meat and wheat Officials say Iraq is 60 billion

millions in the poorest countries have become more vulnerable to the economic downturn and food insecurity UN experts warn The World Food Program WFP said the economic outlook and risks of food insecurity continues to darken because of effects of the coronavirus pandemic posing further threats to regions in Africa that are already battling extreme poverty An estimated 265 million people could go hungry in 2020 nearly doubling 2019 figures according to latest WFP is forecasts Experts explain the way the global economic downturn is effecting lowincome economies is that it is becoming increasingly visible and acts through different channels Countries depending heavily on tourism remittances food imports or primary commodities exports are going to face a dire situation Susanna Sandstrom head of the WFP Economics and Markets Unit told Anadolu Agency She noted most vulnerable countries are those hit by not just one but several damaging factors at the same time and will not be able to protect themselves Key economic effects The first factor hurting vulnerable economies is the price of primary commodities which have plunged as the price of crude oil fell to record lows cutting export earnings vital for large parts of the developing world The second is tourism which contributes significantly to foreign exchange earnings in many fragile countries The UN World Tourism Organization expects international tourist arrivals to decline by as much as 30 percent in 2020 hitting countries in developing areas that base their economies on the flux of foreign tourists Remittances the third key channel through which the economic downturn reverberates on poor countries are responsible for up to 30 of gross domestic product in lowincome economies and are expected to fall dramatically as they did during the 2008 economic crisis Economists expect the flow of foreign direct investments to shrink by up to 40 in 2020 The other key factor impacting the poorest countries is the dependence on food imports which leaves those relying on imports exposed to the economic downturn and increased food insecurity That puts upward pressure on domestic prices at a time when households purchasing power is tumbling due to the large percentage of income lost amid the crisis The COVID19 pandemic and forced lockdowns that followed is taking a heavy toll globally in terms of unemployment The International Labor Organization ILO estimates a reduction in working hours in the second quarter of 2020 that is equivalent to 195 million fulltime workers Those people who were already living below the international poverty line now are also losing their jobs Those are the ones who risk the highest damage said Sandstrom She stressed economic insecurity due to the stopping of remittances and job loss translates into food insecurity which is also aggravated by increasing food prices The areas at highest risk are mostly countries in Africa that were already facing economic problems and food insecurity said Sandstrom citing South Sudan Nigeria Angola and the Middle East She noted the struggling population of refugees living in camps is particularly exposed to sanitary and the economic effects of the pandemic which are often combined with other distressing factors This is happening for instance in Bangladesh where the pandemic crisis has coupled with the monsoon season she said WFP role To help vulnerable populations cope with the pandemic and its economic fallout the WFP is focusing on maintaining effective operations despite the sanitary emergency We are sustaining our operations around the world making sure that the distribution of food or cash transfers can be made respecting security and sanitary conditions said Sandstrom The WFP is cooperating with local governments to help build safety nets able to shield people who are losing jobs and becoming exposed to extreme poverty Sandstrom noted the COVID19 crisis is often has a heavier effect on urban areas due to the income effect People in the countryside can still provide food to themselves by farming she said While people in the urban areas are more dependent on market food Another critical issue for WFP is the closure of schools in poor countries where many families receive food aid through the school meal programs We had to find other ways to reach these families compensating them because they are not getting their school meals This can be done by delivering the children is meals at home or instead by providing instant cash to the families said Sandstrom Another key role for the WFP is to provide logistics to UN humanitarian staff and other organizations on the ground ensuring they have access to hospitals and protective items to shield them from contagion risks We have hubs that make sure that these type of items can be shipped to where they are needed she said Pandemic to hit poorest economies harder WFP

those who need attention the most Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF says unprecedented fear of the virus is preventing people in Yemens capital Sanaa from seeking medical care The organisation recently began supporting a new Covid19 treatment centre in Sheikh Zayed hospital in the Yemeni capital Like a number of other hospitals in the country Sheikh Zayed was designated by health authorities as a Covid19 treatment centre and shifted from providing maternity services and trauma care to tackling a pandemic that has challenged some of the worlds most developed health systems According to MSF staff an overwhelming number of people in Yemen perceive hospitals as the source of infection and only half of the 20 beds for patients with moderate coronavirus symptoms in Sheikh Zayed hospital are currently occupied Another reason is that some people are also spreading rumours about what happens in hospitals to patients who suffer from symptoms of Covid19 Dr Abdulrahman an MSF doctor who works in the intensive care unit ICU explains that because of the shortage of medical staff at the moment a real problem both in this hospital and countrywide he has also started working and supporting colleagues in the inpatient department As a doctor working in a Covid19 treatment centre certainly Im concerned about possible infection especially with all the news about health workers contracting the virus But Im a doctor its impossible for me to stay home Its my duty to come to this hospital every day and provide a meaningful service to people while I can he said According to Dr Abdulrahman they have noticed an increased number of patients with moderate symptoms arriving at the hospital In our ICU we see patients arriving very late and needing to be put on oxygen straight away We see patients over the age of 60 and others with diseases such as diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and heart problems They require greater attention and constant observation On the other hand some in Yemen are fearful of being stigmatised by their communities should they test positive for the disease As a result many Yemenis are not seeking medical care until their condition becomes serious We are seeing at first hand the detrimental impact of misinformation that is being circulated all over the country augmenting fear of the virus in society says Dr Abdulrahman A system on the brink Many patients arriving at Sheikh Zayed hospitals emergency room are in a critical condition and need immediate support with their breathing All six beds are occupied in the intensive care unit where patients in severe respiratory distress receive roundtheclock care this attention is entirely dependent on oxygen cylinders that require changing every three hours We are concerned over what we see in the hospital but an even greater concern is the patients we dont see those who choose not to seek medical treatment until their condition deteriorates considerably says Caroline Ducarme MSFs Head of Mission in Yemen Yemen has very limited testing capabilities for Covid19 and so the virus is spreading across the country in an untraced fashion After years of war the health system was already under considerable strain before the pandemic Now it appears that people have lost trust in the health system and health staff Recent reports emerged that health workers are at high risk of falling ill with the virus this has raised serious concerns about their safety among medical staff across the country leading many to quit their jobs and stay at home ultimately leaving hospitals shortstaffed One of the consistent challenges we face is finding skilled medical staff willing to work in a Covid19 treatment centre where they are needed most says MSFs Ducarme This is despite the use of personal protective equipment and the strict implementation of infection prevention and control measures in this hospital The departure of health workers is further weakening the Yemeni health system Sheikh Zayed hospital is the second Covid19 treatment facility in Sanaa supported by MSF along with AlKuwait hospital Some of MSFs patients have travelled long distances to get treatment in the capital suggesting that there are many unmet medical needs elsewhere A number of our patients in Sheikh Zayed hospital come from governorates as far as Taiz and Ad Dhale in search of essential medical care that may be inaccessible in their areas explains Roger Gutiérrez MSFs Head of Emergencies in Yemen The patients we see have the means to travel but what about those who are seriously ill with no means to travel and no other medical options around MSF says that more resources are desperately needed in Yemen both for Covid19 patients and for those with other health needs It is calling on the international community to mobilise resources to help Yemen cope with this crisis and calling on Yemeni authorities to facilitate the implementation of lifesaving programmes A massive scaleup of the overall health response is required to urgently address the silent needs says Ducarme Instead of cutting down support at such a critical time the international community should be mobilising maximum resources to maintain humanitarian interventions in Yemen while local authorities must exert all efforts to facilitate the implementation of lifesaving programmes and ensure that people can safely access humanitarian aid

widelymismanaged economies of the MENA where medical systems are underresourced and muchneeded infrastructure either destroyed or lacking The spread of COVID19 undoubtedly has had a catastrophic impact on the most vulnerable communities of the world According to a recent World Bank report the Middle East and North Africa MENA region is ranked as secondlowest among all regions in the overall Global Health Security Index and it comes last in terms of both epidemiology workforce and emergency preparedness and response planning Without an effective and coordinated set of policies to achieve a swift economic recovery the region is highly likely to suffer from greater political instabilities and become a breeding ground for terror groups The COVID19 outbreak has exacerbated these preexisting vulnerabilities and risks in the widelymismanaged economies of the MENA where medical systems are underresourced and muchneeded infrastructure either destroyed or lacking A range of harsh antiCOVID19 measures such as selfisolation social distancing and lockdowns including total curfews and international travel restrictions have been implemented by governments to control the spread of the virus and protect lives These preventive measures however led economies across the region to experience severe supply and demand shocks The most recent regional economic outlook reports published by both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF forecast that regional economies would most likely experience a sharp economic fallout by 42 percent and 47 percent in 2020 respectively Still the real sociopolitical and economic impact of the COVID19 pandemic in the MENA remains highly uncertain and will strictly depend on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy responses developed by each nation The current predictions however suggest that all critical macroeconomic indicators such as fiscal and current account balances foreign reserves and the inflow of foreign direct investment will be distressed as a result of the crisis The pandemicinduced crisis is expected to exacerbate poverty deepen inequality and constrain households access to basic needs including health services The economic repercussions of the COVID19 pandemic effectively forced almost all countries in the region to request financial assistance from the IMF or other financial institutions to strengthen their economic position and prevent the possibility of a prolonged economic recession As a result regional economies have become heavily dependent on the reform directions of the IMF World Bank and other investment banks Socioeconomic and political tensions remain a distinct possibility in the postpandemic era if policy responses fail to meet the demands of the majority and set a path for swift economic recovery Countries such as Lebanon Jordan Palestine Egypt and Tunisia already have debilitated capabilities Persisting sociopolitical and economic hardship exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic may lead to a vicious cycle of economic malaise The same outcome applies to the only two oilexporting countries of the region Iraq and Algeria Their economies were hit by the complete halt of economic activities due to the pandemic and have also been severely affected by the crash of oil prices A similar assessment is applicable to wartorn countries of the region Syria and Libya too Though their economic outlook is linked to a sustainable political order and strong security environment the spread of the virus and its humanitarian and economic costs are extra burdens on the wellbeing of communities living in these countries The only countries in the region with a relatively positive sociopolitical and financial outlook are Israel and Morocco While their economies are experiencing the economic consequences of the pandemic their macroeconomic variables are in a better position compared to their peers Their public and externals debts are relatively lower in comparison to other nations in the region Nevertheless every country will experience the heavy burden of issues such as collapsing global trade low commodity prices major capital outflows and healthcarespecific challenges inflicted by the COVID19 outbreak The crisis is dealing a heavy blow on sectors such as tourism export companies and small and mediumsized businesses which employ the largest share of the workforce and generate a considerable share of the revenue streams for the regions economic development A reduction in income from these sectors as well as remittances and foreign investment from the oilrich Gulf countries subsequently hampered the foreign reserves and deepened the current account deficit across the region as a whole Against this challenging backdrop a range of economic recovery packages have been announced by the governments to mitigate the economic repercussions of the COVID19 The majority of them are aimed at helping the most hardhit sectors and communities through temporary tax relief cash transfers or cheap financing The uncertainty about the real economic impact of the pandemic however has complicated the policy response Many of these economies have limited fiscal and external debt capacities The Lebanese government for instance has the highest external debt in the region with approximately 170 percent of its GDP Jordan Tunisia Egypt and Iraq follow Lebanon with external debts of 97 90 872 and 80 percent of their GDP respectively Ultimately many of these economies had already been battling with high poverty political instability and poor healthcare infrastructure hence the historic economic downturn provoked by the novel coronavirus will aggravate existing economic and humanitarian challenges The region already has the worlds highest youth unemployment and it hosts countries that have weak security institutions In the period that lies ahead if the geostrategic vulnerabilities and risks continue to amplify across the region without a stable political leadership effective civil service and a welltargeted set of economic recovery programs the region will likely experience a prolonged economic recession and an increased risk of social unrest This article was originally published in Anadolu Agency is analysis section Disclaimer The viewpoints expressed by the authors do not necessarily reflect the

confirmed its first case of the coronavirus Years of violence have left its healthcare system notably vulnerable The World Health Organisation representative in Tripoli has warned of the significant risks faced if Covid19 spreads in a country where ongoing conflict will make combating an outbreak very difficult The United Nations and other countries including the UK the European Union the US Tunisia and Algeria are calling on the warring parties to stop fighting to make it easier to deal with the virus Despite the ceasefire deal Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar and his selfdeclared Libyan National Army LNA continue to fire rockets on various Tripoli neighbourhoods and at least five civilians were killed just a few days back The attacks came just days after Haftar expressed his commitment to a humanitarian pause in fighting against the UNbacked government in Tripoli so authorities could focus on stopping the spread of the virus Instead of halting the offensive on humanitarian grounds after the first Covid19 case was confirmed Haftars forces seem intent on continuing their assault Refugees and migrants are the most vulnerable groups in the event of an outbreak Countries including the United Arab Emirates UAE Egypt and France have long supported Haftar financially and militarily The arrival of Russian mercenaries and air support from the UAE have introduced a new element and exacerbated the conflict since September last year In the face of another offensive on Tripoli the GNA requested Turkey is help and Ankara responded Turkey stepped up its efforts to deploy military advisers and sent armed drones There are only a handful of countries like Turkey which honour their pledges and support the UNbacked government in Libya To counter Turkeys support to GNA Haftar has formalised its alignment with the Syrian regime allowing his militia groups to purchase technical advice from Damascus using material and diplomatic rewards Reportedly Russian private military contractor Wagner has been recruiting Syrians since last January to fight alongside forces loyal to Haftar in Libya A mercenary from southern Syria told the Financial Times that he has been recruited to fight in Libya and was promised 1000 a month to protect facilities rising to 1500 a month for missions Haftars alliance with the Assad regime resulted in Syrias Cham Wings Airliner to open an office in Benghazi Libyas internationally recognised government has accused Cham Wings of exposing the wartorn country to coronavirus by bringing Syrian fighters connected to Wagner as well as elements of Lebanons Hezbollah and Irans Revolutionary Guard into the eastern city of Benghazi to support Haftar Mercenaries from countries like Syria and Iran is a source of concern considering the amount of cases in Iran and the unknown extent of the spread in Syria If their worst fears materialise a health catastrophe is likely to take place in Libya due to the countrys degraded health system UN SecretaryGeneral António Guterres has called on all sides to stop the fighting The virus has incapacitated UN Refugee Agency UNHCR activities in the country This situation may prevent hundreds of vulnerable migrants from accessing humanitarian aid in the country especially those in refugee camps Oil is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy and the countrys primary source of revenue Haftar has been trying to use it as a trump card Forces loyal to Haftar seized large export terminals and choked off major pipelines in January aiming to choke the UNbacked government of significant revenue As a result the Libyan National Oil Corporation NOC has lost over 35 billion since January 17 with daily losses at more than 11 million It warned of a looming fuel shortage given the internationally recognised governments potential failure to pay for imports such as medical supplies which could make it harder to battle coronavirus The peace conference held in Berlin in January 2020 to persuade Libyas warring sides as well as their principal international backers to agree to a ceasefire and respect a UN arms embargo failed In the eyes of many observers the conference represented an abject failure as some countries continue to provide military assistance to Haftar International involvement from the UAE Egypt France and Russia is exacerbating the conflict making the process of national reconciliation elusive Notably the UAE has stepped up its air support to the warlord which enables him to maintain pressure on government forces According to some reports the UAE has made a 3000ton delivery of military equipment to Haftars forces over the last few weeks It is also believed that the number of Emirati personnel in Libya has increased Such support has also emboldened Haftar to reject any and all ceasefire offers let alone a longterm political settlement preferring instead to seize the entire Libyan territory by force What Libya urgently needs now is a permanent ceasefire to prepare itself for Covid19 outbreak otherwise Libyans could face devastating consequences It is essential that the US and the EU heavily pressure the UAE into reducing support for Haftar who is seen by many as the principal obstacle confronting the unity of the country If not nipped in the bud this conflict could expand and escalate beyond its current confines In the meantime the Libyan people will continue to suffer from this ongoing conflict We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion please send them via email to opinioneditorialtrtworldcom

already been forced to stop some of their work even as the coronavirus rips through the country Some 75 percent of UN programmes in Yemen have had to shut their doors or reduce operations The global body is World Food Programme had to cut rations in half and UNfunded health services were reduced in 189 out of 369 hospitals nationwide Its almost impossible to look a family in the face to look them in the eyes and say Im sorry but the food that you need in order to survive we have to cut in half Lise Grande resident UN coordinator for Yemen told The Associated Press The dwindling funds are the result of several factors but among the top reasons is obstruction by Yemens Houthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa and other territories The United States one of the largest donors decreased its aid to Yemen earlier this year citing interference by the Houthis Its yet to be seen whether the Houthis will allow monitoring and oversight or give UN agencies the space to operate A UN pledging conference for Yemen on Tuesday seeks 241 billion to cover essential activities from June to December Grande said the Houthis are working to become more transparent and that she hopes this will encourage donor countries to give aid Her optimism however comes as the Houthis face heavy criticism for suppressing information about the number of Covid19 cases and fatalities in areas they control while putting no mitigation measures in place Conference cohosted for the first time by Saudi Arabia Tuesday is conference will be cohosted for the first time by Saudi Arabia a major player in Yemens civil war since it first unleashed a bombing campaign in 2015 to try to push back the Iranianbacked Houthis who had seized the northern half of the country Critics question the Saudis highprofile role in rallying humanitarian support even as they continue to wage a war as do the Houthis that has created the worlds worst humanitarian crisis Maysaa Shuja al Deen a Yemeni researcher and a nonresident fellow at the Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies said the kingdom is trying to repair its international image by changing the conversation Saudi Arabia has always tried to change the narrative of the war and present itself as a backer of the legitimate government not part of the conflict she said In past years the kingdom has been one of the top donors for UN humanitarian aid operations in Yemen The Saudi ambassador to Yemen Mohammed al Jaber said the kingdom will allocate half a billion dollars this year to support UN programs including 25 million for a Covid19 response plan Rapid coronavirus spread in Yemen The UN itself has also investigated allegations of corruption and diversion of aid in Yemen in its own ranks Reports indicate that the coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate throughout the country Among the slashed programs is financial support to thousands of health workers who havent received salaries from the government for nearly three years Grande said that just a week before the first coronavirus case was announced in Yemen aid agencies had to stop paying health workers Without salaries medical staff wont be able to provide health services to patients amid the pandemic The UN received around 36 billion in 2019 in international donations for its campaign short of its 42 billion goal For its 2020 plan it has so far received only 15 percent out of the needed 35 billion Yemen is war Yemen has been caught in a grinding war since 2014 when Houthi rebels descended from their northern enclave and took over Sanaa forcing the internationally recognized president to flee In the spring of 2015 a USbacked Saudiled coalition began a destructive air campaign to dislodge the Houthis while imposing a land sea and air embargo on Yemen The air war and fighting on the ground has killed more than 100000 people shut down or destroyed half of Yemens health facilities and driven 4 million Yemenis from their homes Cholera epidemics and severe malnutrition among children have led to thousands of additional deaths As the war enters its sixth year with no sign of a viable ceasefire the suffering looks set to continue Fighting has continued unabated along several front lines in Yemen including in Marib an oilrich eastern province threatening new waves of displacement Ten million people on the brink of famine The UNs massive aid programme totalling 835 billion since 2015 is vital to keeping many Yemenis alive Ten million people are on the brink of famine and 80 percent of the 30 million population are in need of aid according to the UN With the coronavirus spreading more money is needed Since April authorities in areas controlled by Yemens internationally recognised government reported 283 cases including 85 deaths The Houthis declared only four cases including one death The World Health Organization believes that there is a significant underestimation of the outbreak which could further hinder efforts to get supplies into Yemen that are needed to contain the virus Richard Brennan the WHOs regional emergency director told the AP that he believes the deaths are in the hundreds and cases in the thousands based on what hes heard from numerous health care providers But he said the lack of funding means the organizations health programmes are hanging by a thread The International Rescue Committee an aid group said Yemen is conducting just 31 tests per one million people among the world is lowest scores With increasing needs and fewer funds the UN refugee agency will have to stop cash assistance and shelter programs for more than 50000 displaced families by August said spokeswoman Heba Kanso She said the agency will be forced to end its partnership with dozens of Yemeni NGOs that will have let go more than 1500

The world is attention is diverted elsewhere and these are the vulnerable among the most vulnerable on the planet and we need a commitment said Brennan

coronavirus pandemic which continues to spread worldwide Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday In an oped published in The Washington Times Cavusoglu said Turkey is among the countries that are taking strong measures to fight the coronavirus which has infected more than one million people globally A global challenge requires a global response first on the public health front and then in the economy and over the long haul in reforming international institutions and the way countries support them he said He called for international institutions to assume an effective role in financial and medical equipment assistance as well as the protection of fragile communities irregular migrants and refugees and support to host countries Global supply networks and cargo transfers must run unhindered he added The minister also took aim at sanctions imposed by world powers saying they not only hurt the designated countries but their neighbors as well Sanctions as a blunt policy tool must be evaluated from the humanitarian point of view At a time of a pandemic this risk is even higher said Cavusoglu citing US sanctions on Iran Developing and leastdeveloped countries notably in Africa must not be left behind In recent days Iran has been asking the US to lift sanctions on humanitarian grounds after getting hurt by the virus It has more than 50000 infections and 3160 deaths according to data from Johns Hopkins University Ending the conflicts Cavusoglu said ending the conflicts around the world which he said claim human lives and hurt ecosystems and economies is a crosscutting theme in the muchneeded global response We therefore call on the international community to step down in all conflicts cease hostilities and search earnestly for dialogue and reconciliation including in the Middle East Geopolitical competitions and political grievances make little sense when the world is fighting for its very health This call cannot go unheeded if we all take a moment to support it worldwide Cavusoglu wrote The top diplomat said the leaders of this generation are defining the future of the world order by the decisions they take today with regard to the pandemic The seeds we sow today will soon confront us as fullblown realities he said The reality of a rulesbased global system a network of functioning nation states that are resilient and accountable economies that leave no one behind and benefit all supported by fitforpurpose international organizations all focusing on the wellbeing of the people irrespective of their nationality faith or race can be within reach Cavusoglu added Global system The top diplomat also criticized the global system which he said had been in ruins before the pandemic He cited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is call for reform in the structure and functioning of the UN Security Council which has been criticized by Turkey for serving the interests of its five permanent members Turkey for one had been making the case that we needed to reform the system We called it the world is larger than five agenda referring to the outdated composition of the UN Security Council but not stopping there As a country that had to address unending conflicts and human misery in our close neighborhood and home to the largest refugee population in the world we have known that the system was not working he said He warned that the economic impact of the pandemic will be daunting and can be longterm The impact on existing state fragilities on politics and security will surely encumber governments around the world said Cavusoglu We have yet to see the light at the end of this tunnel and we cannot wait for it It is a moment of reflection but also leadership and action G20 is role in fighting pandemic Cavusoglu also praised the role of G20 leaders who he said committed to act in solidarity in the fight against the disease and safeguard the global economy and unrestricted trade The extension of SWAP agreements have been among significant measures agreed by the G20 he wrote He said Turkey is proposal to form a Senior Officials Coordination Group was embraced by the G20 leaders as we need to coordinate closely on issues such as border management and repatriation of citizens He thanked Canada for presenting initial ideas on its modalities adding The G20 is proving again to be the right format in global crisis management After first appearing in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December the novel coronavirus officially known as COVID19 has spread to at least 180 countries and

with the pandemic now and in the coming months as food supplies falling and prices soaring and children missing vaccinations and meals The United Nations called on governments companies and billionaires Thursday to contribute to a 67 billion fund for immediate needs in fighting the coronavirus pandemic in vulnerable countries warning that a failure to help could lead to a hunger pandemic famine riots and more conflict UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said that Covid19 has now affected every country and almost every person on the planet He said the UN is initial 2 billion appeals unveiled March 25 was being increased because there is already evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing food supplies falling and prices soaring and children missing vaccinations and meals He added that the peak of the pandemic isnt expected to hit the worlds poorest countries for three to six months Lowcock said in a video briefing launching the new appeal that the poorest countries face a double whammy the health impact of Covid19 and the impact of the global recession and the domestic measures taken to contain the virus We must be prepared for a rise in conflict hunger poverty and disease as economies contract export earnings remittances and tourism disappear and health systems are put under strain he warned Lockdowns and economic recession may mean a hunger pandemic ahead for millions The executive director of the World Food Program David Beasley said there are two keys to averting the possibility of 265 million people being on the brink of famine by the end of the year providing money and keeping supply chains running smoothly The UN appeals to wealthy nations for funding all the time he said but the pandemic is a onetime phenomenon a catastrophe were hitting so its not unreasonable to ask the wealthiest people and the wealthiest companies to give I dont mean just a few million Im talking about hundreds of millions of dollars billions Beasley said He also urged action to address the breakdown of supply chains globally Nations must ensure that we dont have exportimport bans restrictions at borders shutdown of ports shutdown of distribution points he said saying that some countries have already imposed export bans that are having ripple effects on food supplies As an example Beasley said that if young people in urban areas in Africa lose their jobs as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic they dont have bank accounts to fall back on And if they dont have food youre going to have protests riots unrest and destabilization Its going to cost the world a hundredfold more to react after the fact he warned He said that if the world does not respond with sufficient funding it will be catastrophic Were facing a famine of biblical proportions he said We can avert famine if we act and we act now The UNs initial 2 billion appeals have so far raised 1 billion including a lot from Europe Germany Britain the European Commission with contributions also from Japan Persian Gulf countries Canada and others Lowcock said The updated appeal adds nine vulnerable countries to the 54 nations covered in the initial appeal Benin Djibouti Liberia Mozambique Pakistan the Philippines Sierra Leone Togo and Zimbabwe Lowcock said more countries are being monitored for possible addition to the list The 67 billion will fund the UNs humanitarian response plan to help the worlds most vulnerable people deal with the pandemic now and in the coming months Lowcock said the amount will be updated before the end of June because the pandemic has created a very fastmoving situation and will likely be revised upward again to meet needs in 2020 Lowcock also urged international financial institutions and governments to help fragile countries deal with the pandemic and reiterated that 90 billion could provide income support food and health response to Covid19 for 700 million of the worlds most vulnerable people Thats just 1 percent of the 8 trillion stimulus package that the worlds 20 richest countries put in place to save the global economy he said Lowcock has said probably twothirds of the 90 billion could come from international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and onethird from a onetime 20 percent increase in government development assistance Wealthy countries will need to make significant oneoff increases in their foreign aid commitments he said Thursday And international financial institutions will need to change lending agreements with vulnerable countries UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said in the briefing that there has not been a major outbreak of Covid19 in refugee camps but warned that they have an extraordinary vulnerability that needs prevention efforts Dr Mike Ryan who heads the World Health Organizations emergencies operation said that people in such camps cannot maintain physical distance and they have underlying vulnerabilities with no

say these numbers are serious undercounts of the true toll of the pandemic due to limited testing and missed mild cases For months experts have warned of a potential nightmare scenario After overwhelming health systems in some of the world is wealthiest regions the coronavirus gains a foothold in poor or wartorn countries illequipped to contain it and sweeps through the population Now some of those fears are being realised In southern Yemen health workers are leaving their posts en masse because of a lack of protective equipment and some hospitals are turning away patients struggling to breathe In Sudan is warravaged Darfur region where there is little testing capacity a mysterious illness resembling Covid19 is spreading through camps for the internally displaced Cases are soaring in India and Pakistan together home to more than 15 billion people and where authorities say nationwide lockdowns are no longer an option because of high poverty Reaping the whirlwind now In Latin America Brazil has a confirmed caseload and death count second only to the United States and its leader is unwilling to take steps to stem the spread of the virus Alarming escalations are unfolding in Peru Chile Ecuador and Panama even after they imposed early lockdowns The first reports of disarray are also emerging from hospitals in South Africa which has its continents most developed economy Sick patients are lying on beds in corridors as one hospital runs out of space At another an emergency morgue was needed to hold more than 700 bodies We are reaping the whirlwind now said Francois Venter a South African health expert at the University of Witswatersrand in Johannesburg Over 10 million cases worldwide Worldwide there are more than 10 million confirmed cases and over 500000 reported deaths Experts say both those numbers are serious undercounts of the true toll of the pandemic due to limited testing and missed mild cases South Africa has more than a third of Africas confirmed cases of Covid19 It is ahead of other African countries in the pandemic timeline and approaching its peak If its facilities break under the strain it will be a grim forewarning because South Africas health system is reputed to be the continent is best Most poor countries took action early on Some like Uganda which already had a sophisticated detection system built up during its yearslong battle with viral hemorrhagic fever have thus far been arguably more successful than the US and other wealthy countries in battling coronavirus But since the beginning of the pandemic poor and conflictravaged countries have generally been at a major disadvantage and they remain so Its all a domino effect The global scramble for protective equipment sent prices soaring Testing kits have also been hard to come by Tracking and quarantining patients requires large numbers of health workers Its all a domino effect said Kate White head of emergencies for Doctors Without Borders Whenever you have countries that are economically not as well off as others then they will be adversely affected Global health experts say testing is key but months into the pandemic few developing countries can keep carrying out the tens of thousands of tests every week that are needed to detect and contain outbreaks The majority of the places that we work in are not able to have that level of testing capacity and thats the level that you need to be able to get things really under control White said Lockdowns are likely the most effective safeguard but they have exacted a heavy toll even on middleclass families in Europe and North America and are economically devastating in developing countries India is lockdown the world is largest caused countless migrant workers in major cities to lose their jobs overnight Fearing hunger thousands took to the highways by foot to return to their home villages and many were killed in traffic accidents or died from dehydration The government has since set up quarantine facilities and now provides special rail service to get people home safely but there are concerns the migration has already spread the virus to India is rural areas where the health infrastructure is even weaker Hospitals on verge of collapse Poverty has also accelerated the pandemic in Latin America where millions with informal jobs had to go out and keep working and then returned to crowded homes where they spread the virus to relatives Peru is strict threemonth lockdown failed to contain its outbreak and it now has the world is sixthhighest number of cases in a population of 32 million according to Johns Hopkins Intensive care units are nearly 88 percent occupied and the virus shows no sign of slowing Hospitals are on the verge of collapse said epidemiologist Ciro Maguina a professor of medicine at Cayetano Heredia University in the capital Lima Aid groups have tried to help but they have faced their own struggles Doctors Without Borders says the price it pays for masks went up threefold at one point and is still higher than normal The group also faces obstacles in transporting medical supplies to remote areas as international and domestic flights have been drastically reduced And as wealthy donor countries struggle with their own outbreaks there are concerns they will cut back on humanitarian aid Ninety percent of Yemeni patients die at home Mired in civil war for the past five years Yemen was already home to the world is worst humanitarian crisis before the virus hit Now the Houthi rebels are suppressing all

war has blasted key infrastructure Several of the countries are carved up among rival claimant governments factions or armed groups snarling any attempt at nationwide protection programs Hundreds of thousands of people driven from their homes by fighting are crowded in close quarters in tent camps or improper housing We are becoming very worried said John Nkengasong director of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the virus reached conflictridden Iraq Libya Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo The impact will be magnified Most patients who contract the new coronavirus develop only mild symptoms and recover after about two weeks But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by those with no visible symptoms For older adults and people with underlying health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia So far Yemen Libya Syria and Gaza have not confirmed any infections But doctors in many cases believe the virus has arrived and fear that a lack of disease surveillance systems shortages of tests basic supplies and properly trained professionals is allowing an invisible pandemic to spawn Two doctors for 23M in Tripoli We dont have the testing capabilities so we can only rely on symptoms and signs But when I do see symptoms and try to report them no one does anything People go home they go out walk around eat in restaurants said Dr Wejdan Sabri an orthopaedic doctor outside Libyas capital Tripoli I can say with certainty that those likely carrying the virus have continued their lives as normal passing it to family members and others on the street Sabri is one of two volunteer doctors tasked with infectious disease control for the 23 million people in Tripoli which has been a battleground for warring militias She said she has seen at least seven patients in the last few days with the signature symptoms of coronavirus She could only advise them to stay home or visit the central lab in Tripoli where Libyas few dozen

shores in March the coronavirus pandemic that hit Italy hard is putting the country is migrant assistance network in a double emergency As Italian citizens are imposed strict lockdown measures including stringent sanitary rules and social distancing thousands of migrants and refugees who live in precarious conditions are faced with increased risks of infection paired with further social marginalization Experts attribute the almosttotal stop of migrants arrivals this month to the fast spread of the virus in Italy where COVID19 has so far claimed more than 6000 lives a grim world record The curve of arrivals has flattened with the exception of a couple of days in midMarch when around 150 migrants arrived notes Matteo Villa a migration researcher at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies Most of them continue to depart from Libya where the situation is so desperate that the outbreak does not represent a deterrent he adds The first risk now faced by migrants who flee poverty and wars in their home countries is to be brought back to Libya is detention camps by the local coast guard This is currently happening in most of the cases as the rescue ships run by nongovernmental organizations which were once patrolling the central Mediterranean the most deadly route were forced to a halt due to the pandemic According to UN data Italy hosted nearly 300000 refugees and asylum seekers at the end of 2018 Two years later after a crackdown on Italy is migration laws pushed by the League is leader and former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini the number of migrants hosted by Italian reception centers is down to about 85000 For them the coronavirus is making daily life even harder We are seriously worried as many migrants in Italy were already living in critical conditions Now the sanitary standards are reduced to the bare minimum Carlotta Sami UNHCR is spokesperson in Italy told Anadolu Agency So far the only confirmed case of a migrant infected by coronavirus was reported at a reception center in the northern city of Milan one of the worsthit The man who showed only light symptoms was placed in quarantine while half of the migrants hosted by the center were moved to a different building It is really hard to monitor existing cases of coronavirus among migrants We need help from the government said Sami She stressed that the same measures that apply to Italian citizens in terms of prevention and quarantine should also apply to asylum seekers and refugees But the risks of discrimination and social isolation for them remain high If living conditions in the reception centers are deteriorating those in the socalled informal settlements spread across the country often in the countryside or in the outskirts of the largest Italian cities are becoming extreme Limited spaces lack of ventilation systems and the shortage of water and electricity make even the most basic hygiene recommendations like frequent handwashing nearly impossible A contagion within a migrants informal settlement would be a social bomb for the local healthcare services already struggling with the coronavirus emergency and with structural shortages especially in the poorest south where many migrants work in the fields as farmhands We are facing an emergency in the emergency says Andrea Costa coordinator of Baobab Experience a volunteers association that manages a reception camp near Rome is Tiburtina station where around 90 migrants currently live We are doing our best in informing migrants providing them with masks hand sanitizers and basic health screenings But we are running out of human resources as many of our volunteers especially the older ones are quarantined he adds The Italian government has imposed an almosttotal lockdown to its citizens in a desperate effort to contain the epidemic which now counts more than 50000 contagions The mantra Stay Home however sounds paradoxical for many migrants who do not have a house where to stay Integration services for refugees and asylum seekers including key ones like jobsearching and Italian language courses have also been suspended or heavily reduced due to the outbreak That leaves those waiting for a response to their asylum request in a sort of limbo They have the perception of being trapped in a situation with no exit said Luciano Gualzetti the director of Caritas Ambrosiana a religious humanitarian organization that operates in Lombardy the epicenter of the outbreak in the country It is already hard to tolerate a forced cohabitation when there are no outdoor activities that becomes almost impossible To face the emergency humanitarian associations on the frontline like Doctors for Human Rights MEDU have launched special multimedia services and tutorials aimed at supporting migrants further marginalized by the epidemic We were forced to review our operations usually focused on mobile clinics said MEDU coordinator Alberto Barbieri adding Now we provide an overthephone triage and psychological support to homeless migrants who often do not have access even to basic medical assistancej As many other NGOs MEDU used its own resources to provide migrants with the muchneeded protective masks whose shortage has become critical amid the COVID19 spread Now it has run out of them and is urging the government to act soon also providing quarantine spaces for cases of suspected infections in migrants camps Volunteers say most of the migrants are aware of the threat the virus poses but the perception changes from place to place For

a slowmoving prisoner swap that is testing the patience of the erratic warring parties In line with the landmark USTaliban peace agreement cautiously welcomed by the Afghan government which felt sidelined some 5000 Taliban prisoners should have been released from government prisons in exchange for the release of around 1000 security forces weeks ago Onandoff freeing of prisoners But the freeing of prisoners came to a halt this week less than halfway through amid bitter exchanges of allegations and a surge in violence across the warravaged country The country is National Security Council NSC declared that the government would hold up the phased release of insurgents until the Taliban completed the release of at least 200 security forces The government has released 1000 Taliban Now they should release at least 200 security forces in line with the peace agreement the NSC said in a statement Monday Its spokesperson Javed Faisal told Anadolu Agency that the Taliban would be responsible for the failure of the peace deal if they did not comply with the agreed 15 ratio one Afghan service member for five Taliban in the prison swap The government is only committed to take forward the prison exchange if this ratio is complied with and the insurgents stop killing Afghans he said As per the schedule chalked out in the Feb 29 peace accord the Afghan peace process should have been in the crucial intraAfghan phase by now Faisal said that in return for the 1000 Taliban freed from prisons so far the insurgents have so far only freed 105 Afghan security forces Deep distrust at play However defense analyst retired Brig Ali Khail argued that serious differences over the mechanism of the prison swap coupled with a deep mistrust between the Taliban and the Afghan government meant the peace parley missed its deadlines and remained behind schedule Even if you rule out the huge factor of the coronavirus pandemic disrupting everything the officials in charge in Kabul have no confidence in the Taliban insurgents keeping their word in terms of releasing prisoners or ending violence Khail said That is why the Afghan government is cautiously moving ahead with the process while seeking guarantees from wherever it can he told Anadolu Agency According to the USTaliban peace agreement 5000 Taliban prisoners should be released from government prisons and the Taliban should release 1000 security forces before the crucial intraAfghan talks on the future of the country begin The retired Afghan officer who survived the Mujahideen is toppling of the proSoviet government in the late 1980s added there is deeper distrust at play on all sides And if you look at the armed opponents Taliban they continue to defy calls for a ceasefire by the Afghans and the international community while powering through the deadlock in talks by attacking check posts all over the country particularly in rural areas he added Hitting back at the allegations leveled by the Afghan government the Taliban warned Washington of a looming catastrophe in Afghan government prisons in connection with the novel coronavirus Responsibility here falls squarely on the shoulders of the United States of America because if it had shown urgency in the implementation of the agreement we could have made major progress in all facets including the release of prisoners and detainees would have been saved from this danger the group said in a statement The group is Qatar office spokesman Suhail Shaheen on Monday announced the release of 53 more government forces in the northern Badghes and Faryab provinces The Taliban have been blaming the government which they dubbed the Kabul Administration for undermining the peace deal with delays in the prisoner swap According to

held by the insurgents Washington is urgency During his latest round of shuttle diplomacy in the region the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation urged the Taliban to swiftly begin

pace in Uganda there is growing anxiety that it will find its way into refugee settlements Uganda is the largest refugeehosting country on the African continent Countries sending refugees to Uganda include Burundi the Democratic Republic of Congo Eritrea Somalia and South Sudan South Sudanese make up the largest percentage of these refugees due to a conflict that started in 2013 following a falling out between President Salva Kiir and his thendeputy Riek Machar which sparked a civil war The reason refugees prefer Uganda as their home has a lot to do with Ugandan hospitality and the government is refugee policy which has been lauded as one of the most progressive in the world according to the United Nations The policy has been successful because of the willingness of Ugandans to accept refugees on their land and shoulder a big part of their burden Villages across the country agreed to carve up their communally owned land and share it with the refugees often for many years at a time As a result the government has advised ministries that 30 of foreign aid destined for refugees should be spent in ways that benefit refugee host communities including through the construction of schools and health facilities Another major factor is that some Ugandans were refugees before during dictatorships and wars The first wave dates back to the 1966 crisis following the overthrow of

brunt of the new government is wrath as it unleashed terror in revenge against Amin for his alleged mistreatment of people while he was in power in many cases killing his relatives During this period many Ugandans fled to Zaire now the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan In the 1980s more Ugandans became refugees in neighboring countries due to the guerrilla war launched by current President Yoweri Museveni who has been in power for more than 30 years Another wave swept through during the 1990s and 2000s when Joseph Kony the founder and leader of the rebel group Lord is Resistance Army LRA terrorized northern Uganda leaving a trail of kidnapped children and mutilated victims Many Ugandans found refuge in what is today South Sudan Tired of being treated as refugees Ugandans followed events back home and participated in domestic politics to stabilize the country Unlike the past Uganda is now stable and peaceful which is the reason refugees find it appealing as a safe haven By February 2020 Uganda had over 14 million refugees Uganda is Minister for Relief Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Musa Ecweru told Anadolu Agency that Uganda has an open refugee policy While some rich Western nations are building walls to keep out refugees and closing borders turning them away ours is in an open border policy for refugees fleeing catastrophes from across Africa he said Although there have not been any confirmed COVID19 case in the refugee settlements there is growing anxiety arising from the increasing number of confirmed cases in Uganda which has surpassed 700 Refugee committees are mobilizing a range of preventative measures Due to the nature of the refugee settlements and daily contact with refugees selfisolation and social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID19 are nearly impossible to implement Some international humanitarian organizations have significantly reduced their number of staff and funding is stretched to the breaking point while some have pulled out their staff At the beginning of April this year the World Food Programme WFP announced a 30 reduction in food rations for all refugees due to uncertainty over the sustainability of supplies worsening the situation Organizations like the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency TIKA which have played an important role in providing assistance to refugee settlements in northern Uganda are yet to directly aid refugees during this time Some refugees Anadolu Agency spoke to said they were less afraid of the virus than of its secondary consequences The lockdown restricting their movement in and out of the settlements has eroded their already limited opportunities for alternative income in the host communities making them solely dependent on humanitarian assistance for their essential needs I operate a small shop in Old Kampala but currently things are hard We used to buy merchandise for sale but the movement is not allowed now People are not there in the market and survival is now hard because I have to buy soap and essentials for the children said Atuwa Mihali a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo In Uganda is capital Kampala many refugees face severe food shortages because of the lockdown The government has asserted that refugees should be in the camps and that nonnationals will not get food aid except in refugee settlements Minister Musa Ecweru said the government is focusing on refugee settlements to protect them from COVID19 and is ensuring that refugees still have access to all of the services entitled to them including food water and healthcare ÇARE Derneği has distributed packages of flour soap beans sugar and cooking oil to some poor and needy members of the community The World Health Organization has warned that the mortality rates for COVID19 could be unprecedented in vulnerable communities and in fragile contexts like refugee settlements The organization has asked that countries hosting high numbers of refugees be given urgent support because the impact the pandemic could have on these countries would be far greater than what it has seen to date in more medically advanced countries Speaking to Anadolu Agency Dr Ed Menya a PhD candidate pursuing Law at Istanbul University said the emergency response should be geared towards bringing relief to refugees who survived the war but now face an even bigger enemy COVID19 putting their very existence at risk Uganda strives to protect refugees from COVID19

in the country give priority first to their own hospitals in its battle against the coronavirus The critical shortage of medical supplies across the US including testing swabs protective masks surgical gowns and hand sanitiser can be tied to a sudden drop in imports mostly from China The Associated Press has found Trade data shows the decline in shipments started in midFebruary after the spiralling coronavirus outbreak in China led the country to shutter factories and disrupted ports Some emergency rooms hospitals and clinics in the US have now run out of key medical supplies while others are rationing personal protective equipment like gloves and masks The United States counts on receiving the vast majority of its medical supplies from China where the coronavirus has infected more than 80000 people and killed more than 3200 When Chinese medical supply factories began coming back online last month their first priority was their own hospitals The government required makers of N95 masks to sell all or part of their production internally instead of shipping masks to the US The most recent delivery of medicalgrade N95 masks arrived from China about a month ago on February 19 And as few as 13 shipments of nonmedical N95 masks have arrived in the past month half as many as arrived the same month last year N95 masks are used in industrial settings as well as hospitals and filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles including ones too tiny to be blocked by regular masks Governors in panic Governors across the country are becoming panicked as states run out of equipment President Donald Trump has urged them to buy masks on the open market but few if any are available Without adequate protection more of our hospital staff could become ill which would mean there wouldnt be people to care for patients said Nancy Foster the American Hospital Associations vice president of quality and patient safety policy Some hospitals are down to just a day or two of personal protective equipment she said The AP found that in the past month hand sanitiser and swab imports both dropped by 40 percent N95 mask imports were down 55 percent and surgical gowns typically sourced from China were at near normal levels because the sourcing was shifted to Honduras Typically medical supplies are delivered along both coasts But almost all the supplies that did arrive in the past month came into Newark New Jersey across the country from the earliest and most severe coronavirus outbreaks The AP identified the falling imports by looking at shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc services that independently track global trade Steep surge in demand In midFebruary the World Health Organization warned that global demand for safety gear for medical providers was 100 times higher than normal Prices were 20 times higher stockpiles were depleted and there was a four to sixmonth backlog Despite this federal contracting data shows there was no big effort at that point to submit orders Trade policies have not helped Tariffs on medical supplies made them more expensive and they were only lifted March 5 even though health care associations asked the administration last year to exempt items like masks gloves and gowns And now countries including South Korea India and Taiwan are blocking exports of medical supplies to save them for their own citizens leaving the US with fewer options The lag time could be weeks It could be upward of months said Khatereh Calleja CEO of the Healthcare Supply Chain Association Doctors nurses and first responders in the US are resorting to spraying their masks with bleach at the end of each day and hanging them up at home to dry to use for another day according to the American College of Emergency Physicians There is a little bit of anxiety as you can imagine going to work and not knowing if you will have enough personal protective equipment said Dr David Tan president of the National Association of EMS Physicians The decline in swabs included multiple varieties not just ones needed to test for Covid19 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for weeks warned state and local health departments about shortages of swabs which are needed for the testing that is critical to containing the pandemic Even overthecounter medical shipments are decreasing Ten shipping containers filled with medical thermometers arrived at US ports a year ago this month But in the last 30 days there were just five Hand sanitiser also commonly sourced from China has disappeared from US stores and it may stay scarce Last year by this time 223 shipments had arrived This year since January just 157 shipments have come The shortages affect patients because they cant get tested and their providers may be carrying the virus from one person to the next But the far greater risk is to medical personnel Already there are reports of dozens of doctors nurses and medical staff who have contracted the virus Nurses across the country report that they are not receiving the proper personal protective equipment and their hospitals do not have the isolation rooms they need to safely care for Covid19 patients according to National Nurses United the largest union of registered nurses in the US Its not safe at all Nobody is safe said Consuelo Vargas an emergency room nurse at Cook County Hospital in Chicago On Friday morning after a possible exposure at work she went to a local hardware store and bought all the painter booties and jumpsuits they had to wear while caring for people Its so frustrating because we feel like health care workers are being asked for a lot and thats fine we can do our job Were just asking for the equipment we need she said Shortage affect humanitarian assistance The shortage does not affect only health care The humanitarian medical firm Direct Relief thought it was heading into 2020 wellstocked with several million N95 masks The organisation had increased its orders in 2019 after massive wildfires in the West filled cities with smoke squeezing its supplies in recent years But then bushfires overwhelmed Australia with smoky skies and so Direct Relief began sending the masks there vice president Tony Morain said When the coronavirus hit China the organisation began shipping the masks to Wuhan the outbreak is epicentre in an effort to contain the disease Morain said theyve ordered 2 million more masks and are awaiting the shipments Those typically take at least five weeks to arrive two weeks to make the masks two weeks of shipping and a week to get through the port Meanwhile he said Direct Relief has received well over 100 requests from hospitals and health centres down to their last boxes In an effort to fill the gap Minnesotabased 3M is running its Aberdeen South Dakota plant around the clock producing millions of N95 masks per month The company is also ramping up production of surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions CEO Mike Roman said Nonetheless one federal contract with 3M for 48 million of N95 masks dated March 12 says the masks will be delivered April 30 seven weeks later according to public contract data A number of Chinese companies told the AP this week that they will be resuming exports which bring higher prices but that they are overwhelmed and cannot meet demand Chinese mask manufacturers have received too many orders from abroad but have no time to produce all of them and make a delivery said David Peng manager of Ningbo Buy Best International Trading Co Ltd Trade data shows importers have managed to maintain some supplies by shifting to factories outside China Shipments of surgical gowns for example have dropped less than 5 percent since December since they are now coming from Honduras The same is true for medical gloves which are now primarily coming from South Korea The federal government said a national stockpile was being made available at the state level but governors said they were not getting what they need I think every governor in the United States has been banging on the door of the federal government with respect to the stockpile We certainly have and were going to continue to Massachusetts Gov Charlie Baker said at a news conference this week Dr Peter ChinHong an infectiousdisease specialist at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco said he was alarmed by new CDC advice for hospitals that run out of masks For the CDC to say people can wear bandanas is actually quite frightening he said I never thought the CDC would say something like that Were in the United States of America in 2020 and we have a recommendation to use bandanas

journalism in Turkey and continues his freelance journalism activities about Iran in Turkey ISTANBUL Right after its outbreak in China the coronavirus drew attention to its new reach in Iran taking lives of many victims in Iran after China But the outbreak has been brought to the fore by the nonchalance of the administration as well as the rapidly rising number of cases since it emerged in Iran As Iranian officials defied the clear warnings of medical science they insisted on not quarantining the city of Qom which has been identified as the center of the virus The Iranian authorities who did not do the slightest health check even in overcrowded places such as shrines in the city soon saw the coronavirus among themselves The mayor lawmakers and a deputy minister tested positive for coronavirus and there are rumors that many other senior officials have also been infected As for the impact of the virus which has become a nightmare for the world also on the streets of Iran there was a seriousness at first influenced by the administration is attitude But as the days progressed and the deaths caused by the virus showed their face there was a huge infestation in the community The lurking cases and the death toll and the lack of transparency that has become a state tradition in Iran have fueled public panic but have also shaken confidence in the administration All this showed that the real crisis was not coronavirus but the fact that the people is trust in the state was completely lost The Iranian public thinks that the crisis is not being handled well while the fear of coronavirus grows Coronavirus was to be looked forward to Iranians knew that the coronavirus was going to come to their own country sooner or later right after it has occurred in China Although the whole world has shut down its doors to China as a precaution Iranian Mahan Airlines was continuing its flights to China Iran is Cabinet banned any transfers and direct flights to China but only on Feb 1 But despite that decision Mahan admitted it had only carried out at least nine flights to several cities in China on Feb 15 Also on Feb 2 China is Ambassador to Tehran Chang Hua shared on Twitter that he had met with company officials and that they wanted to continue cooperation Some Iranian lawmakers have criticized health officials saying there is a danger of a coronavirus outbreak in the country because of the rant provided to the airlines Since then reactions to these flights have increased and there has even been talks on Iran becoming a terminal for third countries due to its flights and of the claims that the airlines of this country have transferred passengers they do not want to take directly from China through this Iranian company When we revisit the process from the emergence of the virus in China to the present day we can see that the coronavirus was actually almost looking forward to Iran A significant outrage occurred in the society as the deaths caused by the virus had shown their faces The lurking cases and the death toll and the lack of transparency that has become a state tradition in Iran have fueled public panic but have also shaken confidence in the administration They always failed Iran probably lives the most surging period of its history Even listing the events occurred in the last few months is now hard Moreover they all have something in common In each crisis the state gets a little further away from the public The widespread public reaction to the suddenly announced petrol hike in November was gorily suppressed Although the street movements that spread to many cities in Iran started with the petrol hike the negative effect that this hike would bring to the rising cost of living was enough to lift all cities up Parliament is attempt to undo the resolution was turned down by the intervention of the revolutionary leader and the government is irresponsible attendance at the process was the last straw The petrol hike which is thought to repair the Iranian budget weakened by the embargoes has almost had an ember effect on the country is life Despite all these reactions and negative developments there is no change in approach in the administration Even though the claim that 1500 people were killed in three or four days was always refuted by the administration the real death wounded or arrested toll is not explained despite all the reactions Later the killing of Qasem Soleimani the commander of the Quds Force in Tehran is hands in the region by the US in Iraq severely damaged Iran is reputation in the region Iran which had spread Soleimani is funeral in several cities for days was intent on taking the maximum advantage of this affair but it did not happen This success of the administration which knew how to bring the Iranian people together around Soleimani to a considerable extent was largely overshadowed by the lack of organization at the funeral with dozens of people killed in the stampede in Kerman There are also claims that Iran which announced its attack on the US base in Iraq had gotten in touch with the US officials and informed them of the operation at issue But Iran has tried to make the situation propaganda material to a maximum extent inside and outside the country saying We got our revenge by shooting down the US But that joy did not last long In a sense the shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner from Tehran by the Revolutionary Guards Army which was supposed to be a US missile has caused serious damage to Iran is prestige by zeroing in on its military strength and selfconfidence The fact that all these matters were hidden from the public and from the world has moved the events to even more grave points This incident despite its severity was kept for three days with the knowledge of its senior officials Different theses and conspiracy theories were produced to distort the matter and in its simplest form the public was lied to Afterwards upon the pressure by the Canadian and Ukrainian authorities and external pressure they had to admit that the passenger plane had been shot down Following this incident no Iranian official especially members of the Revolutionary Guards Army has been removed from his post and no one has been prosecuted and brought before the law On the other hand Iranian society who had reacted towards the incident had faced the steel fist of the administration just like in similar incidents Iran which had thought to clench the public by using especially the death of Soleimani and unite people against the statedefined enemy had lost everything in one moment and found the public against its own self In Iran which has already broken nationstate relations the public is trust in the state has been severely shaken and the public has become even more suspicious of everything How many votes count for public lives A case of coronavirus was identified in Iran by authorities for the first time on Feb 19 But what aroused public suspicion was that coronavirus was made public with the first deaths not with one suspected case in Iran Taking into account that the incubation period of the virus lasts from 14 to 27 days we can see again what a catastrophe it is on the verge of Given the rapid transmission of the virus it is clear that each minute could cost more people their lives It is no secret that the Iranian state especially the Revolutionary Leader Ali Khamenei cares about the high turnout in the elections especially in terms of an image of legitimacy against the world Therefore the high turnout at all costs was treated as a matter of lifeanddeath especially in the last parliamentary election when the competition was not possible due to political pressures When one looks at the pulse of the public in this context it appears that the presence of coronavirus is hidden from the public eye due to election concerns The political approach that Iranian officials have taken on a fantastically sensitive humanitarian issue such as health is in fact proof of how true this point of view can be The enemies started a propaganda war by using coronavirus as a pretext and attacking the country Khamenei said in his first statement President Hassan Rouhani made a similar comment stressing that the enemy should not be given an opportunity to deal with coronavirus It is possible that we see health officials among the ones who had approached the incident in a political way since the beginning As a matter of fact Iranian Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said Iran was engaged in a propaganda war claiming that 28 million people died in the US in the same time period in which 108 people died of the flu in Iran this year alone by suggesting that the state channel had misrepresented the country is health status on the issue of coronavirus The gasoline hike and those killed in November the ones that lost their lives in the stampede at Soleimani is funeral the downed Ukrainian plane an uncompetitive election whose candidates were vetoed and many other issues that caused Iranians dissatisfaction have now been replaced by coronavirus alone The point Iranians who were mentioning radical issues like the regime change just a couple of weeks ago have reached now is a matter of life The question of whether the Iranian people who have lost confidence in the state and lost hope for tomorrow would choose to surrender or rebel to the fate of the regime imposed upon them after this crisis is difficult to find an answer to before the coronavirus crisis is over

camps four to five stay in a single makeshift room made of tarpaulin sheets and bamboo sticks he said Most of us sleep on plastic paper spreading on muddy floor in the tents We have fewer options to

armed groups have heeded to the call of a ceasefire by the UN amid the coronavirus pandemic But the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir is a far cry from peace The New People is Army the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines announced a ceasefire in its 50year war in late March to ensure that all citizens can access testing and treatment In Colombia a leftwing armed group the National Liberation Army ELN declared a month is ceasefire starting on April 1 In southern Thailand local armed groups decided to postpone hostilities until the pandemic is brought under control The 7th Astana summit was held via teleconference with the participation of the foreign ministers of three guarantor countries Turkey Russia and Iran Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Twitter that the main subject of the summit was the coronavirus outbreak and the latest situation on the ground in Syria Thanks to the TurkishRussianbrokered ceasefire 18500 refugees returned to the Syrian warravaged province of Idlib in March The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait offered Iran the center of one of the worst initial outbreaks outside China humanitarian assistance Ironically while guns are falling silent in the world to focus on the pandemic they are blazing loudly in Jammu and Kashmir The COVID19 pandemic may have claimed just five lives in the troubled region so far but the armed conflict has taken away 48 lives since the start of the outbreak The month of April alone witnessed 35 deaths including a toddler who was killed when Indian and Pakistani armies used heavy artillery last week to target each other is positions The deceased included 11 security force personnel four civilians and 20 militants When the tsunami struck the Indian Ocean in December 2004 killing 250000 people in more than a dozen countries it brought a peace deal in Aceh Indonesia The government troops pulled out of Aceh and rebels disarmed ending a decadeslong separatist insurgency in the country Less than a year later following an earthquake that killed 90000 people in Kashmir region in October 2005 South Asian rivals India and Pakistan agreed to open five crossing points along the highly militarized Line of Control LoC to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid Disasters and peace Evidence shows that natural disasters have often created ripe moments for conflict resolution by increasing the probability of ceasefires and talks Analyzing 405 different disasters in 21 countries Joakim Kreutz a Swedish expert on peace and conflict studies found that talks were initiated and ceasefires were concluded in many regions following disasters Interestingly he found that disasters did bring parties together to explore peace but only if victims were between 30000153885 or if the disaster had affected more than one million victims The phenomenon indicated that parties came together because disasters had hit their resources Therefore they found an incentive in launching talks concluded the research that was undertaken by Kreutz a teacher at the University of Uppsala near Stockholm Spanish researcher LesleyAnn Daniels who had analyzed the Indonesian peace deal said it was not the tsunami itself but its consequences that brought the parties to enter into a peace agreement The arrival of the international community changed the dynamics of the conflict encouraging the Indonesian government into negotiations and legitimizing the Free Aceh Movement she said in her research Oversight of international community She said that an external shock such as the coronavirus could pause a conflict but does not change the underlying structures of the conflict that include territory that groups control the access to weapons and funding unless there is oversight from the international community such as UN peacekeepers or international mediators The rebel groups are reassured that the international community will hold the national government to account later if it betrays the terms of the agreement she added According to Londonbased Conciliation Resources CR an international organization mediating in violent conflict disasters do provide opportunities to build back better both in terms of building more adequate infrastructure and robust buildings and also in terms of strengthening community resilience Under the right circumstances natural disasters can contribute to restoring trust increasing empathy among divided groups through shared grief and can enable those affected to learn from one another said Shafat Ahmed who authored a paper for CR on disaster preparedness and response in Kashmir He maintained that in an environmentally fragile and conflictridden region like Kashmir disasters can create opportunities for increased cooperation and understanding within and between the communities on either side and across the LoC the de facto border which divides the disputed region between India and Pakistan Shyam Saran India is foreign secretary from 20042006 said the humanitarian issues affecting people on both sides of the LoC were behind the Indian proposal for allowing the meeting of families in Kashmir at five designated places on the dividing line The proposed places were Mendhar Poonch Suchetgarh Uri and Tangdhar along the Neelam Valley Earlier both countries had launched the SrinagarMuzaffarabad bus service in April 2005 and then the PoonchRawalakote route was opened for travel in June 2006 Then Minister of External Affairs Pranab Mukherjee said the expansion of peopletopeople contacts including through trade and commerce will provide an effective platform to develop and strengthen bilateral relations Revive crossLoC trade to defeat contraction In the wake of predictions that the COVID19 pandemic will contract global trade it has become all the more necessary to revive the crossLoC trade in Jammu and Kashmir to sustain localized supply chain Last year in April India suspended this trade which was going via two trade facilitation centers Salamabad and ChakandaBagh citing concerns about security involving illegal inflows of weapons narcotics and currency into India The trade initiated in October 2008 as a confidencebuilding measure between India and Pakistan allowed people on the two sides to trade 21 products on a barter system for four days a week Between 20082019 goods worth 75 billion Indian rupees 987 million were traded They also generated 170000 job days and freight revenue of about 660 million Indian rupees 86 million was earned by local transporters With livelihoods already shrinking the coronavirus crises now have made it almost impossible for traders laborers and transporters to seek alternate avenues in the wake of the suspension of this trade Putting forth stronger and more transparent crossLoC trade mechanisms can help respond to some of the economic standstill resulting from the lockdowns Kashmir experiences over the past nine months Speaking to Anadolu Agency Afaq Hussain director at the Bureau of Research on Industry and Economic Fundamentals BRIEF said as the coronavirus crisis has put globalization into reverse there is a case to focus on the development of regional value chains with countries in the neighborhood CrossLoC trade if revived can make for such a value chain fitting in the postCOVID19 market structures catering to the local market of Jammu Kashmir and reviving the economic ecosystem created by this trade he said His associate Nikita Singla believes in the times of saving lives and livelihoods for the sake of local economy and population of troubled Jammu and Kashmir it would be in their interest to revive the crossLoC trade with revised operating procedures Unfreeze SAARC Retired Gen Harcharanjit Singh Panag who had commanded Indian troops in Kashmir said that COVID19 has come as an opportunity for India and Pakistan to move forward to end hostilities The magnitude of the coronavirus crisis allows both countries to gracefully alter their rigid attitude and sell the idea to the emotional population and other stakeholders without giving up their perceived selfrighteous stands he said The pandemic may have shut down political mobilization and convinced protesters to stay at home all over the world But popular grievances are likely to get further exacerbated by the pandemic and could make them even more volatile and bring new cycles of instability The aftermath of disease coupled with economic catastrophe could sow the seeds of further disorder Experts also believe that it is time to unfreeze the eightmember SAARC South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation to allow some diplomatic activity in the region more so between India and Pakistan An important question haunting the diplomatic community is whether Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan will be able to travel to New Delhi to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO summit scheduled in September They believe that the unfreezing of SAARC will kickstart diplomatic activity in the region and thus help Khan to visit New Delhi and meet his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the summit sidelines But after all diplomacy depends on leaders If parties seek peace then they can use COVID19 to extend the hand of friendship and seek cooperation If they do not want peace then dealing with an emergency can be used to score points and drive the two sides further apart Can pandemic catalyze diplomacy to end conflicts

sent aid and medical supplies to over 57 countries to support efforts against the COVID19 pandemic It is no secret that the United Kingdom has one of Europes largest numbers of COVID19 fatalities Therefore the UK government is under growing pressure for its lack of preparedness The shortage of personal protection equipment PPE in the country is a case in point More than 20000 people including at least 100 National Health Service NHS health care workers have now died with coronavirus in UK hospitals the fifth country to pass that milestone The PPE scantiness caused controversy among health care workers who criticize the government for failing to protect them adequately Turkey as an ally and a close friend of the UK stepped in and donated 250000 PPE including 50000 N95 facemasks 100000 surgical masks and 100000 protective suits Following this generous action the UK has requested that Turkey supply another 84 tons of PPE including 400000 gowns Summarizing Turkeys solidarity the medical supplies that were provided had a famous quote by 13thcentury Islamic scholar and poet Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi inscribed on the crates There is hope after despair and many suns after darkness Turkish authorities also attached a letter from President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wishing Johnson a prompt recovery from COVID19 President Erdoğan said the military cargo plane was sent to demonstrate solidarity with friend and ally the United Kingdom which is having a hard time While many European countries including the UK are in desperate need of PPE currently a highly valued commodity in the world some governments including France and Germany have either restricted or banned the export of PPE to other countries French President Emmanuel Macron went to the extent of signing a decree that enables the government to requisition all necessary products in the fight against COVID19 and French authorities have forced a French mask manufacturing company to cancel a major order from the UK France has not only banned the export of PPE to other European partners but has also confiscated other nations PPE orders The French authorities seized an order for 4 million masks which were destined for Italy and Spain the hardesthit countries by COVID19 After 15 days of intense pressure from the Swedish government the French authorities were finally forced to hand over the masks to Italy and Spain its original destinations In contrast Turkey as a major manufacturer of medical equipment distributes PPE to its citizens and residents free of charge It is worth noting that Turkeys Ministry of National Defense alone produces 10 million masks per week In addition to the UK Turkey has sent aid and medical supplies to over 57 countries to support efforts against the COVID19 pandemic Turkeys humanitarian diplomacy did not go unnoticed When some European nations dragged their feet in the face of hardship Turkey showed its true qualities Turkeys generous assistance to its allies exemplifies what genuine international solidarity looks like Besides Turkeys humanitarian motivations Turkeys medical assistance to the UK has implications for bilateral relations Ties in postBrexit era TurkeyUK relations have reached extraordinary levels in the last decade Both countries have been enjoying wellestablished relations based on their NATO membership mutual economic interests and shared security concerns The UK is Turkeys secondbiggest trading partner after Germany with a volume of 185 billion and one of the countries that have the most investments in Turkey However some uncertainty lingered in the air after the UK officially left the European Union on January 31 As Turkeys trade with the UK is mostly done within the scope of the customs union the UKs exit from the EU raised some questions about the trade relations between the countries In the meantime the two countries have already established working groups at a ministerial level and unofficial talks are taking place for expanding the scope of bilateral trade after Brexit Turkey is expecting a separate free trade deal that will keep commerce flowing between both sides Likewise the UK has listed Turkey as one of its target trade partners for the postBrexit era Turkeys assistance came at a time when the UK government was under significant pressure The planeloads of PPE will certainly bring some needed relief for health care workers and will alleviate some of the public is criticism of Johnson The unprecedented display of solidarity during the pandemic will likely pave the way for closer cooperation between the two nations in the future This article was originally published in the Daily Sabah is Opinion section Disclaimer The viewpoints expressed by the

in Istanbul Turkey ISTANBU Libya is internationally recognized Government of National Accord GNA forces advanced 1 on Tarhouna a vital support base for warlord Khalifa Haftar and his last stronghold in the area surrounding Tripoli The advance comes days after UNbacked troops retaking 2 of strategic cities in the west of Tripoli including Sabratha Surman and alAjaylat which were key towns that served as a base for forces loyal to warlord Haftar After being removed from the west of Tripoli Haftar is militias turned their rage 3 on civilians in the capital Over the past few weeks Haftar is militias have escalated their use of artillery shells in Tripoli is densely inhabited area The capture of coastal cities as well as advancing on Tarhouna is seen as a significant blow to Haftar and his backers a year after he launched an offensive on the capital The latest territorial loss has further hampered militia leader Haftar is chances of taking Tripoli Haftar seems to be more adept at propaganda than war per se His perception management machine is accustomed to making unsubstantiated announcements of imaginary military advances and victories The ongoing fighting the use of fighter jets and drone strikes have had a humanitarian fallout but led to no clear advantage for Haftar is forces The war continues to rage while according to the UN 4 in the last year alone over 2000 people have died including hundreds of civilians 150000 people have been displaced from their homes along the Tripoli frontline and are looking for temporary shelters Refugees and migrants are the most vulnerable groups in the war The UN and aid agencies have called on 5 Libya is conflicting parties to halt the fighting However the battle has intensified in the last couple of weeks with a number of rockets hitting 6 a hospital in the UNbackedgovernmentGNAheld area of Tripoli The UN condemned 7 the shelling of the hospital in Tripoli calling it a clear violation of international law but even this official condemnation amounts to barely anything Years of war have created conditions that accelerate the spread of the virus and the Haftar forces pushing to capture Tripoli appear to be exploiting the pandemic to inflict the utmost casualties on civilians by shelling areas where people are trapped at home under the curfew as the coronavirus is threatening an already shattered health system The World Health Organization WHO representative in Tripoli has warned 8 of the significant risks that will be faced if COVID19 spreads in a country where the ongoing conflict will make combating the outbreak very difficult Recently Turkey sent medical supplies to Libya to help fight the novel coronavirus while the world at large is mainly focused elsewhere on fighting the pandemic in their own countries And so many Libyans are left to their own devices merely waiting to see just how far the war and the virus will spread Reportedly there are 49 confirmed 9 cases of the coronavirus in Libya as of April 18 but testing is very limited and the number is most likely to grow The UN and the EU called 10 on the warring parties to stop fighting to make it easier to deal with the virus Instead of ending the offensive on humanitarian grounds Haftar is forces have continued their assaults only to show that the UN and the EU have failed miserably again in their most recent call for a truce The UN has been encouraging diplomatic efforts while the failure of previous initiatives 11 the arms buildup and Haftar is history of undermining political solutions make it harder for any credible diplomatic effort toward ending the conflict in Libya to take hold Haftar is latest assault on Tripoli shows that his goal is to impose military rule over the rest of the country as he has done in the east In the meantime Haftar is socalled Libyan National Army LNA artillery attacks are ruthless designed to harass Tripoli is innocent residents indiscriminately Forces loyal to Haftar seized large export terminals 12 and cut off major pipelines in January aiming to choke the UNbacked government of significant revenue which is brutal punishment Civilians in Libya are suffering deeply from a war with largescale electricity water and gas cuts and there is limited funding in the government treasury for the oilrich Libya to pay for imports such as medical supplies which will surely make it harder to battle the coronavirus The situation in Libya is getting worse day by day making life even more difficult for so many civilians living with war and the new threat of the coronavirus Haftar forces should stop shelling Tripoli is residential neighborhoods since this shelling only fuels more conflict and destruction Meanwhile Libyan people urgently need greater support and resources to cope with the virus Otherwise people will continue to suffer under what are already horrendous conditions Opinions expressed in this article are the author is own and do not necessarily reflect the

Francisco Nieto who works in a hospital in the border state of Tachira In May Nieto recalled after two months of quarantine 18monthold twins arrived with bodies bloated from malnutrition The childrens mother was jobless and living with her own mother She told the doctor she fed them only a simple drink made with boiled bananas Not even a cracker Some chicken he asked Nothing the childrens grandmother responded By the time the doctor saw them it was too late One boy died eight days later The leaders of four international agencies the World Health Organization UNICEF the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization have called for at least 24 billion immediately to address global hunger But even more than lack of money restrictions on movement have prevented families from seeking treatment said Victor Aguayo the head of UNICEFs nutrition program Chaos and disorder By having schools closed by having primary health care services disrupted by having nutritional programs dysfunctional we are also creating harm Aguayo said He cited as an example the nearglobal suspension of Vitamin A supplements which are a crucial way to bolster developing immune systems In Afghanistan movement restrictions prevent families from bringing their malnourished children to hospitals for food and aid just when they need it most The Indira Gandhi hospital in the capital Kabul has seen only three or four malnourished children said specialist Nematullah Amiri Last year there were 10 times as many Because the children dont come in theres no way to know for certain the scale of the problem but a recent study by Johns Hopkins University indicated an additional 13000 Afghans younger than 5 could die Afghanistan is now in a red zone of hunger with severe childhood malnutrition spiking from 690000 in January to 780000 a 13 increase according to UNICEF In Yemen restrictions on movement have blocked aid distribution along with the stalling of salaries and price hikes The Arab worlds poorest country is suffering further from a fall in remittances and a drop in funding from humanitarian agencies On the edge Yemen is now on the brink of famine

coronavirus crisis terrifying news comes out each hour as the number of reported cases and the global death toll continue rising The disease has been targeting all continents save Antarctica while recognising no geographical political economic religious or ideological identities or boundaries The very nature of this pandemic underscores the need for global cooperation in a struggle that must involve all governments and societies across the world As Covid19 keeps on spreading new bonds of international solidarity are on display In certain instances transregional assistance has taken scores of foreign affairs analysts by surprise It is remarkable that China Russia and Cuba rather than the US are the countries doing the most to help fight coronavirus across Italy a western country which has traditionally aligned extremely closely with Washington throughout the postWorld War II era In other cases the pandemic is prompting states with a history of tense bilateral relations to come to each others aid A notable example is the assistance which Iran has received from the United Arab Emirates UAE this month Yet when it comes to international efforts aimed at solving the pandemic Washington is playing a harmful role While federal state and local officials in the US attempt to contain the transmission of coronavirus in American cities and states the Trump administrations sanctions policies are undermining foreign governments abilities to do the same in their own countries That the US is sticking to such foreign policy tactics to isolate and weaken certain countries amid this global crisis is fueling much outrage worldwide UN officials and various heads of state have called on the Trump administration to liftease sanctions on these countries in order to help their governments and by extension the rest of the world deal with the coronavirus On March 24 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet had a message from the Trump administration Humanitarian exemptions to sanctions measures should be given broad and practical effect with prompt flexible authorization for essential medical equipment and supplies The UN listed Cuba North Korea Venezuela and Zimbabwe as countries where sanctions will severely undermine medical efforts to contain coronavirus In a letter written to the G20 countries UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres wrote I am encouraging the waiving of sanctions imposed on countries to ensure access to food essential health supplies and COVID19 medical support This is the time for solidarity not exclusion Let us remember that we are only as strong as the weakest health system in our interconnected world On March 13 Chinas Foreign Ministry accused Washington of being stubborn in sanctioning Venezuela showing not the least respect for humanitarianism One week later Pakistans Prime Minister Imran Khan urged the US to end unjust sanctions on Iran where one of its citizens dies from coronavirus every ten minutes Nonetheless the Trump administration has voiced its opposition to lifting sanctions on Iran in order to make a humanitarian exception to maximum pressure As the Atlantic Councils Kirsten Fontenrose recently argued there are three main reasons why First the US administrations perception is that sanctions on Tehran are achieving their goals Second the White House keeps on emphasising that medical material is directly not targeted by sanctions This is true but does not change the fact that sanctions are thwarting international financial transactions because banks do not want to handle such transactions due to their fears of US sanctions making it next to impossible for Iran to access badly needed medical devices Third there is a lack of any international or domestic pressure on the Trump administration to ease sanctions on Tehran Yet the US leaderships use of sanctions as a foreign policy tool to weaken certain countries amid the coronavirus crisis will have many unforeseen consequences As the pandemic does not know any borders Irans neighbors including Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan could easily suffer much from this disease in the days and weeks ahead With many Shia Muslims from Afghanistan and Iraq visiting Iran for religious purposes these two wartorn countries remain incredibly vulnerable to outbreaks Unquestionably Covid19 outbreaks anywhere in the world threaten every member of the international community If the pandemic continues ravaging Iran it would be naive to believe that such a worsening nightmare in the Islamic Republic would not at least at some point harm vital US interests and those of Washingtons allies particularly those in the Middle East and Greater Central Asia It would behove the American president and those around him to consider longerterm ramifications on the international stage Even after a vaccine is developed governments and societies all over the world will remember how global powers acted amid this crisis For decades people of all nationalities will remember that Beijing delivered acid testing kits and Chinese medical experts to the Middle Easts worst hit country while Cuba sent its doctors to Italy The contrast between China and the USs responses and strategies for handling this global disease will inevitably shape perceptions of these two superpowers in countless countries Ultimately as power shifts away from the US in a world that is growing increasingly multipolar the pandemic is informative of the demise of Washington as an international leader On March 23 the EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated that Europe will send Iran 20 million in aid and support Irans first help request to the International Monetary Fund since the countrys 1979 revolution That the USs western allies are refusing to help the Trump administration advance its antiIranian agenda highlights the extent to which European governments as well as states worldwide are looking less and less to Washington for leadership on global issues Even if a new administration takes over in January it would not be easy for the US to recover from the damage done to Americas reputation as a global leader amid this terrifying crisis We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion please send them via email to opinioneditorialtrtworldcom

communication classes for members of the Turkish Army and at the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency TIKA and the Anadolu Agency News Academy He focuses on public diplomacy new media policies and the management of migration ISTANBUL As the coronavirus pandemic continues around the world the period of normalization is coming to Europe in a gradual manner One of the regions of the world most affected by the outbreak with more than one million 705 thousand cases diagnosed Europe has lost almost 165 thousand people to the pandemic so far While Europe has not been doing well on the test of health management solidarity and cooperation in the crisis Greece is standing out with its small numbers of cases and pandemicrelated deaths compared to many other countries with the Athens administration gradually taking steps for normalization since the beginning of May The first coronavirus incident in Greece was seen on Feb 26 in Thessaloniki the second largest city in the country The date of the first death is March 12 When the Athens government declared curfews on March 27 two weeks after the first death the number of cases was 15 According to the figures provided by the World Health Organization WHO even as late as April 15 the 50th day of the epidemic in Greece the number of cases had reached 2192 and the number of deaths was only 102 while in Italy the number of cases was 41035 with 3407 deaths The Greek health system which had been seriously debilitated by the 10year economic crisis caused the question will Greece be the second Italy to be raised since the Athens administration had cut 43 in healthcare spending during the recession which lasted from 2009 to 2018 However despite its population of 11 million people the number of cases seen so far in Greece is 2900 and the number of those who have succumbed to the disease is around 170 To compare the number of cases detected in Belgium whose population of nearly 115 million is slightly bigger than that of Greece has exceeded 55 thousand and the number of deaths as of today is over 9300 Researchers and statisticians will probably note this period as one of the fewest deaths in the history of the country since the use of motor vehicles in Greece has also sharply decreased in this period Regarding this success we need to underline the decisive measures taken by the Greek government from the moment the crisis first emerged Athens response to crisis It is of great importance to make quick decisions in crises to implement these decisions in cooperation and coordination while using the communication channels correctly and informing the public quickly and transparently The panic mood that quickly sets in during crisis periods does not take long before turning into a negative multiplier effect if it is not evaluated soundly and managed properly While the number of cases detected in the country was only 10 at the end of February the government lost no time in halting all international land sea and airline travels in line with the advice of its scientific committee and imposed a 14day mandatory quarantine on those coming from abroad All kinds of education and tourism activities concerts festivals and religious ceremonies were suspended while restaurants theaters and museums which could cause the epidemic to spread in the country were closed As a result of these measures the first pandemicrelated death occurred on March 12 While many European countries closed their places of worship during this process the Greek government took a more moderate attitude in this regard Although collective rituals have all been postponed to later dates leaving churches open for individual prayers can be interpreted as being cognizant of the importance people attach to their religious feelings and seen as a motivational factor in combating the crisis The New Democracy government led by Prime Minister Kryiakos Mitsotakis who has been implementing strict measures in the regions where the cases are concentrated has imposed curfews and been supported even by the opposition Syriza party since March 23 This decision is remarkable in that it was one of the earliest curfews in Europe The Ministry of Health which has increased the intensive care bed capacity in the country by 70 in order to strengthen the health system since February has also announced that 3337 new healthcare personnel will be employed and more will be recruited after that In order to prevent a decrease in the purchasing power of the people after the crisis the government has announced a oneoff package of 800 euros per person in the private sector and 630 euros for freelance translators architects and engineers In the second oldest population in Europe while measures such as pensions and unemployment allowances paid leave for families whose children cannot go to school have been ensured social security and a number of tax payments have been delayed and the creation of a subsidy package for debt interest has been delayed for a short period of time The government is measures were reflected in public spending in April at 26 billion euros This amount is more than 70 times higher than last year is spending of around 35 million euros Looking at the general data the budget deficit in the first quarter of the year was 1138 billion euros while this amount reached 6 billion euros in the same period of 2020 The Greek people who have historically resisted measures introduced topdown still have difficulty in abiding by the smoking prohibitions introduced in the country many years ago have continued their habit of smoking in closed spaces for a long time largely listening to the calls Of course the global panic created by the pandemic should be added to the picture but also the famine experience of the country is elderly population during World War II and beyond and the increasing education levels among the younger generations thanks to the integration into the European Union Digital transformation and public opinion While many public services that usually generate long queues in the country have been moved online with a digital transformation similar to that of Estonia which realized the first cyber breakthrough of Europe calls were made to inform the public through both traditional and digital media urging them to stay home It can be said that these methods developed by the Ministry of Digital Governance for those who have to go out due to health reasons for animal care and for access to emergency services and medicine have facilitated the crisis management While the code numbers received through the 13033 SMS line regarding reasons for going out forms that can be filled and signed online allow citizens to meet their basic needs during curfews and on the other hand enable public authorities to follow the density of the streets in real time As in every country the use of digital surveillance technologies more frequently by governments in Greece is discussed with regards to privacy and individual freedoms as well as the risks in terms of personal data Although the collection of personal data in many areas especially in health and education causes controversy in terms of the purpose of use and transparency some also view the crisis as a technological opportunity for the development of infrastructures required for cyber defense and cloud systems It can be said that the efforts of the Greek government to control the epidemic quickly by prioritizing public health have also won the citizens general approval According to the surveys the rate of those who think that they have been properly informed about the coronavirus pandemic the main symptoms of the disease its spread and the risk groups is 87 It is seen that at the beginning of April when the crisis was at its most intense and the frequency of transmission of the disease was at its peak the Greek people supported the government is measures and crisis management by 82 while this rate was at the level of 75 in early May The others of the crisis Refugees Compared to the government is response to the crisis and the measures it has taken to address the pandemic by protecting its citizens the refugee policy implemented has been disappointing In March the Greek administration ignoring the humanitarian tragedy unfolding at its borders with ten thousand refugees trying to enter the country intervened very harshly in the large group of refugees and became the target of even the opposition Syriza Party due to the preventive measures it announced would be placed at the sea border One of the issues that should be emphasized is that Athens avoids moving refugees to the mainland and isolates them on the islands and nearly 50000 refugees in total remain vulnerable to the threat of epidemic Greek authorities who placed their camps on the islands of Lesbos and Rhodes under quarantine after the first incident especially the Ritsona refugee camp are also criticized for the inadequate number of tests spared for the refugees While many human rights organizations as well as the United Nations have reported limited access to clean water and hygiene in the camps Greece has not yet taken a remedial step in this regard With this reality in mind it would not be too much to state that Greece which prioritizes the security health and economic wellbeing of its citizens seems to regard the refugees as a group of metoikos slaves who could not participate in political and social life and did not even have the right to vote during the wellknown Ancient democracy of Athens It remains still unclear when the government which announced that it has stopped all asylum applications during the crisis will open the doors of the country and therefore of Europe to refugees The fact that the European Union does not pass any legislation that will prevent violations and uphold law of asylum against governments such as Greece is which considers refugees as nonexistent makes these countries insensitive to migration and while putting the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of other countries it also causes the values and human rights discourse of the Western world that it has advocated for decades to be questioned Opinions expressed in this article are the author is own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency Greece

13 years ago had left the country a long time ago despite his family saying a day earlier that he had died in Iranian custody Robert Levinson went missing on Iran is Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007 The case is another irritant in the already hostile relationship between Washington and Tehran Levinson is family said on March 25 it now believed Levinson died in Iranian custody based on information from US officials Today with aching hearts we are sharing devastating news about Robert Levinson the head of our family they said in a statement However Iran is foreign ministry spokesman said on March 26 that based on what he called credible evidence Levinson had left Iran years ago for an unspecified destination In the past years Iran has tried to find out his state but could not find any signs of him being alive spokesman Abbas Mousavi said according to state television Reuters reported in 2013 that Levinson a private detective and former FBI agent was investigating allegations of corruption by wellconnected people in Iran Lawyer David McGee said then that Levinson was trying to trace money laundered through Iranian exiles living in Toronto US officials had acknowledged to Reuters that Levinson had a relationship with the CIA as a source at the time he visited Kish Island and disappeared A video released in 2011 showed him pleading for help It did not say who was holding him or where Tehran denied knowledge of Levinson is whereabouts last November when it said a legal case involving him was under way at a revolutionary court that handles securityrelated cases Iran has always maintained that its officials have no knowledge of Mr Levinson is whereabouts and that he is not in Iranian custody Those facts have not changed the spokesman for Iran is mission at the United Nations Alireza Miryousefi said on March 26 US President Donald Trump said on March 25 he had not been told that Levinson was dead But White House national security adviser Robert OBrien said later that an investigation was still going on but we believe that Bob Levinson may have passed away some time ago Levinson is family said in their statement We recently received information from US officials that has led both them and us to conclude that our wonderful husband and father died while in Iranian Custody They said they did not know when or how he died but that it was before the coronavirus epidemic hit Iran Nor did they know if Levinson is body would ever be returned to them OBrien said Iran must provide a complete accounting of what happened to Levinson Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish in 2007 There he met with Daoud Salahuddin an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington Levinson then a private investigator was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family sources familiar with his work said The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinson is abduction though at the time of his disappearance a governmentaffiliated media outlet said he was in the hands of Iranian security forces Some US investigators at least until recently believed Levinson was still alive while officials at other US agencies believe he died some time perhaps years ago The United States and the Islamic Republic are longtime foes Washington opposes Tehran is influence in the Middle East and backs its regional rival Saudi Arabia They also support opposing sides in wars in Yemen and Syria Washington also maintains tough economic sanctions on Iran In 2018 Trump pulled the United States out of an international agreement which curbed Iran is nuclear programme Fresh sanctions The United States blacklisted five Iran and Iraqbased companies and 15 individuals on March 26 for supporting terrorist groups its third round of sanctions on Iranian targets in the last two weeks even as Tehran battles the coronavirus outbreak In a statement the US Treasury Department accused those targeted of supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps IRGC and its Quds Force elite foreign paramilitary and espionage arm and of transferring lethal aid to Iranbacked militias in Iraq such as Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl alHaq all of which Washington deems foreign terrorist organizations The Pentagon blamed Kataib Hezbollah for a March 11 rocket attack that killed one British and two US personnel in Iraq US officials say they plan to keep sanctioning Iran to try to force it to curb its nuclear missile and regional activities despite the coronavirus outbreak which has killed 2234 people in Iran Treasury accused those designated of malign activities including selling Iranian oil to Syria smuggling arms to Iraq and Yemen and backing Iraqi militias that attack US forces The sanctions freeze any of their USheld assets and generally bar Americans from dealing with them The five targeted companies are Madain Novin Traders and Reconstruction Organization of the Holy Shrines in Iraq both of which are based in Iran and Iraq Bahjat al Kawthar Company for Construction and Trading Ltd also known as Kosar Company and Al Khamael Maritime Services which are both based in Iraq and Middle East Saman Chemical Company which is based in Iran The action also blacklists 15 individuals who are associated with the companies or officials of the Quds Force and Kataib HezbollahIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the boycott of US sanctions though it was unclear if he was responding to the latest actions Does the US want a forever pandemic Moral imperative to stop observing the bully is sanctions he tweeted Humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions Washington reimposed on Tehran after President Donald Trump abandoned Iran is 2015 multilateral deal to limit its nuclear program However broader US sanctions deter many firms from humanitarian trade with Iran The United States and Switzerland this year finalized a Swiss channel to get humanitarian goods to Iran As of March 19 one transaction had been processed Separately Washington renewed a sanctions waiver letting Iraq import electricity from Iran but vowed to blacklist anyone who used it to help terrorist groups

crisis is a test for international cooperation While a general lack of solidarity at the outset of the pandemic alarmed many about the efficiency of existing multilateral structures there is a growing consensus that cooperation is key to cope with such global challenges both at the international or global and regional level Unfortunately international cooperation and multilateralism were under significant stress before the outbreak of COVID19 marked by unfair trade policies whether existing or newly emerging and a political discourse focusing on building walls between countries people and cultures Now everybody wakes up to the fact that borders and fences may be infiltrated by an invisible enemy the virus And the challenges it presents to global health and economic systems call for a coordinated response and a multilateral solution Interestingly regional organizations were among the first to ensure the level of multilateral coordination needed to fight against the pandemic and to recover from the crisis as exemplified by the demonstration of solidarity in the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States Turkic Council as a prompt and strong response to the pandemic The Turkic Council counts five Member States Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Turkey and Uzbekistan and the Observer State Hungary while closely engaging with Turkmenistan on different levels Unlike many regional initiatives whose formation was closely associated with reconciliation and stabilization efforts in postconflict areas the establishment of the Turkic Council was inspired by historical brotherhood ties common language culture and traditions in the Turkic space The goal of an initial rapprochement has long been surpassed by strengthened economic political and technical cooperation among its Member States presently applying to government private academia and NGO sectors as well as international partners such as the UN the Organization of Islamic Cooperation OIC and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE Following the COVID19 outbreak the Turkic Council member countries moved fast in providing necessary medical supply and food support to each other at a bilateral level including by organizing a virtual emergency summit of the Heads of States with the participation of the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization WHO Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Following the summit cooperation efforts among Turkic Council countries have gained new momentum in the area of health transport economy trade customs and migration under the auspices of the Istanbulbased Turkic Council Secretariat In the area of health our countries decided to launch systematic cooperation for prevention diagnosis and treatment of other dangerous infections in the future including by the establishment of a new Health Coordination Committee which will focus on improving practices of healthcare professionals and developing wellequipped hospitalsTransport Ministers also agreed on coordinating the uninterrupted flow of food medical products and humanitarian aid to maintain supply chains including by the launch of a green corridor an international fasttrack transport line for essential goods In this context additional transit permits and driver visas were issued while transitpass fees were reduced in particular along the TransCaspian Corridor Meanwhile Turkic Council Economy Ministers have decided to review import taxes in view of maintaining contactless trade while upgrading digital trade solutions and ecommerce as a crisis response Further commitments were made to establish joint industrial zones technoparks and trade houses The establishment of a Turkic Investment Fund was also on the agenda which will serve as an important financial tool to boost intraregional trade Last but not least the Turkic Council countries have decided to establish a Migration Coordination Group as they agreed to mutually facilitate the issuance of visas and residence permits for citizens who were strained in other Member States territories after the closure of borders While these efforts are expected to yield positive results in the fight against the pandemic no one will have lasting peace until the virus is completely eradicated across the world Considering the economic consequences of COVID19 international partnerships will be also crucial for bringing back economic growth and creating jobs for our citizens Intergovernmental organizations such as the Turkic Council will also have a role to play to achieve longterm recovery For our young Secretariat which was mandated in Nakhchivan 11 years ago the most important lesson learnt from this pandemic is the fact that in such grave crisis circumstances mutual help and support that our member states can provide each other are not only welcome but are actually the first to come The challenges ahead are pushing towards greater regional economic integration while improving the connectivity and competitiveness of our economies This will not happen overnight but vision determination and courage are existing and important components for that mission or sacred

catastrophes in the country The UN has urged all actors involved in wars to end their hostilities in order to help the world contain Covid19 coronavirus Last month UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres called for a global ceasefire in all corners of the worldto put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives Yet as Covid19 spreads violent conflicts in the Arab world continue Several civil wars across the Middle East and North Africa MENA will make it extremely difficult for the region to deal with this pandemic Yemen is probably the Arab state most vulnerable to coronavirus Even without the conflict the Arab regions poorest country would be far from having adequate resources to cope with Covid19 With destroyed infrastructure a nearly collapsed health care system widespread malnourishment two million cholera cases crowded refugee camps and more than five years of warfare one could only imagine how much coronavirus could exacerbate Yemens humanitarian crises The World Health Organization WHO warned of a perfect storm of a disaster should this virus introduce itself to Yemen Unfortunately the recent escalation of violence in the conflict highlights how the parties have not accepted SecretaryGeneral Guterres demand for a global ceasefire at least not for too long To the contrary late last month the Saudiled coalition carried out air strikes on parts of Houthicontrolled northern Yemen The coalitions attacks followed the interception of ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and southern Saudi Arabia The Houthi attacks against the Kingdom came on the fiveyearanniversary of Saudi Arabias direct military intervention against the Houthi rebels who usurped control of Sanaa in September 2014 Although as of writing there have been no documented cases of coronavirus in Yemen this pandemic could make the countrys humanitarian disasters even more catastrophic should it hit the country Nonetheless it is important to recognise that Covid19 is also an opportunity for the various actors in Yemens conflict to make concessions in a facesaving way in the interest bringing peace to the wartorn country Although a ceasefire would not immediately resolve the underlying causes of the Yemeni civil war it is a necessary first step Without a truce that can quickly go into effect Yemen will be awaiting a looming crisis that threatens to unleash a whole new wave of widespread death and misery across the country five years after the Saudis and Emiratis launched Operation Decisive Storm Under the pretext of protecting Yemen from Covid19 the leaders of the various sides fighting in Yemen could prioritise the safety and health of Yemenis above their own political agendas If ever there were a time for such a shift in priorities it would be now But a danger for Yemen is that the main players might conclude that more is to be gained than lost from continued warfare The Houthis have made gains on the ground throughout the past several months underscoring their real strength Their recent firing of ballistic missiles at Riyadh was a powerful reminder that the Iranianbacked rebels are capable of threatening the Kingdoms security with their arsenal of drones and missiles That the Saudis are going back to Oman as a backchannel between Riyadh and the Houthis likely says much about the Saudi leaderships continued interest in winding down the war in Yemen through a negotiated settlement Yet how much the Houthis will give up to the Saudis and Yemens internationally recognised government while the Tehransponsored insurgents are in a position of strength is unclear Yemens looming Covid19 crisis is also playing out in relation to the conflict between the countrys UNrecognised administration and the United Arab Emirates UAEbacked Southern Transitional Council STC In order to weaken Preident Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadis government individuals tied to the STC have been reportedly withholding equipment that the WHO sent to Yemen At the same time in Yemen there is information warfare surrounding Covid19 For example certain Houthi figures are accusing the US of being behind this pandemic while using their media outlets to sell a message about the Islamic Republic successfully taking care of the disease despite Washingtons maximum pressure Mohammed al Houthi a prominent Houthi militia leader accused the Saudi authorities of one of the greatest sins after they temporarily closed the Grand Mosque in Mecca to help contain the spread of coronavirus a move which he later said illustrated Saudi Arabias move toward secularism For Yemenis humanitarian crises and pandemics are not new They have been experiencing them throughout the past five years Tragically the health and security of Yemenis have never been priorities for the major political actors involved in the countrys multisided conflict The blocking of humanitarian aid for political purposes bombing of hospitals and many more egregious acts have resulted in millions of Yemenis paying the price for this nightmarish conflict continuing Indeed it is terrifying to consider how much coronavirus could worsen Yemens ongoing catastrophes We welcome all pitches

coronavirus threatens to become a catastrophic disaster in Yemen according to an official with the World Health Organization WHO The health system here is already fragile Should the virus become fully transmissible in Yemen it will be catastrophic in the country Altaf Musani the WHO Representative and mission chief in Yemen told Anadolu Agency in an exclusive interview on the latest developments about the virus is spread in the Middle Eastern country Noting that though the country is health system was starting efforts to prepare for a response to the pandemic Musani warned that it would never be fully prepared as it had experienced conflict within its borders for the past five years This health system will never be fully prepared because we have had five years of war and that conflict that vulnerability and that fragility has really weakened the health system to deal with routine health matters such as cholera dengue and malaria Musani said he was deeply worried should the country find itself facing coronavirus cases since the health system would not be able to manage the outbreak Earlier this week the Yemeni authorities have confirmed eight COVID19 death cases and 51 cases in areas under its control Half of the fatalities and 35 infections were reported in the temporary capital city of Aden alone Although the first infection case was declared on April 10 in the southern Hadramaut province of Yemen Musani said the particular patient has recovered which was announced on April 13 by the government but noted that there have been subsequent additional five cases declared by the authorities in Aden Musani underlined that the WHO was dealing with both of two different authorities in the country adding that they were providing capacity to both We have a situation where we deal with two different authorities the internationally recognized government and Aden as well as the de facto authorities in Sanaa We have provided capacity to both these entities to make sure that they can test for the virus trace for the virus of course isolate and treat he said Yemen has been beset by violence and chaos since 2014 when Houthi rebels overran much of the country including Sanaa The crisis escalated in 2015 when a Saudiled military coalition launched a devastating air campaign aimed at rolling back Houthi territorial gains Since then tens of thousands of Yemenis including numerous civilians are believed to have been killed in the conflict while another 14 million are at risk of starvation according to the UN Testing facilities Musani said that testing was available in the city of of Sanaa under the Houthis control while in the south testing was carried out in Aden AlMukalla and Taiz He said WHO was making efforts to support the country is health authorities to launch an additional lab in the southern city of Seiyun and hoping to have testing capability in the coastal province of AlHudaydah So that would make six central public health laboratories nationwide that would be capacitated to have the necessary means to run the PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction samples he said adding that those six would be further expanded based on the availability of tests Testing for COVID19 requires rapid response teams Musani said noting that such teams had been deployed at almost every district of Yemen due to a cholera outbreak two years ago These rapid response teams have been further trained and will continue to scale up They can do the screening at the points of entry they can do investigation of rumors and then the third and the most important thing they do is they take samples of suspect cases He explained that after a sample or swab is taken from the interior of a patient is nose or the back of their throat it is transported to one of the six labs across the country Test results are reported to the country is Ministry of Public Health which then reports the figures to WHO as members states are legally required to report any public health emergency of international concern to the organization WHO in turn provides the public health advice as well as some material operational support he said We help them with PPE personal protective equipment we help them with tests we help them with swabs we help them with PCR machines And then of course we provide some financial support based on what donors have provided us from COVID19 response COVID19 specialized hospitals The WHO official said that Yemeni health authorities specially equipped 38 out of a total of 369 hospitals to fight against the COVID19 pandemic with special intensive care units oxygen therapy ventilators clinical experts barrier materials to manage severe and critical cases WHO has shared necessary operational materials with 32 out of the 38 hospitals Musani said adding that only 14 of these were functional He emphasized that the organization was still working with authorities to make sure that the remaining facilities were fully functional Functionality criteria include whether a facility is staff had the right training whether it had the right workforce and required equipment as well as whether the community was aware of these facilities Stop blaming WHO Musani urged the public to stop blaming WHO for the ongoing pandemic which has killed more than 290000 people so far out of over 42 million who have been infected They must stop attacking and laying blame on the WHO The WHO is not a government but WHO is here as a provider of last resort WHO is here as the technical agency to provide the health authorities with the evidence with the information with the material support in order for the authorities to manage the outbreak he said Musani urged the public to protect the health authorities and defend their humanitarian work Last month US President Donald Trump said he would suspend the country is funding for WHO accusing the UN agency of mismanaging and covering up the outbreak due to Chinese pressure USChinese relations have deteriorated dramatically since Trump is accusations and branding of COVID19 the Chinese virus a move his critics say smacks of racism Insufficient test numbers Based on models that have been developed worldwide and for Yemen the number of tests that would be required are millions we do not have those tests The amount of PPE personal protective equipment that would be required is millions We do not have that kind of PPE and the type and number of hospitals that may have admissions are in the hundreds of thousands he explained Musani emphasized that so far 10 of hospitals worldwide have been dedicated to combating the coronavirus pandemic We are deeply worried that the amount of PPE testing kits labs healthcare workforce are grossly insufficient in Yemen to manage the outbreak at peak The Yemeni government on Sunday appealed for help from the international community to combat the spread of the pandemic On Monday the government declared the temporary capital Aden as a disaster zone due to the spread of the coronavirus and other epidemics according to local media Since appearing in Wuhan China last December the novel coronavirus has spread to at

impact on the most vulnerable communities of the world According to a recent World Bank report the Middle East and North Africa MENA region is ranked as secondlowest among all regions in the overall Global Health Security Index and it comes last in terms of both epidemiology workforce and emergency preparedness and response planning Without an effective and coordinated set of policies to achieve a swift economic recovery the region is highly likely to suffer from greater political instabilities and become a breeding ground for terror groups The COVID19 outbreak has exacerbated these preexisting vulnerabilities and risks in the widelymismanaged economies of the MENA where medical systems are underresourced and muchneeded infrastructure either destroyed or lacking A range of harsh antiCOVID19 measures such as selfisolation social distancing and lockdowns including total curfews and international travel restrictions have been implemented by governments to control the spread of the virus and protect lives These preventive measures however led economies across the region to experience severe supply and demand shocks The most recent regional economic outlook reports published by both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF forecast that regional economies would most likely experience a sharp economic fallout by 42 percent and 47 percent in 2020 respectively Still the real sociopolitical and economic impact of the COVID19 pandemic in the MENA remains highly uncertain and will strictly depend on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy responses developed by each nation The current predictions however suggest that all critical macroeconomic indicators such as fiscal and current account balances foreign reserves and the inflow of foreign direct investment will be distressed as a result of the crisis The pandemicinduced crisis is expected to exacerbate poverty deepen inequality and constrain households access to basic needs including health services The economic repercussions of the COVID19 pandemic effectively forced almost all countries in the region to request financial assistance from the IMF or other financial institutions to strengthen their economic position and prevent the possibility of a prolonged economic recession As a result regional economies have become heavily dependent on the reform directions of the IMF World Bank and other investment banks Socioeconomic and political tensions remain a distinct possibility in the postpandemic era if policy responses fail to meet the demands of the majority and set a path for swift economic recovery Countries such as Lebanon Jordan Palestine Egypt and Tunisia already have debilitated capabilities Persisting sociopolitical and economic hardship exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic may lead to a vicious cycle of economic malaise The same outcome applies to the only two oilexporting countries of the region Iraq and Algeria Their economies were hit by the complete halt of economic activities due to the pandemic and have also been severely affected by the crash of oil prices A similar assessment is applicable to wartorn countries of the region Syria and Libya too Though their economic outlook is linked to a sustainable political order and strong security environment the spread of the virus and its humanitarian and economic costs are extra burdens on the wellbeing of communities living in these countries The only countries in the region with a relatively positive sociopolitical and financial outlook are Israel and Morocco While their economies are experiencing the economic consequences of the pandemic their macroeconomic variables are in a better position compared to their peers Their public and externals debts are relatively lower in comparison to other nations in the region Nevertheless every country will experience the heavy burden of issues such as collapsing global trade low commodity prices major capital outflows and healthcarespecific challenges inflicted by the COVID19 outbreak The crisis is dealing a heavy blow on sectors such as tourism export companies and small and mediumsized businesses which employ the largest share of the workforce and generate a considerable share of the revenue streams for the region is economic development A reduction in income from these sectors as well as remittances and foreign investment from the oilrich Gulf countries subsequently hampered the foreign reserves and deepened the current account deficit across the region as a whole Against this challenging backdrop a range of economic recovery packages have been announced by the governments to mitigate the economic repercussions of the COVID19 The majority of them are aimed at helping the most hardhit sectors and communities through temporary tax relief cash transfers or cheap financing The uncertainty about the real economic impact of the pandemic however has complicated the policy response Many of these economies have limited fiscal and external debt capacities The Lebanese government for instance has the highest external debt in the region with approximately 170 percent of its GDP Jordan Tunisia Egypt and Iraq follow Lebanon with external debts of 97 90 872 and 80 percent of their GDP respectively Ultimately many of these economies had already been battling with high poverty political instability and poor healthcare infrastructure hence the historic economic downturn provoked by the novel coronavirus will aggravate existing economic and humanitarian challenges The region already has the world is highest youth unemployment and it hosts countries that have weak security institutions In the period that lies ahead if the geostrategic vulnerabilities and risks continue to amplify across the region without a stable political leadership effective civil service and a welltargeted set of economic recovery programs the region will likely experience a prolonged economic recession and an increased risk of social unrest The writer is a researcher at the TRT World Research Centre He holds a PhD in International Political Economy from King is College London and

Arabia is official state news agency a Saudi military spokesman Col Turki al Malki said that the ceasefire would last two weeks and that it comes in response to UN calls to halt hostilities amid the coronavirus pandemic He said the ceasefire could be extended to pave the way for the parties to discuss proposals steps and mechanisms for sustainable ceasefire in Yemen for a comprehensive political solution in Yemen There was no immediate reaction from Houthi leaders or Yemen is internationally recognised government to the coalition is statement UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres who called for a ceasefire in all global conflicts on March 23 to tackle the virus welcomed the announcement saying This can help to advance efforts towards peace as well as the countrys response to the Covid19 pandemic He called on Yemens government which is backed by the Saudiled coalition and the Houthis to follow through on their commitment to immediately cease hostilities and to engage with each other without preconditions in negotiations facilitated by UN envoy Martin Griffiths Only through dialogue will the parties be able to agree on a mechanism for sustaining a nationwide ceasefire humanitarian

officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media while the tribal leaders did want to be quoted by name out of fear of reprisals The flareup in fighting came at a time Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile targeted at their capital Riyadh late last month The Houthis frequently launch missiles across Yemens border into Saudi Arabia but it is rare that they reach the capital The war has proved costly for Saudi Arabia and has damaged its image abroad The calls for peace come amid a trying time The country is engaged in an international price war over the cost of oil having pushed its production higher to try to take back market share from Russia and the United States International rights groups criticised Saudi Arabia over the conflict and the

Nationsled initiative to end the war In a statement the UN special envoy for Yemen welcomed the coalition is announcement saying it comes at a critical moment for Yemen The parties must now utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace Griffiths said Yemen the Arab worlds poorest nation has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 That is when the Iranianbacked Houthis took control of the countrys north including the capital of Sanaa The Saudiled military coalition intervened against the Houthis the following year conducting relentless airstrikes and a blockade of Yemen Past attempts at ending the conflict have stalled A 2018 peace agreement brokered by the UN in Sweden led to a rough road map to end fighting in the key port city of Hodeida but brought little actual progress The talks proposed by al Malki would be the first facetoface negotiations since the war started In addition to representatives from the Houthis and Yemens internationally recognized government al Malki said a Saudi military team would also be present The conflict has killed over 100000 people and created the worlds worst humanitarian crisis leaving millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and pushing the country to the brink of famine Authorities in Yemen have yet to announce a confirmed case of the coronavirus but experts fear the virus could eventually prove deadly there after the years of devastation by the war

Covid19 in crowded living spaces The fate of more than one million Rohingya genocide survivors has never looked so grim in the three years since they fled their villages for the safety of the Bangladeshi border When summarising the plight of the Rohingya survivor becomes the operative word given their ongoing physical and psychological injuries with most having witnessed their homes destroyed mass killings and their wives mothers and daughters raped many whom were later burnt alive or hacked to death Around 13 million Rohingya Muslims cling to life within a small patch of territory in Myanmar is Rakhine State and a narrow corridor of land along the TeknafCox is Bazaar highway They have been rendered stateless with no security or fundamental human rights and have been discarded by the international community In the past month however their situation has moved from dire to catastrophic It is likely the next great Rohingya tragedy is around the corner Rohingya refugees are not only stalked by the Covid19 pandemic but they are also being turned away from Muslim majority countries Malaysia and Bangladesh threatened with deportation from India and increasingly shelled by the Myanmar military in Rakhine State The United Nations has said 32 mostly Rohingya women and children were killed by the Myanmar military in Rakhine and Chin provinces during March Myanmar denies the deliberate targeting of civilians arguing it shells only the Arakan Army militants a Buddhist separatist group but eyewitnesses and human rights activists have refuted its claims with a trove of evidence The Myanmar military have operated from the same brutal playbook for decades says Tirana Hassan Amnesty International is Director of Crisis Response Despite international condemnation over the Myanmar military is atrocities all evidence suggests that they are brazenly committing yet more serious abuses When I spoke with Mohammed Salam chairman of a local Rohingya welfare committee in Rakhine State for TRT World last year he described to me how a Myanmar military gunship attacked a Rohingya village in the township of Buthidaung A half dozen were killed and the injured were taken to the hospital in Buthidaung which is running out of medicines and anaesthesia he said We are trapped in a genocide zone given Myanmar is security forces have effectively ringfenced more than 200000 Rohingya in the northwestern corner of the country The civilian death toll mounts with a 15yearold Rohingya boy killed when the Myanmar military shelled his village on Wednesday and a young man in his early twenties murdered when 20 soldiers entered the village of Minbya on Thursday evening The international community had promised the establishment of safe zones but nothing has materialised The Myanmar military has since escalated artillery attacks on Arakan Army positions and Rohingya villages that have sparked another exodus and several civilian casualties Last week the Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard denied two boats carrying approximately 500 Rohingya from entering Bangladeshi waters after the country is foreign minister Dr Momen declared No more Rohingya will be allowed in On April 16 Malaysian authorities intercepted a boat carrying 396 refugees which had been adrift for weeks resulting in an estimated 60 deaths at sea We held on board their funeral prayers and dropped their bodies in the sea one survivor told AFP Compounding their misery Malaysian authorities prevented the boat from entering Malaysian territorial waters after false rumours spread through the country that refugees were infected with Covid19 That said the Covid19 virus is yet to strike the Rohingya in Bangladesh but if or more likely when it does the outcome will be predictably disastrous given every square mile of the refugee camps is home to 100000 refugees who are essentially crammed together like sardines thus making social distancing and quarantine measures virtually impossible We need emergency support We are very worried the NGO groups here do not have facemasks or hand sanitizer No one test positive to diseases yet but it will be very bad when someone does Satar Islam Nitob a Rohingya refugee at Kutapalong camp told me over the phone last week Some including Azeem Ibrahim author of The Rohingyas Inside Myanmar is Hidden Genocide have estimated upwards of 200000 Rohingya could be killed by Covid19 due to overcrowded living conditions and limited access to medical supplies In the bestcase scenarios scientists believe that the disease could have a mortality rate as low as under 1 percentIn conditions such as those in Cox is Bazar mortality rates could easily reach 20 percentWe are talking 200000 people An order of magnitude more than those killed by the Myanmar military writes Ibrahim Adding to their woes is the fact the Bangladesh government has shut down Internet access in the camps which according to Human Rights Watch is obstructing humanitarian groups from addressing Covid19 Authorities should lift the internet shutdown which is obstructing crucial information about symptoms and prevention or end up risking the lives of refugees host communities and healthcare workers says Brad Adams Human Rights Watch Asia Director No doubt the entire planet is locked in a battle against the global pandemic but that does not absolve the international community particularly the United Nations ASEAN or Organization of Islamic Cooperation member states of its responsibility to resolve this ongoing humanitarian crisis Far too

Austria July 14 2015 REUTERS File Photo The Iranian people are suffering under US sanctions at the time when the novel coronavirus caused damage to their country and these sanctions put a lot of obstacles for Irans struggle against COVID19 particularly in acquiring drugs and medical equipment Irans Ambassador to Ankara Mohammed Farazmand has told the Hürriyet Daily News Calling on the international community to put pressure on the Trump Administration to change its attitude the ambassador also expressed gratitude to Turkey for the medical aid they sent When was the first COVID19 case was detected in Iran What is the current situation of the pandemic in your country The first confirmed cases of COVID19 in Iran were reported on Feb 19 in Qom On the same day despite the fact that the country was on the verge of holding important elections of the parliament the virus outbreak was announced in a transparent manner to the public in order to protect public health On March 29 2020 the total number of infections in Iran rose to 38309 Almost 9000 people infected by the coronavirus have so far recovered and discharged from hospitals Sadly COVID19 has taken the lives of 2640 people in my country so far But on the other hand a great number of people diagnosed with COVID19 have been discharged from ICU wards and the number of entry of coronavirus patients to hospitals has registered a significant decline What are the measures your government has taken so far What is the main approach your government has adopted Within the framework of the World Health Organization WHO guidelines and in compliance with International Health Standards Iran has provided their facilities and resources to cope with the epidemic Iran due to this responsibility has provided all information to the relevant international institutions and invited experts from the WHO to visit and analyze our health facilities and to provide Iran with the necessary advice and experiences Iranian scientists have begun the process of developing a compound drug Fortunately the early test of this drug has been successful and we hope that it will be operational in the coming days Along with civil facilities we have provided all army hospitals with required medical equipment and the Army Ground Force constructed an equipped 2000bed hospital within 48 hours The government has made numerous decisions such as closing down public centers schools and universities postponing events providing the basic needs of the population teleworking of staff disinfection of the urban facilities etc A great number of prisoners have been released on leave in cooperation with the Judiciary Branch across the country As all other countries staying at home is essential and this issue should be taken into serious consideration What are the strengths and weaknesses of your approach When do you think would this outbreak be taken under control and be defeated in Iran While the virus devastates the cities and towns our nation suffers under the most severe and indiscriminate campaign of economic terrorism in history imposed illegally and extraterritorially by the US These sanctions have affected the legal trade of the medicine medical equipment and humanitarian supplies and have posed serious obstacles to the efforts to battle against COVID19 in Iran It is very necessary and urgent that all governments and nations urge and put pressure for an immediate end to the US governments economic terrorism against people of Iran Is your government in cooperation with other nations in fighting the coronavirus It is indispensable that all countries in the world stand together free from political and geographical differences Iranian people appreciate the growing global campaign of governments civil society leaders calling for the lifting of illegal US sanctions A great number of world leaders including Turkey China Pakistan Russia Lebanon the UN and the EU have called for the lifting of US sanctions against Iran Do you have any kind of cooperation with Turkey as part of the struggle against COVID19 We appreciate the Turkish government for donating a consignment of healthcare medical aid to Iran By the order of the Turkish government all land and air borders between the two countries were closed Because of this there were problems for Iranian and Turkish trucks trying to return However with the cooperation and followup of many Turkish trucks they entered Iran from Central Asia and headed for Turkey Also Iranian trucks that were in Turkey or in European countries Lebanon Georgia and Ukraine returned to Iran through Turkish territory Unfortunately the process of bilateral trade has slowed down and the two sides are trying to establish a way for the continuation of trade between the two countries Do you receive sufficient support from other countries and the rest of the international society in Irans struggle against COVID19 In this crisis as Iran came alongside the affected countries especially China many countries supported the Iranian people in different ways Of course the US sanctions have created serious problems for sending medical equipment and supplies to confront the coronavirus so the inhumane policy of imposing unilateral sanctions which are crimes against humanity

countries the world over as they have been forced to adopt new measures to ensure not only the health and safety of their citizens but also the sustainability of organizational structures The positive or negative lessons learned from the pandemic offer valuable experience for future crises and how they should improve state capacity In an exclusive interview with Anadolu Agency Prof Dr Haluk Alkan from the political science and international relations department at Istanbul University discussed the state structure and its capacity the importance of leadership and the role of international organizations amid the virus outbreak Alkan said governments while dealing with the outbreak had difficulty mobilizing their full capacity including in fields such as health services production supply chains and security leading to their adoption of different approaches some of which were hailed as a success and some viewed as a failure States are now in need of a revision to increase their existing capacity regarding organizational institutional financial and personal aspects against crises at a global level he said adding it was possible for governments to adopt a more flexible organizational model to empower their organizational status According to the academician the concept of political leadership is yet another area that will be significantly affected due to the spread of the disease Arguing that populist leaders gained public attention by tapping into the discontent within society and their criticism of the current status quo along with power relations he went on to say that such leaders were not really that effective in bringing an organizational solution to the grievances they complained about to come to power Among them are the leaders for instance who first backed the idea of herd immunity Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is a really good example The lack of state capacity is the main reason behind prioritizing the populist discourse and the strategy of sticking to the herd immunity in Brazil although many other countries abandoned it he said A similar situation also exists in authoritarian countries weak in terms of state capacity It is attentiongrabbing that countries such as North Korea have not reported any cases or announced only a few Leaders who are capable of balancing democratic institutions and state capacity remain sensitive to democratic legitimacy and accountability and gain public trust while keeping communication channels open and use state capacity in a flexible way are likely to get more attention in the postvirus period according to Alkan The virus crisis especially in its early phase caused the international community to question the reliability of regional and international alliances as well One of the finest examples of this was visible in the Europe where influential countries were busy confiscating medical equipment from one another The European Union the best example of integration failed at establishing a cooperation mechanism with member countries to combat the outbreak The member countries that should have taken more responsibility became introverted and both Italy and Spain were left alone he said adding member countries with smaller populations also went through hard times On the other hand other countries such as Russia and China which provided medical aid sought to use this internal European crisis as leverage to increase their acceptance and influence in the international community by sharing their state capacity to combat the virus he said He said Turkey which extended a helping hand to 138 countries followed solidaritybased foreign policy amid the pandemic and became part of international efforts to combat the outbreak Along with capacitysharing Turkey also contributed to the process by becoming part of treatment and vaccination efforts and offering medical devices he said The pandemic once again proved that states should have selfsufficiency to some extent to be able deal with global crises given that they might find themselves all alone as countries might prioritize their own grievances over others Alkan said many global companies had previously built factories in foreign countries due to advantages such as low costs and taxes but home countries now could ask such companies to invest at home more so they could tackle largescale crises such as the pandemic in an easier fashion US President Donald Trump had already initiated this The COVID19 outbreak might make this approach more popular After all the disruptions in the global supply chain make states obliged to turn their faces to their own neighborhoods he said He further noted that the measures adopted as part of efforts against the outbreak were likely to adversely affect many sectors in the coming days including transportation tourism services and education Therefore the states would have additional burdens on their shoulders As for the financial dimension of the crisis he said the states were now in a position to reshape their approach towards the economy and humanitarian values adding they should take more responsibilities and question the ongoing economic trend where nonstate actors had been becoming more dominant since the 1980s Since first appearing in Wuhan China last December the novel coronavirus has spread to at least 188 countries and regions The US Brazil

opposition to the violence in Myanmar and his support to the Rohingya population said the Burmese military was taking advantage of strategic rivalry between China and India and blamed genocide of Rohingya to an institutional hate campaign Born in a Burmese Buddhist family Zarni said a campaign of ignorance was manufactured in his country through schools mass media and Buddhist organizations against Rohingya which eventually culminated in the genocide The Burmese public has been made ignorant of the facts about Islam and Muslims said Zarni in an exclusive interaction with Anadolu Agency Cofounder of the Free Rohingya Coalition and the Forces of Renewal Southeast Asia the UKbased scholar said there was no reason for the Burmese government to target Rohingya as they do not demand secession independence or even a regional autonomy Rohingya are not fighting with any community or with the government They want to live in Burma as peacefully as anybody he said He said it is Rakhine Buddhists who are fighting the central government of ethnic Burmese to reclaim their sovereignty they have lost 200 years ago Zarin said the Rohingya have become sandwiched between the two waring Buddhist parties That is the only conflict there he said adding that the world does not know these facts about Myanmar and tends to focus on Muslims versus the Buddhist paradigm The activist further said that the Burmese military was also taking advantage of strategic rivalry between China and India in the region The multibilliondollar projects along the Arakan the coastline or like giving the mineral rights concessions or gas exploration rights you will see a pattern of the Burmese military making sure both India and China received something In other words while they are playing India and China against each other to maintain the benefits of being allies with both powers he said Fear and hate are rooted in ignorance Anadolu Agency As an activist who has been at the forefront against racial discrimination how you view the present uprising against the brutal killing of George Floyd and its linkage with white supremacy in the US the UK and with the old European colonialism And is there also a paradox with socalled European values of human rights Maung Zarni MZ It triggered what you call uprising But I think it is more than an uprising as it triggered a new global consciousness among nonblack people that something is fundamentally wrong and needs to be changed White supremacy or what racism is not about the skin color of white people It is about devastatingly harmful ideology about institutions histories and structures and practices of discrimination exploitation looting and land grab The transAtlantic slave trade went on for 350 years All the leading European countries France Britain Portugal Spain the Netherlands who are champions of human rights and liberalism today were in the slave trade in the US Caribbean and Brazil These leading European powers looted Africa of its most precious resources That is not diamonds gold or copper but its humans We today witness the lootings in New York and other places and feel uncomfortable Leading European nations looted Africa of its humans making them commodities chained in the basement of ships The slave trading was endorsed by the Catholic Church and the rulers of Europe The wealth of Europe all the beautiful cities of Europe Paris Amsterdam Prague were built on the corpses and labor of nonEuropean people Therefore what we are seeing today and the destruction of statues of slave traders goes beyond police brutality Q Hate leads to racism and that leads to exclusion which in turn has led to genocide quite often in history Rohingya have experienced this all How much is this phenomenon interlinked to global events happening in Israel where Palestinians find their backs against the wall What leads to one community to feel it is superior to others like whites in the West Jews in Israel Colonial powers no longer exist but why the colonial mindset is still alive and kicking Who feeds it MZ I think fear and hatred are rooted in ignorance Ignorance is not something that comes naturally It is taught in school promoted by demagogic politicians propagated by religious leaders and amplified by mass media So these institutions are involved in making public ignorant I am a Burmese Buddhist from Myanmar I lived there We were made ignorant of the fact that Rohingya belong to Burma Burmese Buddhists susceptible to the propaganda of the Burmese military since the 1960s have been made to believe that they do not want Muslim Burmese whether they are Rohingya ethnic or Gujarati or others who may have migrated to Burma centuries ago The Burmese military systematically engaged in propagating Islamophobia Muslims are bad and evil and Islam is invasive and a conquering ideology And they will destroy a Buddhist country and Buddha is way of life Therefore we the Burmese public has been made ignorant of the facts about Islam and Muslims Muslims want peace as much as any other Christian or Buddhist or Hindu Because of this manufactured ignorance Burmese think to get rid of the Rohingya and discriminate and persecute other Muslims There are also economic gains that accrue in the Rohingya genocide Every genocide benefits the killers the perpetrators If you look at Nazi Germany when the Nazis massexterminated the German Jews everything that belonged to the victims was confiscated by the killers land building treasures of all kinds including jewelry gold art objects even shoes Likewise the Burmese military and the political state took the abandoned land warehouses paddy undestroyed buildings etc Rohingya not fighting with government or any community Q Out of 14 provinces in Myanmar 11 are embroiled in some or other forms of strife Rakhine is the only province where the conflict has attained communal proportions Why is it so MZ Concerning the Rohingya there is no conflict Because genocides are no conflicts Rohingya are not fighting with any community or with the government Rohingya wants to live in Burma as peacefully as anybody They even do not demand independence or regional autonomy only basic rights civil rights and equal citizenship which they had lost at the hands of the Burmese state So the conflict in Rakhine is actually between Rakhine Buddhists who lost their old kingdom 200 years ago and the Burmese Buddhists who rule the center That is the only conflict there Rakhine Buddhists are fighting through armed struggle against the Burmese Buddhists Q This is something news But the question is why the world does not know that there are other armed resistance movements and conflicts in Myanmar MZ Because the western media wants to focus on Muslims versus the Buddhist paradigm They want to use this narrative of religious conflict or the clash of civilization if you want which fits the larger Islamophobia which seeps through western media being that whenever there is Islam there is a war conflict and suicide bombing But in the case of Burma in the case of Rohingya the violence is perpetrated not by the Muslims but by the Burmese military and Buddhist majority Q Almost onequarter of Myanmar hosts one or more ethnic armed organizations EAOs and most of them practice Buddhism Why does the central government is axe only fall on Rohingya in Rakhine state MZ Rakhine has a triangular colonial situation On one hand Rohingya Muslims share the Rakhine region as coresidents with Rakhine Buddhists The entire coastline of the ancient Arakan kingdom is a colony of the Burmese Buddhists The Rohingya have got sandwiched between the Burmese Buddhists at the center and Rakhine Buddhists The center has made sure that these regional Muslims and Buddhist communities remain divided So this is a classic colonial policy by the Burmese Buddhist and the military against two communities who are equally colonized by the Burmese Therefore this horizontal or communal conflict in Rakhine has been actively fanned from the colonial Burmese center Just about every single ethnic community who has a the pocket of land that they call their ancestral land or region has taken up and revolted against the central ethnically Burmese control military or civilian the government since independence from Britain in 1948 The main reason for widespread armed ethnic rebellion or revolt against the central government in Burma is because of the violation of the principle of ethnic equality within what was promised to be a federation of different ethnic communities That is what triggered widespread ethnic armed rebellions in all nonBurmese regions And remember Burma is a multiethnic country with borders with about five different countries like big ones like China India or smaller ones like Bangladesh Thailand Laos All these borderland areas belong to ethnic minorities More importantly these borderlands are militarily strategic for the Burmese military And being used as buffers these regions are rich in teak agricultural land and above ground and underground minerals like gold titanium jade copper Rakhine coast region also has one of the 10th largest natural gas deposits in the world So there are economic elements and military elements that motivate the Burmese military to treat these ethnic communities as if they were colonies of the Burmese military and by extension colonies of the Burmese majority of people like myself Burmese military targets Rohingya Q But again the question is why they single out Rohingya if they have issues with other communities as well MZ There are two reasons Rohingya happen to be Muslims and are living next to one of the largest Muslim countries in the world Bangladesh And through the eyes of the Burmese military Bangladesh is a smaller country in landmass compared to Burma And yet Bangladesh is population is three times as many as Burma Burma is population is 53 million in total including the Rohingya Bangladesh is population is about 160 million For that reason the Burmese military fears that the larger Muslim country of Bangladesh would push the Muslim population into Arakan or Rakhine And they would take over the land using Rohingyas as a proxy Although the earlier generation of Burmese military leaders including my great uncle had accepted the Rohingya as our ethnic people In the mid1960s Gen Ne Win and his deputies in the military decided that they must get rid of Rohingya first to make sure that the Rohingya in Rakhine state could not become proxies that would advance the interest of the then East Pakistan that was the name of Bangladesh before 1971 Rohingya have been singled out for this genocidal policy by the Burmese military since Q What about other Muslim communities living in another part of Myanmar MZ We have a total of about 16 different types of Muslim populations but only Rohingya are confronted or subject to this textbook example of genocide There is no such thing as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing because there are no textbooks written on ethnic cleansing only genocide Rohingya have a strategic pocket of geography that they legitimately call their ancestral land which is right in between Burma and Bangladesh If you have been to the Rohingya area on the Bangladeshi side Chittagong or Cox is Bazar the largest refugee camp of Rohingya in the world you will notice geography is seamless The mountain ranges and rivers are seamlessly connected with the Arakan Besides that area at one point was a single cultural and demographic and economic community Q Like in other regions India and China are battling for strategic supremacy in Myanmar India is desperate to complete the ambitious US 484 million Kaladan Multimodal Project which ends at Rakhine port so is China also involved in a big way Does this war of interests also affect Rohingya in the region MZ Of course yes Because of this strategic rivalry the Burmese military particularly has been able to play China and India against each other The multimillion or multibilliondollar projects along the Arakan coastline or like the giving the mineral rights concessions or gas exploration rights you will see a pattern of the Burmese military making sure both India and China received something Yeah So in other words while they are playing India and China against each other they are also trying to maintain the benefits of being friends or allies with both powers Western countries competing in the Arakan region Q Which are other countries competing for natural resources in the country MZ There are also western countries that are competing in the Arakan region If you look at the largest top five investors there are hundreds of millions of dollars invested by each country You will find rich Asian countries Singapore Japan South Korea Taiwan some from Hong Kong definitely China and then India And then you will also find these western governments that are talking up human rights violations and even expressing concerns about the genocide such as the United Kingdom that you know or Norway which presents itself as peace exporting or peaceful country But Norway is also competing in Arakan offshore gas exploration So in Arakan itself if you focus on just the mineral rights exploration like gas and oil offshore you will find about 15 different national investors competing to stay friendly to the Burmese government Because the Burmese military and Aung San Suu Kyi government control these multibilliondollar projects They control who would get what So I think we cannot talk about the Rohingya genocide or this persecution of Muslims in Burma without talking about western and Asian investors coming in investing in infrastructure projects or investing in industrial agricultural development or multimodal port projects We cannot simply focus on talking about Burmese military troops killing Muslims killing Rohingya driving one million Rohingya out of the country over the past 10 years We have to talk about this capitalist competition So therefore I do not see the virtue in the UK or the USA or the European Union when they say that they are concerned about the wellbeing of Rohingya people or refugees humanitarian crisis They too have blood on their hand through their investment in Rakhine in particular and in Burma as a whole We cannot separate the two This is the same situation we had in the 1930s and 40s in Nazi Germany Q The International Court of Justice ICJ has ordered measures to prevent the genocide of Rohingya What is the significance of the ICJ order for the Rohingya community MZ There is an assumption that at the end of this legal proceeding there will be enough evidence to show that Myanmar has commissioned the crime of genocide I think the most significant gain is that ICJ has established that Rohingya people qualify as a protected group under international law The ICJ has established in its January provisional measures that Rohingya qualify as a protected group under the Genocide Convention And the other significance is that Myanmar is forced to appear in the court in Hague Aung San Suu Kyi herself and top senior officials had to answer to the ICJ The international court does not have the army or the power to enforce any ruling it may come up at the end of this trial When a country is being tried it enables human rights activists particularly Rohingya refugees themselves to campaign for the end of this genocide So there are three major benefits or maybe progress that have been accomplished by having this ICJ case ICJ order will prevent future mass killings Q But what next now I mean how far these measures can mitigate the pain of these people MZ You know Myanmar has submitted the report that was required as part of the provisional measures By the end of the first 4 months Myanmar was ordered to submit the report to the ICJ laying out or spelling out concrete measures that Myanmar has undertaken in compliance with the provisional measures Provisional measures have two different types of orders One was the preservation of what we will call a crime scene in a vast area That concerns the preservation of evidence the land the property And the other one is the protection of the Rohingya who remain in the country that is estimated to be about half a million Q The question again arises whether these measures will mitigate and end future violence MZ I will say it has the potential to mitigate future mass killings Myanmar has killed a large number of Rohingya people in different waves of organized violence by the military and not by the Rakhine people Rakhine people have partaken or joined the Burmese troops but the primary killings and disruptions and rape and loot were done by the government So when the government is being challenged at the ICJ its troops will not be in a position like they were before to organize another wave of killing It is true that they have not rolled back their policies and these policies have been made into law for instance citizenship law So I think we still have a long way to go But in terms of the immediate future I do not see Myanmar government troops organizing another mass killing as they did in 2017 Q You are a Buddhist but you support the Rohingya Muslims But why not many people like you in Myanmar have come forward to help the persecuted people MZ I am Buddhist culturally and my philosophical orientation is Buddhist mindfulness But I am not supporting Rohingya as Muslims I am supporting them as fellow Burmese and more importantly as fellow humans Of course I also support the Palestinians I also support the Uighurs openly And I actively support other oppressed communities Because I identified myself with them as a fellow human Q Why there is no sympathy left for Rohingya within Myanmar civil society MZ There is a growing number of young Burmese Buddhists and even monks who support the Rohingya Some of them are afraid You know that they do not want to be targeted by violent racists So it is the fear that is holding these more openminded Buddhists I was involved in creating this network of a Buddhist and other nonRohingya Muslims as well as Christians and Hindus to stand up for the Rohingya We have a network or networks of multifaith activists who say Rohingya belong here But their voices are being drowned out by famous people like Aung San Suu Kyi and powerful military generals or influential monks That is why we are not hearing their voices as much as we hear the voices of the killers Death threats and character assassination Q What has been your experience since you took up the cause of supporting Rohingya We have heard that you were fired from Brunei University which came under pressure from the Myanmar government MZ I started writing about this issue from November 2011 which was about six months before the first bout of mass organized violence against Rohingya took place in Rakhine I saw what scholars would call racist mobilization of public opinion against the minority group So I started talking about the dangers of this mobilization because I monitor the Burmese through chat rooms and social media Naturally I received negative reactions from Burmese institutions I also voluntarily resigned from the University Brunei Darussalam in January 2013 when the university administration told me to shut up to not talk to the media to not appear on television in Singapore or other places They declined my request for leave to go and give lectures on the genocide of Rohingya I started talking about the Rohingya issue using the genocide framework as early as 2013 So when they censored me I broke the contract and then went to Malaysia where I was given a senior research fellowship at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur I only lasted there for a year and a half although the University and the Malaysian government were very supportive I came under the serious death threat from the Burmese thugs that Malaysian Special Branch established as having links with the Burmese embassy in Kuala Lumpur Therefore I relocated with my family back to the UK where my wife and researcher colleague is from Since then there have been a series of campaigns against me labeling me as a national traitor and enemy of the state Because I say what my country is doing to the Rohingya is genocide The fear of my life is real But it does not stop me There have also been relentless attempts at the assassination of my character saying that I received millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia or rich Muslims and whatnot And none of that is true There is also an attack on my professional credentials Like there is a campaign that I do not have a PhD from the University of Wisconsin at Madison That I am a fake scholar One of the grandsons of the late dictator Gen Ne Win openly called on the Burmese military intelligence to run a special operation like the Israeli Mossad operation against Adolf Eichmann to hit me Eichmann was captured in Latin America brought to Jerusalem and tried and hanged in 1962 So that is the kind of threat I have received Q There have been many UN missions to address the Rohingya issue Why so far they have not been able to put any pressure on the Myanmar government MZ UN has been concerned about three things in Burma since 199293 when it decided that Myanmar must have a special human rights investigator The formal term is UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar It was mandated to report on the military is political repression against Aung San Suu Kyi and Burmese opposition movements the democrats The other one was Myanmar is treatment of ethnic communities in the nonRohingya ethnic regions particularly Shan state Karen state and Karenni state along the Thai Burmese and Chinese Burmese borders And the third but not the least important one was the persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine including forced labor and different types of crimes against humanity The genocide was not the language that the UN uses or used in those days That was 1993 UN has been engaged in this issue for over 25 years Hundreds of reports have been released and numerous meetings have been held And then there is another one UN special envoy They go and attempt to mediate the conflict in Burma But they are not concerned about the human rights situation primarily UNSC can only bring pressure on Myanmar Q What is the correct approach to bring pressure on the Myanmar government MZ The real pressure that the Burmese military would feel is the activation of Chapter Seven the threat to use the political and military intervention in a situation that can be deemed the destabilizing Only the Security Council can bring real pressure on the Burmese military But the Burmese military is more than persuaded or convinced by the assurances it has received from China and to a lesser extent Russia China has used its veto power So Burma enjoys double protection at the institution that can end the genocide Russia frames the Burmese treatment of Rohingya as an anti or counterterrorist operation China has repeatedly framed this issue of Rohingya persecution as an internal affair Of course China can only be expected to take this position because China is at a pregenocidal stage concerning its treatment on the persecution of Muslim Uighurs So as long as the Security Council remains divided among the veto powers on the Burmese genocide of Rohingya cannot expect any concrete pressure from the UN as a whole Bangladesh cannot do much except complain that there is not enough pressure coming from the international community As a result of this situation Bangladesh has chosen not to play hardball with the Burmese Bangladesh knows without the Security Council without the powerful regional government or a military backing Dhaka Bangladesh cannot do much Turkey extremely supportive Q Which are the countries you think who have shown a spine and helped Rohingya in political and financial terms What has been the role of Turkey in supporting the Rohingya MZ In terms of the funding if we count the dollars the US and Canada are number one and number two contributors to address the humanitarian situation of the Rohingya both inside Myanmar and in the Rohingya camps in Cox is Bazar Bangladesh Britain has also made a sizable financial contribution That is followed by countries like Turkey which is an extremely supportive government concerning the Rohingya But Turkey has also faced some pushback My understanding is that it wanted to build better physical infrastructures in terms of the refugee accommodation in Cox is Bazar But the Bangladesh government does not want the living conditions to become too comfortable for the Rohingya Their goal is to make sure that one million Rohingya refugees return to Arakan or Rakhine The World Bank has also offered grants I think like 500 million I do not have the exact numbers Out of that 1 million Rohingya refugees about 300000 of them are schoolaged children So the World Bank is rightly concerned about making sure that new generations of Rohingya are equipped with the skill to think for themselves or to have a vocational skill That is also in the interest of Bangladesh as well as other Rohingya concerned countries If the goal of the international community starting with Bangladesh is to send Rohingya back to their country we have to ask the questions Do you want Rohingya people particularly younger generations to return to their country with no education no skills with no leadership capacity I think this is a similar situation that we had in Cambodia where Khmer Rouge destroyed leaders artists journalists and doctors So it is so crucial we give them opportunities so they develop themselves individually as a community When the time comes for their return to their places of origin they will be able to develop their community Therefore Turkey should undertake all the efforts in terms of education m for instance increase the number of students it helps within Bangladesh or on its Turkish soil Arakan Buddhists showing willingness to reconcile with Rohingya Q Since you are in touch with people on the ground what is the condition right now inside Rakhine state as Myanmar government says there is no more violence MZ There is escalating military conflict between the Arakan Buddhists operating under the name of the Arakan Army and the Burmese central government troops Arakan army has been very effective as a military unit I want to make readers and audiences understand that the Arakan Army is led by Rakhine Buddhists who do not see the Rohingya people as their enemy Their leadership has shown the will to reconcile with the Rohingyas And also within the Rakhine younger generation there is an awareness that they have been made to hate Rohingya Muslims through propaganda by the Burmese colonizers So that some positive things are happening as well When the Burmese military uses heavy artillery and airstrikes against the Arakan Army in the Rakhine villages of course the Rohingya are also affected literally and psychologically Q There are reports in some local media that Rohingya are returning from Bangladesh in recent weeks and four of them test positive for Coronavirus Is it possible for them to return to Myanmar MZ But in terms of the Rohingya from the Cox is Bazar or the nearby Teknaf in Bangladesh I must say the borders between Chittagong or Cox is Bazar in Bangladesh and the Arakan or Rakhine on the Burma side is heavily monitored and heavily securitized by the Burmese military border troops So if the Rohingya are coming in from the Bangladeshi the side they come in with the knowledge of the Burmese military It is like the West Bank in Israel The Palestinians have to go through checkpoints to get to the Israeli side to go and work in menial labor conditions This applies to the Burmese situation as well So maybe the The Burmese military is allowing a small number of Rohingya to come in and then using them as a propaganda tool to say that Rohingya are coming back with Coronavirus That is also in line with the Burmese military portrayal of Rohingya people as a whole as a threat to Buddhist is way of life now as a threat to Burmese public health conditions In the old European Jews were portrayed genocidally as disease carriers Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi equally responsible Q You have watched Aung San Suu Kyi so closely She was perceived as a democrat who will ensure reforms and reconciliation Why she became instrumental in persecuting Rohingya MZ I supported Aung San Suu Kyi for 15 years since the uprising in 1988 until around 2004 and 2005 In the Rohingya genocide she is instrumental at the ideological level She does not control the military That is under the direct control of the commander in chief But what she controls is the civilian line ministries that are also involved in the persecution of Rohingya Muslims The genocide is not simply how many people the Burmese military kill or how many Rohingya women are raped or how many villages were burned to the ground by the military Genocide is essentially about the destruction of a Rohingya community including its religious and ethnic identity in multiple ways So therefore the destruction of the Rohingya as a community involves denial of access to life is health services and education Rohingya have no access to primary medicine preventive medicine emergency medicine Rohingya have no access to proper education Over 100000 Rohingya have been put in what the New York Times called the concentration camps in Rakhine State I am not talking about the refugees in Bangladesh I am talking about those on the Burmese soil that Aung San Suu Kyi controls Every time there is a special operation against Rohingya there are about 10 different nonsecurity sector ministries involved These are under the control of Aung San Suu Kyi She is the most powerful civilian political leader She controls the party completely like an autocrat More importantly she is the most influential public opinion maker The entire Buddhist population calls her Mother So when she says that the Burmese public is afraid of Muslims like the rest of the nonMuslim world are afraid of Muslims she validates the Buddhist fear of Muslims without offering any insight empirical reason why we should be afraid of Muslims She did not mention that Muslims are also victims of western powers If you look at the Middle East You know even under Obama administration in the US seven different Muslim countries were concurrently attacked So when Suu Kyi validates this popular Islamophobia held by the Burmese public she reinforces the Burmese military is propaganda that Muslims particularly Rohingya Muslims are a threat to national security a threat to the Buddhist way of life and now a threat to Burmese public health In that regard domestically Aung San Suu Kyi is so culpable criminally responsible for the genocide That is why she is named in the lawsuit filed by the Rohingya group based in the UK called Burmese Rohingya Organization UK in Argentina Someone like me a small person activists on the street was saying this is genocide no one was paying attention But when Aung San Suu Kyi said well look this is not genocide then the New York Times would publish it on the front page and say she denies this is genocide So in that sense internationally she became a denier of the genocide and defender of the killers Expectations from neighboring countries Q How do you assess the role of neighboring countries like India and Bangladesh in addressing the Rohingya issue as both countries have been hosting refugees In India often Hindu hardline elements create raucous against them MZ In India the number of refugees is insignificant India has a population of over one billion India is home to a large diaspora of Tibetans India has essentially allowed Tibetans to set up their city Dharamshala where Dalai Lama is based So the Indian population as a whole is not hostile to refugees In 1971 almost 10 million East Bengalis or Bangladeshis took refuge in India for a year until they could return to their country A total of less than 40000 Rohingya have taken refuge in different parts of India But no less than a person like Home Minister of India called them termites It is like Adolf Hitler Joseph Goebbels calling the Jews viruses or cockroaches So we have that situation in India On top of that Prime Minister Modi went to Myanmar capital Naypyidaw in 2017 shared a press conference with Aung San Suu Kyi where she described the Rohingya situation as an antiterrorist operation by the military of Burma Under the Modi government India is deregistering several million Muslims in Assam who was born in India And then say India would welcome Buddhists from Nepal Bhutan and other places to come and become Indian citizens Q What are your expectations from Bangladesh MZ I have my criticism about Bangladesh But there is no other country in the world where one million Rohingya are hosted My only critique and my only request to the Bangladeshi authorities is they should recognize Rohingya by their name and as refugees with certain rights that ought to be respected And then finally Bangladesh should lift the internet ban in Rohingya camps There might be some criminal Rohingya that is just unavoidable But the overwhelming majority of Rohingya are peaceful and they are grateful to and appreciative of Bangladesh both the society and the government and the leadership of Sheikh Hasina I think Bangladesh should treat the Rohingya as partners to address drug trafficking human trafficking and the spread of Coronavirus in the camps The refugee should not be seen as a potential threat to Bangladesh Q What has been the role of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN countries MZ The ASEAN has failed in every single atrocity crime that is committed by its member state or within his backyard starting with the Cambodian genocide I asked the Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur a year ago Why do you want to support the Rohingya and why do you want to champion the end of genocide He said As ASEAN we feel for Cambodian people when onethird of the Cambodian population died or was murdered by Khmer Rouge in less than four years starting in 1975 We do not want to repeat the mistake of letting another genocide happen So therefore I think ASEAN should not fail in the case of another genocide committed by its member within its sphere But so far it has failed in its duty towards Rohingya EXCLUSIVE Rohingya issue not Muslims vs Buddhist paradigm

end righting in the key port city of Hodeida but brought little actual progress The talks proposed by AlMalki would be the first facetoface peace negotiations among the Saudis Houthis and government since the war started In addition to representatives from the two warring parties alMalki said a Saudi military team would also be presentIn the past informal and secretive talks took place inside Saudi Arabia and Oman between the Houthis and Saudis Both sides blamed the failure of the talks on manipulation by Saudi Arabia or Iran The conflict has killed over 100000 people and created the world

will reaffirm our strong support to the UN efforts for a political solution to the conflict and to the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 2254 A political solution reached through a UNmediated inclusive Syrianled and Syrianowned dialogue is the only way of achieving sustainable peace in Syria The alternative is ever more misery caused by the obstinate determination of the longdiscredited regime This year on top of being the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War Syria is close to economic collapse The regimes mismanagement of the economy widespread corruption the financial crisis in neighboring Lebanon and the Coronavirus pandemic have brought the countrys economy to its knees The situation is dire Syria faces its highest inflation rate ever alongside a record devaluation of its national currency Eight in ten Syrians reportedly live in poverty and even toptier salary earners are left with little real purchasing power Basic goods are becoming scarce food and medicine are starting to become unaffordable to ordinary people Syrians want the same things as every person and family anywhere else in the world personal security jobs and a future for their children In other words they need prospects for the future The EU and its Member States have been supporting Syrians everywhere since the start of the conflict Over 20 billion have been provided in humanitarian stabilization and resilience assistance since 2011 for Syrians in Syria and in support of the neighboring countries We are very grateful for the solidarity shown by Jordan Lebanon and Turkey in particular They are looking after more than 56 million Syrian refugees These countries are struggling with complex domestic situations they continue to need assistance to meet the growing needs of both the refugees and their own people The EU is also helping them Our assistance in response to the Syrian crisis does not only benefit Syrian refugees but also the Lebanese Jordanian and Turkish people to create job opportunities infrastructure including schools as well as better health and water services The EU Regional Trust Fund MADAD has helped communities in Lebanon and Jordan by providing basic income access to health services and to education and much more ensuring that Syrian refugees and local hosts alike have a foundation to build a better future In Turkey the EU supports an emergency social safety net the access of Syrian refugees to highquality Turkish health services and school enrolment In Syria itself we have been doing what we can to foster livelihoods support communities and stimulate the very basics of economic life Since 2011 the EU put in place sanctions in response to the actions of the regime and its supporters The goal of these measures is to put pressure on the Syrian regime to halt repression and negotiate a lasting political settlement of the Syrian crisis in line with UNSC Resolution 2254 under UN auspices These sanctions target designated people and entities not the population They do not prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid or prohibit the export of food medicine or medical equipment Today we want to tell the Syrian people and the people of the countries hosting the refugees that we know what they have been going through that we care and that we will continue to stand by them We know that the Syrian refugees dearest dream is to go back home We are ready to help make this happen once the conditions are in place But to what home It is not realistic to expect refugees to return to the risk of being arrested tortured or forced to fight a war they wanted to escape Their security of life and of property needs to be guaranteed And we know that the stability necessary for the reconciliation and reconstruction of Syria will only come once the regime renounces brutality and embarks on a process of genuine political dialogue backed with tangible changes and moves that will heal Syria is wounds That was is and remains our goal

shifting the Kashmir movement to a decisive new phase according to Pakistani philosopher and economist Khurshid Ahmad But he added the responsibility lies with the leadership in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir to make fruitful gains to the current situation focusing on the right to selfdetermination and reaching out to world capitals by lobbying conferences and campaigns Ahmad the author of several books including The Contemporary Economic Challenges And Islam Economic Development in an Islamic Framework and Fanaticism Intolerance and Islam leads Pakistan is top think tank the Institute of Policy Studies He insisted that a new research group on Kashmir be established while the scope and role of Kashmir Committee be widened by including advisors technocrats and Kashmir experts In an interview with Anadolu Agency Ahmad a former federal minister for planning and a senator in Pakistan advocated for an international relief fund for Kashmir to help residents in the disputed region whose economy is under duress especially after a 2016 antiIndia uprising Anadolu Agency You have mentioned in one of your writeups that the Kashmir movement has entered into its decisive phase What do you mean by that Khurshid Ahmad KA For more than the past 70 years I have been observing aspects of Kashmir from every angle I have been reflecting on its history and the crests and troughs of the movement of the right of selfdetermination I have been writing on this topic for the past 60 years I have no reservations in professing that the phase of this movement that has begun after 2016 and especially the situation that developed after Aug 5 2019 the struggle has arrived in its final phase Although it is difficult to predict the duration of this phase there are palpable signs to predict that this is the last stage of the movement Q At this decisive phase stage what would be your recommendations KA Let us be clear Kashmir is not a land dispute between India and Pakistan The issue is the question of selfdetermination of the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir a part of the agenda for the partition of India The issue is not bilateral It is an international issue and is there on the agenda of the UN Security Council It has become imperative for Pakistan to adopt an effective and consistent line of thinking and action at this juncture We can delay some issues necessary in the life of our nation out of diplomatic and other compulsions But as a Pakistani and a Muslim we cannot ignore Kashmir or render it to a secondary status It is the responsibility of the people the government of Pakistan the government of Azad Kashmir and the overseas Pakistanis and Kashmiri diaspora to raise the issue at the international level This target cannot be achieved only by issuing statements and messages on Twitter Basic and effective efforts are needed for this purpose If we shall attend to these issues positive results are not too far No doubt Indian fascism and discrimination against Muslims and other minorities need to be exposed through our diplomatic efforts But it is prudent to make a separate strategy and an appropriate narrative for it It should be a part of our strategy We should present it as a separate issue because of its dynamics While we should talk about the rights of Indian Muslims and the other minorities but should not allow it to be mixed with the Kashmir issue Q It is said that Azad Kashmir is a base camp for the Kashmir resistance movement What is your observation about the role of government and political parties in Muzaffarabad as a base camp KA The Azad Jammu and Kashmir AJK government should be allowed to take initiative and design a strategy in its own right The president and the prime minister of AJK are both leaders with standing and competence The political parties of AJK must set aside their affiliation with the political parties of Pakistan and form a national government Despite having a separate identity and being in opposition in Pakistan they should work collectively with discipline and focus on the freedom of Kashmir They should ensure an ideal government and governance in AJK They should not drag Pakistani politics inside Kashmir It should be noted here that there was complete unanimity among political parties until 1972 that Pakistani political parties should avoid casting their shadow on AJK ExPakistan Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto for the first time pushed Pakistani political parties into the politics of AJK But the experience of 48 years shows that Pakistani politics in Azad Kashmir has damaged their cause and struggle All Pakistani political parties should return to the pre1972 position unanimously There is an example from JamaateIslami Pakistan which never tried to build its unit or to interfere in the affairs of JamaateIslami Azad Kashmir Although both have adopted the same name they are separate organizations in all respects Q Kashmir Committee in Pakistan has always got mired in controversies What is your evaluation of this institution KA The performance of the Kashmir Committee during the last two decades has been disappointing The present government has also not been able to make it effective so far Nonetheless the Committee can and must play an important role within the country and abroad A competent knowledgeable and active person should head this Committee He should have an aura persona and an understanding to present the case at the national and international levels with full devotion It is also suggested to appoint a special advisor to the Kashmir Committee He must be an expert and proficient in global diplomacy The Kashmir Committee and its head should operate with passion and take lessons from history Q What is your opinion of an effective Kashmir Committee KA A committee should be set up in Pakistan in consultation with the AJK government for wider consultations which should include former foreign ministers and prominent ambassadors The people who have served effectively in Europe the Far East America and the Arab world should be sought to play their role Launching a global campaign to enforce a political and social boycott of India should also be considered This factor played a key role in the liberation and to end racial discrimination in South Africa The Boycott Divestment Sanctions BDS campaign against Israel launched by the Palestine freedom movement has found considerable takers in the world We should try to present the case of Kashmir legally in international institutions and international court based on UN resolutions reports of human rights institutions and resolutions of the Security Council of the General Assembly International conferences have the importance on national and international levels But it is most important that meetings should be held with parliamentarians of different countries They should try to present the resolutions on Kashmir in their parliaments Contacts should be made with human rights organizations and try to pass resolutions there Q Returning to the question that the movement has entered into a decisive phase how do you assess the present stage and is there any qualitative change KA The qualitative change is that the force of resistance against the occupied forces in Kashmir and the rulers of Delhi has mounted to such a level that the fear of death has vanished It is the most prominent and commendable situation of this freedom movement In the meantime the proIndian Muslim leadership has exposed itself to such an extent that their narratives have become meaningless No doubt this danger has not ended completely But they have become ineffective and soulless in the eyes of people It is a major development Similarly there is also an important development that in India media and political groups are discussing the change of status and human rights violations in Kashmir It is something unusual It is a positive change This aspect has a lot of possibilities in itself There is one more aspect that despite Indian political position and trade interests many countries are demanding accountability Although these demands seem weak and ineffective they are being raised All these aspects exhibit that we are heading towards a decisive era It is a great challenge for us how we can utilize these possibilities Q Which parts in your mind in these situations bear most of the responsibility KA The most important turf is in occupied Kashmir The respected Syed Ali Geelani Sahib had kept this movement active strong and in the right direction with his wisdom courage energy and extraordinary consistency But he has serious healthrelated issues these days We should pray for his health with all sincerity Despite his falling health and Indian restrictions he has utilized every opportunity to guide his nation Now the need of the hour is to seek a supportive leadership for Ali Geelani It should include people encapsulated with revolutionary ideas and constructive thoughts This leadership should possess the qualities that include robust faith complete awareness about the history infinite courage and understanding like Geelani Sahib It should not be emotive and touchy but tolerant The movement should not only remain effective and organized on the ground but it should also remain popular democratic coherent and have a real sense of its goal Q Many other issues have not added to the Kashmir movement It is not only now the right of selfdetermination but issues related to the demographic characteristics of the region have also cropped up What is your antidote to this issue KA The objective of India is recent steps is to transform its occupation of Kashmir into permanent annexation to harm the identity of Kashmiris and to reduce the majority of the Muslim population into a minority It is the worst form of imperialism This deserves to be fully expressed and made central to the freedom struggle The Kashmiri Muslims who had supported the Indian rule over the past many decades have confessed now clearly that India has deceived them They lack confidence in the Indian government But despite that Indian policymaking institutions are contacting these people to hoodwink them again to use them again If Indian elements succeed it will be dangerous In this background the forces who are against Indian aggression should come forward and join hands with these people and secure them Q It apparently seems that proIndia parties including National Conference NC and People is Democratic Party PDP who ruled Kashmir are no more in good books of India What is your view about the future of these parties and their leaders KA They should be asked to ally on a common issue Even if they do not become allies at least they should not be allowed to become part of Indian strategy once again It will be a useful step indeed We observe that India is now trying to produce a new crop of proIndian leadership It encouraged many people for this purpose But so far all in vain We must expose these people who are ready to become part of the Indian game plan Their names background and shenanigans should be exposed and highlighted But at the same time doors should remain open for new people to join the movement and they need to be engaged in discussions Q India has been trying to link the Kashmir movement to terrorism What is your response to Indian claims KA We should remain mindful that any illegal occupation leads to resistance The UN Charter also acknowledges it Out of 200 members of the UN 150 of them have been liberated while exercising their right to selfdetermination It is a continuous process The UN admits that if this right of selfdetermination is not granted through democratic means and if it is usurped through brute power then its demand takes the shape of a resistance The UN also recognizes this right of resistance It means that exercising this right of resistance to achieve the goal of the right of selfdetermination is not terrorism But after 911 India has tried to link the Kashmir freedom movement to terrorism Afghan Taliban which was regarded as terrorists for rejecting aggression and hostility of powerful countries is now part of discussions and process of settlement Q What are other necessary steps in your opinion needed to be taken immediately KA We should consider raising a paramilitary force in AJK The region may not have its military force but establishing a paramilitary is the need of the hour In case there are calls to demilitarize the region and Pakistan is asked to withdraw its forces then there should be a local force capable to defend the region It will be possible only if there is a welltrained and professional paramilitary force along with the police Also there is a need to establish a Kashmir research group It should work consistently on the Kashmir issue and provide the latest information to the Kashmir Committee of Pakistan and All Parties Kashmir Conference It should collect analyze and present correctly the positive and negative statements and the writings about Kashmir It should work as a thinktank to devise analyze and study alternate strategies and predict policies for different scenarios In India many books and articles are published which reflect rethinking on the issue of Kashmir and the need for its resolution These books and articles also mention India is acts of genocide in Kashmir These points need to be highlighted Q There are many research groups already working How could the new group you are recommending be different KA Yes there are many groups working The one I am discussing must be effective in researching and tracing the history of the movement and the Kashmir Issue The significance of the issue should be narrated almost in all important languages using social media platforms Documentaries should be commissioned on various aspects of the Kashmir issue Just holding conferences delivering speeches and arranging social gatherings are not enough The resultoriented conferences should be conducted where targets are set and strategies are discussed and approved Q Although world media has written a lot about Kashmir and criticized Indian actions over the past year it seems not resonating with the actions of governments What is the reason KA There is an issue of convincing people the world over We should approach the important political and media forums and try to motivate and facilitate them We should research and produce different materials related to the Kashmir issue The most important task is to send these projects through mainstream and social media to the whole world This can be done by Pakistan based Kashmiris and their diaspora living in different countries It is difficult to undertake such work from inside Occupied Kashmir But there is a possibility to do it from outside systematically Q Due to a yearlong lockdown first due to political situation and then due to the COVID19 pandemic the economy in Kashmir has taken a hit The trade across the Line of Control was stopped a year ago Kashmir is mainstays of economy horticulture and tourism are in the doldrums As an economist what will you recommend to put a semblance of the economy back on rails KA It is necessary to establish an international relief fund for Occupied Kashmir especially because of the coronavirus pandemic and consistent lockdown since last August The traders and the common Kashmiri have suffered huge economic losses They have been destroyed economically They are surrounded by almost 1 million troops They do not have the daily supplies and requirements necessary for a living The medical facilities are poor They need urgent humanitarian assistance from the international community The people of other countries should be contacted for this purpose Resources should be collected and sent to them assiduously This issue needs immediate and urgent attention Kashmir movement shifting to a decisive new phase

coronavirus hotspot While tensions were reduced through an agreement between Turkey and Russia regarding Idlib the Assad regime is dirty games continue Currently there are 35 million civilians in Idlib not including the 1 million who have fled Idlib since December 2019 Many of the refugees who fled relocated to camps on the Turkish border Turkey in the meantime continues to provide all types of support including education medical services and food to the refugees without interruption and under all types of conditions While the world is preoccupied with coronavirus the humanitarian tragedy continues in many countries like Syria where the world has closed its eyes The World Health Organization has sent coronavirus test kits to the Assad regime but not to suffering regions including the refugee camps After nine years of war many hospitals have either been demolished or become inoperable I would like to underline that 84 hospitals and healthcare facilities were damaged and hundreds of healthcare personnel have been attacked in the Idlib area since December Even though healthcare services provided to Syrian nationals escaping Assad still continues in certain regions with the support of the United Nations and Turkey in particular the coronavirus threat has started to spread in Syria as well Refugees who are already living in unsanitary conditions need help otherwise it is likely that things could get out of control I recently spoke with Bassam Barabandi who served as a diplomat to the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Barabandi stated that it is a good thing the ceasefire between Turkey and Russia is continuing however the most important issue is the withholding of information on coronavirus deaths in Syria Barabandi who claims that there are thousands of coronavirus cases and hundreds of people who have died from the virus in Syria emphasised the possibility of great distress in refugee camps near the border of Turkey in the near future I also spoke with Dr Waleed Tamer President of North Free Doctors Syndicate who said that they had four cases recently in the northwest in which tests were taken and sent to Turkey He added that the Assad regime is underplaying all coronavirus infections because those who transmit the disease to Syria are the Iranian mercenaries who cross the border without any restrictions He highlighted that Turkey despite the circumstances is the only country that really helps them and their medical personnel were trained in Ankara to diagnose injuries conduct awareness campaigns and provide protection methods Suzanne Meriden of the Syrian American Council stated that the Assad regime is withholding information from the public and the World Health Organization about coronavirus cases and that there is a serious spread of the virus through the border with Iran Meriden also remarked that they are trying to keep this issue on their top agenda by working with international organizations and theyre trying to draw attention through public campaigns The subject of Iran in particular is extremely serious According to the latest data provided by Johns Hopkins University there are over 29000 cases and over 2200 deaths in Iran Most people dont realise or ignore the fact that there is a serious danger in Syria considering the close links between Syria and Iran and the freedom of movement at the borders According to data from the Assad regime it has only just been announced that there is only one case of coronavirus The Syrian health minister reported that the countrys first coronavirus case is a woman in her 20s who is travelling through Syria Does that sound convincing Claiming that there has been only one coronavirus case in Syria the Assad regime has been lying to the world for weeks as usual However humanitarian organisations are clearly stating that there are very serious cases in Syria and the virus is spreading rapidly If necessary precautions are not taken and support is not provided coronavirus can seriously spread over the country causing considerable deaths According to the information I gathered from local sources the doctors working there immediately require masks gloves hygienic products and testing kits to be able to provide sufficient service Yes the entire world is dealing with coronavirus There are nearly 500000 cases and over 22000 deaths Each country is fighting this calamity which means everybody is busy with their own crisis Many international institutions including the World Health Organization are not helping the ones that are most in need of help outside of making lofty announcements International organisations are on the verge of leaving an innocent nation alone in their fight against the coronavirus just as they turned their head the other way after Assad killed half a million innocent civilians Now Western and international organisations should impose severe sanctions on the Assad Regime and should transmit aid to the people who are really in need otherwise we will leave Syria to suffer alone again but this time against a global pandemic We welcome all pitches and submissions to TRT World Opinion please send them via email to

million undocumented workers in Europe 21 percent from the Middle East and North Africa and 17 percent from subSaharan Africa Before the Covid19 pandemic the informal economy workers struggled to meet their basic survival needs With the spread of Covid19 the struggle for survival doubled or tripled said Oksana Abboud International Coordinator at StreetNet International an organisation representing street vendors around the world told TRT World Farah says her journey to Spain was difficult She made two attempts The first time she says she paid over 6000 euros to mafias but had to return home after being caught and held by authorities On the second attempt in 2006 authorities detained her sending her to a detention centre in Ceuta She says she spent six months there with her 14yearold son later gaining a temporary residence in Spain But she says she was denied a renewal leaving both her and her son undocumented in the country and unable to contribute to things like pensions Now Farah

undocumented migrant farm labourer from Senegal He works in Spains fields close to Lleida Catalunya a popular spot for west African migrants He would like to potentially see similar measures introduced in Spain for undocumented migrants Now they need people to work in the fields Working in the fields is hard Its work which only migrants do he told TRT World He says he is paid off the books around 2530 euros for 1012 hours shifts After Covid19 we are looking to keep working to make a better life for our family to send money to them in Senegal so that our family can eat because we dont want to rob We want to work in a dignified and peaceful way to help our families Such undocumented workers in European countries might feel more protected and safer as they get some relief packages support from the European governments national and local and of course they would not return to their homes in Africa in opposite they help their relatives with transferring remittances for them to sustain somehow said Abboud coordinator at StreetNet International More than 550bn in remittances were sent last year across the globe according to the World Bank with 48bn heading to SubSaharan Africa but now the organisation is warning the pandemic has impacted remittances Remittance watchers are predicting a sizable 2025 percent downturn in remittance flows in Q1 2020 not seen since the start of the Great Recession in 2008 Paul Vaaler a chaired professor at the University of Minnesota is law and business schools told TRT World Domino effect According to the World Bank remittances play a driving role in alleviating poverty for middle and lowerincome countries and help to solve food insecurity and livelihood needs They warn the decline represents loss of a crucial financing lifeline for many vulnerable households during the pandemic In countries like Haiti or Zimbabwe remittances can account for a third or more of total GDP said Vaaler In Zimbabwe the UNs World

disease COVID19 Bury Britain May 7 2020 REUTERS Photo We hear so many predictions for the way that the world might be changing for the better in the aftermath of the COVID19 pandemic There is currently a genuine hope that humanity will learn so many significant lessons from the ills of the way we currently live consume and run our societies However once the immediate impact of the pandemic lessens and become more habitual over the next few months there is a risk of the current lessonstobelearnt agenda losing its attractiveness Returning to the old normal might unfortunately become more appealing This is why and how such an eventuality could possibly be avoided First of all expecting huge shifts in all aspects of what we do and how would likely demand almost a complete overhaul of our affairs from our immediate communities to global relations Subsequently as this would really test humanitys ability to change there is always a risk for such a progressive agenda being sidelined Instead we might opt for scapegoating Such a scapegoat might be different from country to country such as migrants gays or nudity on TV in some and the act of devious external actors in others or simply China for the most as it is where the pandemic started a few months ago If we do not want scapegoating to dominate the agenda then we would need to start a comprehensive soul searching for this and higher education institutions could be well placed to run the truth and reconciliation commissions of this process There is currently a flourishing energy for change globally but to place this in a sound framework and progress effectively we first need to identify the root causes of the problems The change agenda is clearly huge and whether this is in regard to the exploitation of the nature unsustainably leaving global injustices unaddressed acting unethically in governance ignoring the plight of vulnerable populations and many other problems a separate truth recovery might be required On the other hand there is already so much evidence on all of these challenges so this might be a matter of the collating the necessary information as a result of coordinated partnerships between universities thinktanks civil society organizations and governments to provide the information on state of affairs and drivers for change in accessible formats for awareness systems development and policy changes Second even with the optimistic estimates this pandemic is expected to kill hundreds of thousands and causing major economic losses because of the total and partial shutdown of towns cities businesses transportation links and trade From the health and education services to logistics entertainment and finance almost all sectors have already been badly affected and such effects will be worsening further and subsequently will definitely leave long lasting damages The scale of potential economic problems is such that the European Union is now talking about the need for a new Marshall Plan It is the context of such postpandemic economic challenges that might bring completely different priorities to all of us Also certain interest groups who have hugely benefited from the old normal might resist to such a change process For example they might use the size of economic challenges as an excuse for not wanting to grapple with those challenges in social and political arenas However the reasons that made the Marshall Plan a success story in the reconstruction and development of Europe in the aftermath of the WWII were the Plans ability to build a strategic vision for the continent and its engagement with difficult sociopolitical problems In other words the type of changes that most people are hoping for in terms of pushing our societies and policy makers for a better care of the environment and socioeconomic vulnerabilities wiser spending of public money better disaster management and overall good governance might not necessarily be happening To avoid this the public debate should be shaped in a way that the significance of a holistic approach to the problems will be the norm Universities and civil society organizations once again could play a key role in such a mission Finally the fields of disaster management humanitarian aid and peacebuilding are unfortunately full of lessons learnt type reports from many failures of humanity to prevent conflicts and genocide respond to refugee crises prepare for natural disasters and pandemics and build peace sustainably However humanity has a great ability to repeat the same mistakes in these fields not because we do not know what to do any better or there is a lack of studies on those past experiences In fact the reason we find ourselves in the same spot of failures repeatedly is due to the global injustices of decision making trade and finance We live in a structurally unfair world with deep gaps between haves and havenots Similarly to expect any major changes for the better in the aftermath of the COVID19 pandemic would actually require fundamental revisions in policy making and application Overall although hoping for the better is undeniably a good quality of human beings it can also be quite deceptive and therefore those positive changes that we expect as a result of this pandemic might just remain as unrealized expectations Alternatively we should be getting ready to make some fundamental changes Alparslan Özderdem is the Dean of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution George Mason University The Pentagon said on Aug 14 it was setting up a new

health system if there is a major outbreak When Nima Amraa returned to Gaza from neighbouring Egypt earlier this month she was surprised to learn she was being placed in a makeshift quarantine center set up by the ruling Hamas group But her initial jitters turned to fear when two fellow travelers in another facility tested positive for the coronavirus the first cases to be confirmed in Gaza Once there were cases of the virus spreading we started to feel afraid and disappointed Amraa a 30yearold journalist said by phone from quarantine where she has spent a week and a half sleeping in a room with five other women and sharing a bathroom The virus found a way into Gaza even though the Mediterranean enclave has been largely cut off from the world by an IsraeliEgyptian blockade since Hamas took control of it 13 years ago Yet the terrifying possibility of an outbreak in one of the world is most crowded territories 2 million people squeezed into an area twice the size of Washington DC does not seem to have registered fully Many in Gaza seem to accept Hamas assurances that the threat is contained Efforts under blockage In the meantime Hamas is racing to build two massive quarantine facilities hoping to prevent the disease from spreading and overwhelming Gaza is already shattered health system The construction was ordered after photos surfaced from makeshift centres mostly schools showing people celebrating birthday parties with visiting relatives food being delivered by volunteers and groups of people smoking water pipes together Amraa said it was immediately clear that the school where she was placed was not prepared to house so many people I was worried after seeing that we will sleep on mattresses on the floor and we will be six in one room she explained We eat together and there is no isolation She said she and her roommates take precautions such as avoiding direct contact and keeping their beds two meters apart from each other But that might not be enough to keep the virus from spreading Last week seven Hamas security guards who were in the facility housing the first two cases became infected themselves We have been very clear on how the quarantine facilities should look like and offer in terms of facilities and services and support said Dr Gerald Rockenschaub the World Health Organizations director in the Palestinian territories But this is obviously easier said than done in Gaza where there is substantial shortage in almost everything Although the movement in and out of Gaza has been heavily restricted since 2007 it is not cut off altogether The first two virus cases were men who had returned from a religious conference in Pakistan part of a wave of hundreds of returnees who were placed into quarantine No one knows how much farther the virus has spread Only 20 percent of the roughly 1700 people in quarantine have been tested Gaza is people live mainly in densely populated cities and refugee camps The health care system is in shambles a result of the blockade three wars between Hamas and Israel and chronic underfunding due to infighting between Hamas and the rival Palestinian Authority in the West Bank Gaza has only 60 breathing machines and all but 15 are already in use according to the WHO The agency has been assisting local health officials and has been working with Israeli authorities who have no direct contact with Hamas to import desperately needed equipment and supplies from international donors Fight against the virus in Gaza Most people infected by the virus experience only mild symptoms such as fever and cough and recover within a few weeks But the virus can cause severe illness and death particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems High rates of obesity smoking and stressrelated disorders appear to make Gazas population especially vulnerable Hamas has sought to beef up its quarantine efforts in recent days opening 18 additional facilities in clinics and hotels and declaring them offlimits It also has banned weekly street markets and shut down wedding halls cafes and mosques and extended quarantine periods by a week After seeing images of the makeshift facilities Hamas leader in Gaza Yehiyeh Sinwar ordered the groups military wing to build two new quarantine centers Situated on the territorys northern and southern borders they will be able to hold 1000 people The group expects them to be ready within a week The public seems to have been calmed by the Health Ministry claims that all virus patients are held in quarantine centers Despite the shutdown orders people still walk the streets and congregate around small coffee kiosks and noodle shops That could change if cases begin to spread Elsewhere people still held wedding parties in their homes after wedding halls closed Dr Yahia Abed an epidemiologist said the public is apparent lack of commitment to safety precautions is worrisome and that anyone who might have been exposed to the virus must go into full and enforceable isolation If God forbid people hid the fact that they had contact with the infected this will be very dangerous for an area like Gaza The epidemic will spread said Abed a public health professor at Al Quds university near Jerusalem One factor in the small number of cases so far could be the lack of testing COGAT the Israeli defence body responsible for Palestinian civilian issues said it has coordinated the delivery of hundreds of coronavirus testing kits by the World Health Organization as well as protective equipment medicine and disinfectant Israel along with most of its Western allies considers Hamas a terrorist group But it likely fears the fallout from a catastrophic outbreak would spill over the frontier Qatar which provides extensive humanitarian aid to Gaza has also stepped in pledging 150 million in aid and providing furniture clothes and electrical appliances for the quarantine centers The Gaza Health Ministry says it urgently needs more than 20 million to stave off the collapse of the health system if there is a major outbreak Rockenschaub said there is still time to improve quarantine procedures in Gaza The issue is to move quickly and mobilise support to get them on the way to meet the right international standards he said

pandemic within their borders hundreds of thousands of people displaced due to humanitarian crises across the world have been left to fend for their own health during the outbreak This year the World Refugee Day may thus have taken on a new dimension marking a pandemic of poverty facing all displaced people around the world Many international humanitarian organizations warn that problems refugees face in accessing information amid language barriers and other obstacles between earning their livelihoods have gotten worse with the outbreak These new conditions have made their fragile financial difficulties all the more visible Yet during this challenging time the world has witnessed crossborder solidarity with refugees The UN Refugee Agency has confirmed this saying that host communities especially those in low and middleincome countries where nearly 90 of the world is refugees live have continued to demonstrate a remarkably welcoming attitude Despite often living in hard conditions refugees themselves have struggled shouldertoshoulder with their host communities contributing to the fight against the virus in significant ways Some for instance have volunteered as front line healthcare workers in Colombia and the UK while others are making soap in to be distributed in Lebanon and Niger and sewing masks and protective gear in Iran and Turkey So the pandemic has had a similarly negative impact on people from both refugee and host communities Yet it seems now have greater difficulties such as accessing basic needs and job opportunities According to the UNHCR this is the reason why it is now equally critical to secure refugees and displaced persons inclusion in the muchneeded socioeconomic response to the COVID19 Social economic inclusion Sibel Guven an expert at the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey TEPAV said Syrian refugees in Turkey had lost a substantial amount of income since the beginning of the outbreak citing recent surveys carried out on the group is socioeconomic situation About 40 of those who have responded to the survey are Syrians and when asked whether there was a change in their income about 70 of them stated their incomes had drastically changed she explained Social distancing measures are thought to have slowed down social and economic life and completely halted activities in some sectors When we look at the numbers we see that around 59 of Syrians living in Turkey are earning their lives by working said Guven This is the reason why unemployment among refugees could be one of the biggest challenges for Turkey is refugee and migrant population of over 5 million of which 36 million are Syrian Referring to the survey she added that almost 58 of those living in Turkey were between the ages of 15 and 34 and about 60 were primary school graduates But the very important thing is that about 70 of them have at least 10 years of experience working in a job back in Syria and about 93 say they have a profession in that sense she noted Guven underlined that Turkey had not been ready for the huge influx of migrants when they first began arriving at its borders in the early 2010s but gradually took measures to legally and socially integrate them into the society Yet when you look at the numbers you will see that we are not really using the Syrian employees skills she noted She added that among those who said they had a profession in Syria about 55 had been working in a job in Turkey before the coronavirus Refugees income loss Guven said that with the virus such Syrians faced additional difficulties in accessing the labor market and this could be a huge problem in terms of their survival and livelihoods adding that concrete action was needed to counter this trend But an important thing to note is that due to the pandemic most national and international nongovernmental organizations operating in the field of migration had suspended all facetoface interventions including social cohesion activities So it seems the current circumstances will necessitate a refocusing on social cohesion efforts which had not been included as urgent priorities in the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan 3RP in cooperation with public institutions and local authorities Misinformation to discrimination Omar Kadkoy a policy analyst at TEPAV also shared his comments focusing on the socioeconomic features of forcibly displaced populations Turkey had always been sending more immigrants than receiving them he noted saying that throughout the last 100 years refugees in Turkey had largely been of Turkish heritage and descent in one way or another through from former Ottoman territories He added that now millions of people from different groups were spread across the country and sharing public schools hospitals workplaces and companies with Turks These groups of displaced people have not integrated as well as was desired mainly because of the language barrier that prevented them from communicating with their host society This is a problem after almost 10 years that is still persistent and it is hindering integration at so many different levels he said In addition to this the circulation of misinformed news regarding Syrians on social media outlets damages the integration process Kadkoy explained Not only the refugees but also the host community should integrate he said This certainly does not mean that they should learn Arabic but they should at least be aware of false information of Syrians for example how they are getting this aid why this aid is presented to them from which institutions It seems the development of the dialogue between the two sides is very dependent on the solution of this problem COVID19 hits refugees pockets amid struggle to survive

down from 900 in February to nearly 90 this week South Korea has been showing that a different approach without a national or regional lockdown and an entry ban could be an effective way to fight against COVID19 the countrys ambassador to Turkey Choi Hongghi has told the Hürriyet Daily News When was the first case detected and what is the current situation of the pandemic in South Korea As the

has been in close contact with the confirmed cases Rather than waiting for patients to come in the government pursued and tracked down possible patients to prevent the spread within the community More than 400000 tests with positivity rate 24 percent have been performed to date at 635 testing sites including drivethru clinics and 118 laboratories nationwide It is also the main factor behind Koreas low mortality rate of 159 percent When cases are confirmed the government promptly conducts epidemiological investigations to track infection sources and screen contacts Especially the government thoroughly identifies the whereabouts of confirmed cases based on their credit card use history CCTV as well as mobile phone location and discloses them to prevent additional infections though without exposing any personal information What is the main approach your government has adopted From an early stage of the outbreak the Korean government has set key principles to combat COVID19 Openness transparency and keeping the public informed Various aspects of information regarding COVID19 have been disclosed transparently and rapidly For example the travel histories of confirmed patients are being made public The government has maintained the policy of keeping the doors open without an entry ban Furthermore no national or regional lockdown has been implemented The Korean government firmly believes that this policy is needed to minimize COVID19s negative repercussions on the world and the domestic economy For that reason the president of Korea Moon Jaein proposed in the G20 summit last Thursday to adopt conditional exemption of entry ban allowing for the travel essential persons such as businesspeople medical professionals and scientists with medical certificates showing negative test results When do you think this outbreak would be totally defeated in your country By observing that there is a stabilizing trend of newly confirmed cases most people of Korea are becoming confident that the current approach and measurement of the government are working and are hoping that Korea will fully overcome COVID19 soon However the government believes that now is not the time for being complacent and thus is maintaining its vigilance as new sporadic group infections continue along with the recent rise in the number of imported cases Is your government in cooperation with other nations in fighting COVID19 The Drivethru Testing Station that the Korean government has pioneered has been adopted by many countries including the US Germany and UK The government is committed to its contribution to global efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID19 Korea is becoming a major supplier of some devices especially COVID19 test kits As more than 100 countries in need of test kits and other items have sought to import them or receive them as humanitarian aid the government is working closely with several private producers to meet the global demand coronavirus

to capture the capital Tripoli and it continues despite the coronavirus pandemic and the ceasefire attempts The intense cargo flights of the United Arab Emirates UAE and Russia to the east of Libya since January 2020 hinted that a great war was just around the corner despite the ongoing negotiations regarding the political solutions and ceasefire In conclusion the Libyan National Army LNA loyal to the putschist General Khalifa Haftar started attacking Tripoli again on February 28 following the intensive replenishment of their military supplies The forces of the Government of National Accord GNA fighting for the Operation Volcano of Rage on the other hand launched Operation Peace Storm in the morning of March 25 against the Tripoli blockade on all fronts Thus the GNA shifted to attacking instead of defending for the second time after Gharyan Several questions arise on the ongoing process of the escalating war based on the observation that the war has been stuck on the same fronts for a very long time What happens on the ground whether there will be a major change or not and what the potential scenarios are based on new developments are among the questions that are at the forefront Led by the series of diplomatic initiatives taken Libya essentially entered 2020 with hopes for a political solution Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who signed two delimitation agreements with the GNA in November and Russian President Vladimir Putin who had been directly involved with the war through the Wagner Group since September 2019 brought together the sides on Jan 12 in Moscow for a political solution While the GNA Prime Minister Fayez alSarraj signed the ceasefire Haftar left Moscow without signing the text Shortly after the negotiations in Moscow German Chancellor Angela Merkel held the Berlin Conference on Jan 19 in Berlin with the participation of the main international actors to determine the roadmap of the political solution and meetings started in Geneva within the framework of a 55article communique For the realization of these meetings three separate meeting tables military economic and political were set up under the leadership of the United Nations To establish a permanent ceasefire in Libya negotiations started with joint military committee meetings in a 55 format The meetings of political table which were planned to start on Feb 26 failed In those days the GNA announced that the UAE had been sending weapons to Libya since midJanuary and it carried out approximately 100 flights to support the Haftarled LNA sending them an estimated 6200 tons of arms and military ammunition The flights are known to have departed from the Sweihan Air Base in the UAE and an air base in Assab Eritrea Feb 28 was the date that the alreadyviolated ceasefire had practically ended and that Hafter is LNA began mounting their attacks on Tripoli Likewise Ghassan Salame special representative of the UN secretary general and head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya also stated that there were violations of the ceasefire in Libya and warned that the ceasefire could be broken entirely Following the attacks on Tripoli and the Geneva talks losing their value Salame who had been in office for over two years announced his resignation in March stating that he is no longer able to maintain his health due to the stressors of his job However Salame is resignation was not enough to encourage an international initiative to be taken to stop the attacks on Tripoli either Similarly a humanitarian call for a ceasefire supported by the US many European countries Turkey and the UAE due to the COVID19 pandemic was made Though the call was initially accepted this ceasefire was immediately violated Just last week the LNA bombed a hospital aiming to treat COVID19 patients twice The ongoing missile attacks combined with the water and power outages in the capital make it impossible for the people of Tripoli to fight the coronavirus What is happening on the ground We have stated that the LNA has resumed its attacks on Tripoli as of Feb 28 While these attacks continue on many fronts especially in Ain Zara one of the main aims of the LNA is attacks was to test the GNA forces on the Gharyan Zuwarah Zawiya and other fronts with missile and cannon shots especially to figure out the weaknesses of its defense Also the attacks which targeted the military capacity obtained by the military aid provided by Turkey since January focused on Mitiga and Tripoli airports and ports Grad rocket attacks targeting the Mitiga airport on Jan 22 continued in the following months as well Similarly the Port of Tripoli was exposed to missile attacks to prevent incoming aid In contrast the GNA was also trying to strengthen the fronts to break the blockade it was in and especially sending military support to Jadu region in the Nafusa Mountains to eliminate the threat on southeast Tripoli The military capacity of GNA especially in the fields of air defense and air attack was increased with the newly obtained military aid in addition to the intensification of military coordination and supply to strengthen the fronts Making progress within the country since 2014 the LNA held the air superiority thanks to the drone fleet and air support with fighter jets provided by the UAE via the alKhadim air base as well as the air defense systems provided by Russia Since April 2019 the LNA had been in a very advantageous position on land as well thanks to the Sudanese Chadian and Russian mercenaries in addition to the weapons provided by their allies the UAE and Russia The UAE had built the alKhadim air base situated 170 kilometers 105 miles east of Benghazi which supported Hafter is forces since 2016 It was previously confirmed that Hawk air defense systems as well as Russian and Frenchmade fighter jets were installed at the air base The UAE had also supplied the Chinesemade Wing Loong II SIHA fleet to the LNA These Wing Loongs were used in night raids which resulted in major civilian casualties in Tripoli The LNA maintained its air superiority over the GNA forces with the air support provided by the UAE However the military support provided to the GNA by Turkey following the signing of the security accord between Turkey and Libya in November 2019 increased the military capacity of the GNA and more importantly allowed it to gain the air superiority Especially the radar and air defense systems frequencysignal mixing devices and night vision devices given to Tripoli following January 2020 blinded the air forces of the LNA and the UAE and made it difficult for the UAE to perform air operations with warplanes For this reason the attacks have been carried out in the form of bombardments with Grad rockets and other land shots since January However these changes in the field bring with themselves the consequence of the LNA not being able to prevent the missiles sent through the land which aim at the central Tripoli These attacks cause civilian casualties to increase In addition to this the progress made by the LNA on the Ain Zara front even if it is small has nonetheless increased the pressure on the GNA The GNA forces launched counterattack with Operation Peace Storm on Jan 25 to break the blockade of Tripoli and carried out an operation against the LNAcontrolled alWatiya air base Situated 60 km 37 mi south of Jadu in the Nafusa Mountains where the GNA has been using intensively to take on military supplies the alWatiya air base has been under the control of the LNA forces since August 2014 The control of the air base was gained by the the GNA forces briefly in April 2019 but they lost shortly after The alWatiya air base located in the southwest of the capital Tripoli and being the second most strategic base is seen as a priority target by the GNA This is because it is the replenishment center for the LNA facades in the west wing of Tarhuna and Tripoli In return the LNA carried out air operations to the military targets in the Nalut region located on the west end of the Nafusa Mountains to prevent the GNA support to Jadu Built on a flat area the alWatiya air base is a difficult target to defend rather than capture The LNA succeeded in defending alWatiya post2014 thanks to its foreign alliances especially the UAE However the GNA seeks to take control of the AlWatiya air base with the air superiority it now has and to cut the connection between the southern and western fronts making progress on both fronts The GNA captured the alWatiya air base in a short amount of time on Jan 25 but lost control of the airbase on the same day due to the insufficient number of troops advancing by land despite the air support It seems that the main reason for this retreat was that the forces which were expected to participate in the attack coming from the different fronts backed down at the last minute The LNA which regained the control of the alWatiya made rapid progress at the western gate of Tripoli with a counterattack and also captured Riqdalin alIsa alAjaylat Zliten Sabratah and Surman Proceeding to the Tunisian border gate in the westernmost part the LNA blockaded the GNA forces in Ra is Ajdir where the border gate is located but is currently continuing the blockade without armed conflict to avoid any possible tension with Tunisia Zuwarah an important Amazigh city on the western coastline of the country is also under blockade similar to Ra is Ajdir On April 13 the GNA forces launched an attack to seize Sabratah and Surman after the LNA which was advancing on the west wing started to build a military heap on this front although it was in the region with a limited military presence The operation started with airstrikes Riqdalin alIsa alAjaylat Zliten Sabratah and Surman were recaptured after being lost in the first two days of the operation The land connection was reestablished with Ra is Ajdir where the border gate is located The attacks targeting the alWatiya airbase are continuing Clashes are continuing intensely on the southwestern front The Abu Salim neighborhood located on the axis of Ain Zara is one of the regions that are heavily targeted by the LNA attacks since the start of the war in April 2019 It has seen that the LNA has failed to make any progress in their quest to capture central Tripolis for over a year while the GNA caused major losses to the LNA via air operations However the GNA still has to regain the control of Terhune for the elimination of this threat on this front Another critical front is the eastern wing which is directly affecting the security of Misrata While the GNA aims to recapture the city of Sirte which has fallen under the control of the LNA as a result of tribes and the militia switching sides the LNA is looking to enter Misrata through Zamzam Valley and the Abu Qurayn region On the other hand developments on this front stand out in terms of GNA is air superiority On March 27 the LNA forces marching through the land were repelled by the GNA Following that Sirte Operations Room was shot on March 28 in an air attack targeting the strategic units west of Sirte and highlevel names from the LNA were killed The LNA took a big hit with this attack which killed Sirte Operations Room Commander MajorGeneral Salem Driaq his assistant Gaddafi alSadai Rabea elFercani Salim elTavergi and Hamid elShaeri Besides on April 12 the GNA military spokesman Col Tayyar Muhammad Qanunu announced that one MI35 helicopter and two LNAowned Wing Loong II SIHAs were downed during the operations carried out in the Abu Qurayn region The battle for superiority on air Air superiority remains the most important factor in determining how the war will continue The GNA increasing its military capacity following the signing of the security accord between Libya and Turkey and especially having access to airstrike and defense systems now seems to have made it even less feasible for the LNA to reach their goal since Hafter is forces have not been able to conquer Tripolis in over a year Operation Peace Storm initiated by the GNA under the command of Mj Gen Osama alJuwaili aims to progress on all fronts west south and east thereby breaking the blockade of Tripoli The GNA is seeking to carry out operations on the LNAcontrolled air bases and wear down the military forces there As part of these goals the GNA is short term military goals are observed to be seizing the alWatiya air base and breaking the supply line between Terhune and the western fronts moving towards Terhune and eliminating the LNA threat on the southern front making progress in Sirte on the western front and ensuring the security of Misrata On the other hand it is important whether the UAE warplanes especially the Mirages at the alKhadim air base will participate in air operations or not Also there are rumors that the LNA bought the Frenchmade air defense missiles Mistral MANPADS to destroy the air superiority achieved by the GNA While it is yet to be known whether these rumors are true or not the LNA will likely take steps toward destroying the air superiority of the GNA The struggle for air superiority also contributes to the crystallization of the multidimensional structure of the international struggle that continues in Libya Although the support provided by the UAE Egypt and Russia to Haftar and the LNA is more prominent the military supplies gathered through the advancements in the western front by the GNA has brought the Israeli connection in the Libyan war to the agenda during the superiority in the air battle Allegations that the UAE sent the LNA advanced air defense systems produced by an Israeli company through Egypt suggests that the tension will not be decreasing in Libya anytime soon Opinions expressed in this article are the author is own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu Agency Nebahat Tanriverdi Yasar an independent

coronavirus for the last couple of months While more than 17100 people have lost their lives over 392300 people were directly affected by the virus Besides its influences on human life and health sector it is necessary to mention that this outbreak which has turned into a pandemic would also have a lot of consequences in terms of politics It is one of the important findings of the social sciences that such unexpected events that upset the lives of masses overwhelm the established forms of policymaking and enable the transition to new political discourses and practices In this article we aim to assess what kind of outcomes the COVID19 outbreak would give birth in the political field in both short and medium terms It is possible to classify these assessments after first examining how COVID19 outbreak affects generalnormal ways of doing politics we set the analysis in three phases Specific state example regional orders global power struggle New normal Technopolitics COVID19 epidemic not only threatens human health but also undermines social and political patterns Firstly COVID19 has a characteristic to inhibit politics The most important reason for this is the conflict between the traditional logic of politics which discriminates between friends and enemies and healthbased technopolitics This dispute also influences the decisionmaking dynamics The socialeconomic decisions about the future of a country are now left to the privatetechnical information regimes and representatives COVID19 outbreak has demonstrated that the political reflexes introduced at first are dramatically dysfunctional and a new style of politics which prioritizes technologytechnical information replaces it It is one of the most striking examples of how a scientific report in Britain forced a rightwing populist power to take a stand In the UK Boris Johnson is government initially adopted the policy of spreading the virus using initiative and taking political risk but quickly switched to a policy of suppressing the virus based on a new report of scientists from Imperial College It is remarkable in this sense that the policy on the virus outbreak in Turkey which has not made this mistake has been left to the skills of a science board since the beginning Another important example in this sense is how the successful crisis management of the minister of health a physician has made the current political power more acceptable even in the eyes of the opponents Secondly civil society and solidarity politics all over the world are being replaced by policies of strict controls which make hillbilly and social isolation a priority This is also a development closely related to the political technique Indeed the introduction of politics into a technopolitical form not only pushes the average citizen further out of the corporate politics but also challenges preliminary assumptions about the functioning and nature of the state This new form makes the state that holds devices of controlling healthtechnical regimes even more advantageous to the individual The society which is trying to find its way between the faltering economic structure and the volatile political practices is becoming more confused Society can find no other way than to surrender itself to this language and politics of health which is emerging as a new ideological device This new form is radical and jarring Because unlike certain ideological devices it appears in ways that do not cling to the culturetradition or even to the possibilities of reproduction such as the fetish of consumption For example it is not only the restrictions on mosque and Friday prayers but the fact that congregational worship and other social practices will likely not take place during the upcoming Ramadan as a result Thirdly there is a leap in social formation and communication shifting to more virtual realms The mediocrity which ideology calls the individual as the subject is disappearing The fact that the school the most important medium of social reproduction is shifting to the digital space by changing form and content heralding a radical change While this is a trend we have been experiencing for a long time with the recent global COVID19 epidemic the traditional mechanisms of socialization that have taken the individual from teacherstudent relationship to Sunday shopping are seriously shaken Another consequence of this new state is that it is easier to control individual opportunities and initiatives in one direction With the coronavirus epidemic crisis the increase of false communication and the shift to urgentalarmist sectoral language with virtual communication which liberal capitalism has blessed as the possibility of freedom from the state make the future of social movements more pessimistic The future of the European Union The European Union is one of the regional blocs that suffer the most from the epidemic It continues to display an inability to use the common good and public benefit in crises one of its most fundamental claims since the Cold War Recently with the rise of the radical right in Europe identity politics has gained a considerable momentum and farright parties have become the partners in power either directly or by likening mainstream parties to themselves In addition to breaking down the identity of the Union it can be said that the first political trend that COVID19 will displace is the farright identity politics However the disruption of identity politics in addition to the UK example and other examples we have mentioned does not mean that the union will save the future Because technopolitics which replaces identity politics also prefers the closure of territorial and social borders The fact that each country makes its own health issue a priority eliminates the politicaleconomic integrity and solidarity that are the most important engine of the EU In short the EU which has been destroyed by the identity politics continues to be destroyed by the new isolationist dynamics of technopolitics even if identity politics loses its position Disaster in Iran Some countries experiences give significant clues about the direction of the world politics Especially the COVID19 experience in Iran has characteristics worthy of note China just like Iran has an authoritative regime type On the other hand remarkable differences between Iran and China have occurred during the crisis In the COVID19 epidemic Iran which has a theocratic form of government engaged in identity politics and lied to its people paving the way for a major disaster As a result of this religiousidentity politics Iran has not interfered for long for example with people from Qom nor has it delayed in taking the necessary measures to combat the new type of coronavirus outbreak China on the other hand used its authoritarianism as a means of settlement politics at the time of crisis and prevented the spread of the virus with rapid onthespot measures Therefore it turned out that authoritarian governments which operate through technical devices instead of authoritarian governments built through identity intervene in crises much more effectively Another fact demonstrated by the Iranian experience is that the US does not ease Iranian embargoes despite all the calls from the world and may even consider military intervention in Iran in the process This shows more clearly how the new politics of hegemony imposed by the US President Donald Trump would take shape at a time of crisis The new image of the US which relentlessly maintains its embargo policy on Iran which is experiencing a major health crisis as a country gives no confidence to anyone There is an image of an opportunistic hegemon who does not accept any humanitarian perspective as a reference using even a deep health crisis as a leverage against opponents With this approach the image of the US which does not trust even its allies has been strengthened It should not be forgotten that in this global health crisis the US failed not only its rivals like Iran but also an allies like Italy by ignoring their calls for help Ironically China rushed to Italy is aid which gives some details about China is new hegemony politics US and its displeased allies The US has for some time entered into a new nationalist foreign policy line with the Trump administration with the motto sharing costs assigning responsibility to its allies in the face of international problems The first consequence of this new form of governance is that the cost of being allied with the US has increased Until the recent crisis the US allies had not yet been able to test what gains they had in return from sharing costs The first serious test took place in the face of the COVID19 outbreak and the US preferred to close its borders to them rather than supporting its allies for example in the face of Italy is dramatic calls for help The normality of the American order seeking a solution in greater isolation has now vanished in the eyes of its allies Moreover the enormous incompetence and the indifferent approach to solving the COVID19 crisis in his home country has greatly undermined the USs ability and legitimacy to be a superpower How sustainable is the costly alliance of the US which despite its advanced technology and kits to test for COVID19 disease is incapable of supplying itself and its allies The experience of the COVID19 pandemic also signals a new hardening in ChinaUS global competition In response to China is deporting of US journalists one by one Trump is America persistently describes the virus as a Chinese virus preferring to take positions both inside and outside However even during the Cold War the US and the Soviet Union were able to set aside global competition and develop a common policy against problems such as smallpox The experience of a new type of coronavirus outbreak therefore shows that in this new era the competition between the great powers can be brutal and without exception The rivalry of these two great powers who are expected to carry out cooperation with global responsibility consciousness firsthand in times of crisis is damaging to the whole world Financial superiority of China China appears to have snatched from America its role as the compassionate leading country that benefits the public on a global scale It has also managed to make Wuhan forget the responsibility of having hidden the outbreak which began in November 2019 for months Well how does it do this As the crisis of COVID19 epidemic emerged China had two important advantages diplomatic and financial Firstly the advantage of experience gained by having experienced the epidemic and stopping it to a considerable extent It reaches out to tens of countries through diplomatic channels and video conferences making critical information sharing in the fight against the epidemic and conveying its experiences The second is the advantage of providing financial and technical information to countries struggling with the epidemic after being out of the vortex of the epidemic China has already begun delivering disease testing kits to a wide geography plagued by the epidemic Moreover it does this as a donation through Ali Baba one of the most important global trade networks It also skillfully advertises tens of thousands of masks ventilators and test kit assistance it has made to many countries in Africa and especially in Italy Of course through these new political techniques China is crisis management will have serious repercussions in the world politics China which solved the COVID19 epidemic by leaning on maximum technology is imposing its own model to the whole world as the epidemic becomes acute Many of the normally frightening instruments such as the mapping of names caught with Covid19 disease and the elimination of the possibility of contact with noninfected people are now becoming the mechanisms the world desires to prevent the spread of the epidemic In addition to this material superiority it is not yet clear whether China will be able to seize the moralpsychological superiority in the world politics On the other hand it is necessary to note that it has put great effort in this regard It spreads propaganda that the virus was brought to China from outside and it is an opportunity for its opponents to manage the crisis inexorably Not only does the EU and especially the US help the world but it also makes it easier for China to do anything other than stand in its own way and wait Ali Balci is a political scientist at Sakarya University in Turkey is Black Sea region Tuncay Kardas is director of the Middle East Institute of Sakarya

some goodwill No country in the Middle East has suffered more from Covid19 Coronavirus than Iran where this terrifying pandemic has resulted in 988 reported deaths according to government sources Unfortunately it is a safe bet that Irans actual Covid19 death toll is higher perhaps by a lot Outside of China Qom is one of the diseases largest outbreak centres The main reason why has to do with the Iranian holy citys links to China that span across numerous sectors Chinas heavy footprint in Iran which Shireen Hunter suggested risks making Iran a Chinese colony has largely resulted from the Trump administrations maximum pressure campaign pushing Tehran further into Beijings geopolitical and economic orbits Yet as Sanam Vakil explained Irans trading partner of last resort proved to be a very toxic bomb that has spread Covid19 to all of Irans 31 provinces Coronavirus has also infected scores of government and military officials including First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri Largely due to the Iranian governments vested interests in avoiding panic throughout the country officials in Tehran hid information about the diseases outbreak in the country The government publicly announced the news of Covid19 hitting Iran only several hoursbefore some of the virus first Iranian victims were announced dead underscoring how the regime responded slowly and allowed the virus to spread before openly addressing the crisis Authorities reportedly arrested certain citizens who had raised alarm about the disease in Iran Clearly the government was more focused on controlling the transmission of information about the epidemic than the epidemic itself Kamiar Alaei and Arash Alaei who both previously work as doctors in Iran recently argued in the New York Times that this is what happens when you make health policy subservient to politics Also certain clerics in Qom made matters far worse by refusing to obey the governments commands to shut down the shrines for several days after the discovery of Covid19 in Iran last month Footage shared on social media by Masih Alinejad a US governmentcontracted activist shows worshippers licking holy shrines in Qom and elsewhere in Iran This activity occurred despite the Health Ministrys orders to not touch or kiss any of the shrines The government reportedly plans to jail and flog the two men found guilty of disobeying such orders Authorities in the Islamic Republic are now taking coronavirus extremely seriously Iran has shut down its flights to China at least most of them as well as schools and universities nationwide Drones are flying throughout the country to disinfect streets Between Irans cities there are checkpoints aimed at containing the diseases spread Yet there is no doubt that the ruling Iranian elites inertia corruption and mismanagement played a big role in Irans Covid19 crisis Having said that much blame belongs on Washingtons doorstep too The Trump administrations policies are preventing firms from selling testing kits ventilators and other badly needed equipment to Iran because they do business through financial institutions that will not carry the payments as a result of the sanctions As Irans foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif put it US sanctions have made Iran the victim of medical terrorism In a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres Zarif said that sanctions preventing Iran from selling oil as well as bankinginsurance sanctions have left his country unable to sufficiently provide its citizens with necessary medicine medical supplies and humanitarian goods Iran recently asked the International Monetary Fund IMF for USD 5 billion bailout to help the government battle coronavirus The extent to which the IMF helps Iran will say much about how sincere the DCheadquartered institution is in terms of its rhetoric about helping countries across the world fight Covid19 Many questions remain open about whether the IMF will approve this aid to Iran and if the banks involved will overcome their fears of US sanctions to move ahead with the transfer of funds to Iran It is clear that the Trump administrations indiscriminate financial warfare against Iran violates the Iranian peoples right to health and without Washington changing its course more Iranians will face the extra challenges of containing coronavirus as sanctions continue strangling their country New opportunities amid crisis It is important for the US administration to recognise an opportunity for Washington to earn some good will among Iranians and begin gradually improving bilateral relations It would behoove US policymakers to accept the fact that maximum pressure has failed miserably in terms of its objectives Put simply this US campaign against Iran has not pressured Tehran into changing its conduct exemplified by Irans continued support for regional groups opposed by Washington as well as the countrys recent nuclear activities The pandemic however provides Washington with an offramp from USIran brinkmanship Although the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani at the beginning of this year has made diplomacy between Washington and Tehran increasingly difficult to imagine the Covid19 crisis could give the US an opportunity to secure the release of American hostages in exchange for humanitarian assistance to Iran Although it would be naïve to think that such progress could easily quickly or even inevitably solve all the outstanding problems in USIran relations it could be a good start As one of Trumps Republican predecessors in the White House George H W

model in the fight against COVID19 after its appearance in the city of Wuhan in December Some western countries like the US have been criticized for being too harsh but China has succeeded in reducing the number of cases with this model As a city of approximately 11 million Wuhan has been isolated from the outside world since Jan 23 Following these measures taken at the expense of peoples livelihoods and personal freedoms travel restrictions have recently begun to ease in some cities of Hubei province except Wuhan In an interview with Hürriyet Daily News Chinese Ambassador to Ankara Deng Li said the provinces in the mainland of the country except Hubei have reduced the number of new diagnoses and suspicious cases to zero and production and living conditions are rapidly returning to normal throughout the country Currently China is putting all its weight on preventing cases from abroad However Ambassador Deng emphasizes that China cannot be said to have triumphed unless the world pandemic ends He noted that scientists in China stated that the outbreak can be expected to end in June if the countries take effective action What are the issues that Turkey and China make cooperation in in the struggle against COVID19 What assistance have Turkey and China provided to each other The COVID19 outbreak is a common and new test that all humanity faces Relevant countries should overcome this challenge in cooperation by joining hands The Turkish side sent two batches of medical supplies to China to fight the pandemic In a friendly attitude the Chinese side effectively and in a constructive manner coordinated Turkeys humanitarian and evacuation operations of its citizens from Wuhan The Chinese side has closely been following Turkeys fight against the pandemic At the request of the Turkish side China continues its cooperation in issues such as test kits medicine and experience sharing According to Turkish media reports rapid test kits and drugs imported from China are already being used The organizations and individuals in Turkey affiliated with China have immediately taken action and donated several medical supplies such as mask and surgical overalls Do the

healthcare professionals from both sides Chinese scientists shared all their experiences including the treatment plan on the matter and answered questions posed by Turkish experts Could you give information about the drug that was announced by Health Minister Fahrettin Koca imported from China What is the name of this drug How is the method of use What is your success regarding the treatment

Shenzhen cities and showed a positive clinical effect Favipiravir which has a certain and positive effect according to the clinical tests of Chinese experts is reliable and does not show any specific negative side effects preventing the condition of patients with mild symptoms from getting worse Experts advised to include Favipiravir in the treatment plan Our embassy has no knowledge of the method of use and its effect We believe that Chinese and Turkish healthcare professionals will exchange ideas on these issues How many quantities did Turkey purchase of this drug Do you have enough production capacity to continue to meet this demand To which other countries do you export I think it would be better to refer to the company of order or to the Turkish Health Ministry to learn about Turkeys order Our embassy has no information about production capacity and sales status Could you give information about the stage you have reached in the fight against Chinas COVID19 cases What is the latest situation in the pandemics spread chart in the country What is the main approach your government has adopted in combating the epidemic What are the strengths and weaknesses of your approach After the COVID19 outbreak the Chinese government is fighting the pandemic with all its efforts under the determined leadership of President Xi Jinping putting an open transparent and responsible attitude putting peoples safety and health first mobilizing the whole country and at this stage made gains In the mainland of China provinces outside of Hubei province have reduced the number of new diagnoses and suspected cases to zero As of March 27 299 of the 337 cities in which case was detected the number of cases was reduced to zero While the course of the fight against the pandemic is getting well the production and living conditions are rapidly returning to normal Currently China is putting all its weight on preventing cases from abroad As of March 27 0000 the total number of detected cases from abroad was 595 What are your recommendations to the Turkish authorities and citizens in the fight against the pandemic If correct perspectives are created and correct methods are used the COVID19 virus can be prevented controlled and beaten All countries and individuals should do their best with sufficient confidence The Chinese side follows the principle of Four Early in the fight against epidemics Early diagnosis early reporting early isolation and early treatment In this way we can cut the virus spreading channel as soon as possible and allocate health resources to those who really need it In the face of a new virus which has an extremely high transmission rate not only the efforts of the healthcare professionals are sufficient but the whole society must act against it Staying at home can also be an indispensable contribution to combating the pandemic How was the Chinese economy affected by this pandemic Can you give information about your economy supportrecovery package The risks of the Chinese economy going down is increasing due to the effects of many domestic and international factors The pandemic hit hard the functioning of the economy But in general the tendency of the Chinese economy to improve in the long run and to go up domestically has not changed The effects of the outbreak are shortterm and external controllable In the first two months the total production volume of the industry sector at the scales determined by the state in China reached 115 trillion RMB the sales amount of social consumption products exceeded 52 trillion RMB and the realized capital investments exceeded 33 trillion RMB These show that the Chinese economys supersize advantage has not changed While having difficulty in other industries demands for new services such as online shopping fresh food ecommerce platforms online education remote inspection remote work are increasing rapidly while the production amount of high technology products is rapidly increasing These show that the momentum of the new driving forces has not changed and China can turn the shortterm pressures into an engine power of the transformation process After strengthening our successful position in the fight against the epidemic the inner motives of the development of China will emerge more and more the restart button and the acceleration button will be pressed for some economic activities which were previously pressed the stop button What is your prediction for the total control and end of this pandemic in your country China cannot be said to have triumphed unless the world pandemic ends Leading healthcare professionals in China said that the outbreak could be expected to end in June if the countries concerned take effective action China is acting vigilantly and cautiously towards a second wave as the danger of virus carriers coming from abroad is increasing At this stage we will make great efforts on three issues First to treat 3460 existing cases especially 1034 patients with severe conditions Second to cut not only the humantohuman transmission channel of the virus but the animaltohuman transmission channel which is the source of the virus Third preventing the virus from coming abroad which is the most important issue at the moment Which countries is your government cooperating with in the fight against COVID19 Currently China is reaching out to countries affected by the pandemic in the following four areas First China aided 89 countries such as Iran Iraq Serbia Italy and Pakistan along with the World Health Organization WHO and the African Union for the test kits masks and protective clothing and donated 20 million to the WHO Secondly China has made more than 30 remote teleconference meetings with 180 countries and sent
