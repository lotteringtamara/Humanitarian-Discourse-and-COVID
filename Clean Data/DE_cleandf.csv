20200227_DE_DieWelt_FACTIVA15887.txt,Raw text/DEClean/20200227_DE_DieWelt_FACTIVA15887.txt,DE,DieWelt,20200227,4,Copyright 2020 Axel Springer SE The World Bank is pandemic bond is an indicator of the global danger of epidemics Now the interestbearing paper collapses Daniel Eckert und Holger Zschäitz Even among health experts it is controversial whether the rapid spread of the coronavirus is already a pandemic On the financial markets however the verdict is already clear The answer is yes This is indicated by the prices of socalled pandemic bonds The value of these special bonds has fallen this week to an average of 50 percent of their issue price The holders of the interestbearing securities must fear that the bonds will not be repaid This is precisely what happens when the conditions for a pandemic a worldwide disease are met The slide in the share price therefore signals that the probability of a global breakout is considered very high by capital market players Pandemic bonds were introduced by the World Bank in 2017 in response to the Ebola crisis in Africa The idea behind this was to provide poorer countries with sufficient capital in the event of a crisis in order to combat the epidemic in a targeted manner The capital in turn should be raised by private investors And so the World Bank subsidiary International Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued two tranches with a volume of 95 and 225 million dollars Investors were baited with a doubledigit coupon The only catch Should a pandemic with many deaths occur investors would only get back part of the money or in extreme cases would even have to write off their investment completely Because then the capital paid in would flow directly to the nations in need of help not back to the investors The pandemic bond seemed to have benefits for all parties involved The bond promised the prospect of rapid financial aid in the event of a humanitarian crisis to countries that are plagued by an epidemic Issuer World Bank was able to insure a risk that no insurer would have taken on due to its lack of predictability and only had to pay interest as an insurance premium And it sounded like a good deal even for investors willing to take risks In any year in which there was no pandemic they would be able to earn doubledigit interest income and this in times of low capital market yields More than twelve percent of the 95 million tranche was sold In addition the bonds promised returns independent of other market developments The spread of a disease is usually an event that is not correlated with the economic and central bank cycle which in turn determines the ups and downs of the markets Such uncorrelated assets are extremely rare Accordingly both tranches of the pandemic bond were quickly oversubscribed at the time of the 2017 issue But the first blow came as early as 2018 The prices of the riskier 95 million tranche slipped to 70 percent of the nominal value The reason was an outbreak of Ebola in the Congo However the crisis did not take such a devastating course In the end the thresholds of the pandemic bond were not reached which would have meant funds for emergency monetary aid for the affected country but a loss of capital for investors For this to happen the terms of the bond require 250 deaths or more in one country and at least 20 in another and the disease must be established in different countries This is the critical point With the spread of the coronavirus Covid19 such a humanitarian disaster scenario no longer seems unlikely And so the prices of the bonds fall drastically However the bonds are not traded on public stock exchanges Pricing is not very transparent Only a few brokers specialize in trading the securities and even they are reluctant to quote publicly This is also due to the complicated conditions of the bonds The prospectus comprises almost 400 pages and contains numerous clauses The wording is so complicated that even wellinformed investors find it difficult to predict when the pandemic will occur For example the World Health Organization WHO must first publish a socalled storage report Thus the prices of the pandemic bond predict with a high degree of certainty the worldwide spread of Covid19 But they are not one hundred percent safe either There are always monsters under the bed sometimes they are real monsters and sometimes only perceived ones Mark Spitznagel of Universa Investments told financial service Bloomberg The hedge fund manager specializes in hedging rare risks that can result in high losses for investors According to the expert pandemic bonds are of little use because their value will fall if the financial markets collapse on a broad front for fear of the consequences of a possible pandemic Uncorrelated investments are now turning into highly vulnerable investments during the crisis Spitznagel does not want to commit himself to who is right in the case of Corona One can neither fully trust the markets which tend to panic and often overshoot up or down However public institutions and health experts are also often wrong when it comes to epidemics World Bank in Washington The institution has issued the bond Note This article has been translated automatically

real virus without an apparent cure Political deadlock violent repression and decades of corruption all outweigh fears of a transfer of the virus from Iran As Iraqi authorities confirmed the first coronavirusrelated death and at least 31 cases of COVID19 on Wednesday all traced to Iran the deepening political crisis is complicating efforts to tackle the virus in a country that is already particularly vulnerable Demonstrations that have already seen more than 600 people killed by thugs and security forces according to the Iraqi Commission for Human Rights entered their sixth month on Sunday A week after health authorities banned public gatherings in an effort to contain the virus protesters in Baghdad refused to leave Tahrir Square We see COVID19 as a small threat when we are being killed with guns and live bullets We have been facing death poverty and corruption since 2003 This is the real virus and I do not think we will find a cure activist and journalist Alqasem Ahmed said Despite determined efforts to contain the outbreak Iraq is health system has been undermined by decades of sanctions neglect and corruption and protest camps are exposed Health authorities hampered by neglected system Although Iraqi health authorities have been taking the threat of COVID19 seriously shortages in supplies equipment and staff and decades of sanctions and corruption have left the medical system in a shambles and are exacerbating the threat said Omar alDewachi a former doctor in Iraq who now specializes in the medical anthropology of the country at Rutgers University in the US Officials have banned public gatherings suspended work at some government ministries and ordered schools and restaurants in major cities to close World Health Organization WHO representative Adnan Nawar said the Health Ministry has been working shouldertoshoulder with the United Nations health agency providing detection kits and advice while hospitals have been equipped with isolation rooms But a recent Reuters report found that after years of war UN sanctions and corruption the medical system in general is suffering a crisis of neglect with doctors fleeing in their thousands a shortage of drugs and an allocated health budget of only 25 of the state is 1065 billion 958 billion revenue Activist Alqasem Ahmed said one suspected case had been turned away from two hospitals in Baghdad and a pharmacist in the city said people are worried about the Health Ministry is ability to effectively counter the coronavirus crisis Wamith Kassab said prices for masks and hand sanitizer were rising and hospitals in some places are lacking gloves and other preventative equipment Added to that many people are not observing basic advice issued by the government based on handwashing and minimizing physical contact Kassab said Shut the borders with Iran At the same time Iraq is close social economic and political ties with Iran leave the country at a heightened risk Iran currently has the world is highest number of deaths 92 from the virus outside China but the comparatively low number of reported cases in the country has raised questions about the extent to which information on the crisis is being withheld Read more Could Iran become a new coronavirus epicenter Iraqi authorities said they had closed the border with Iran and barred Iranians from entering before any Iraqi cases had been reported Iraqis arriving from Iran by land are also required to undergo a mandatory twoweek quarantine according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA Iran and Iraq share 21 official border crossings and the three significant Shia holy days in March would normally see large numbers of pilgrims crossing into Iraq by land But there have been conflicting reports about whether crossings between the two countries have been fully closed The Iranian ambassador to Baghdad initially denied the border was closed on February 20 and OCHA reported some people were attempting to be smuggled across Analysts have highlighted how the close interdependence between the two countries will make containing the spread from Iran difficult Sajad Jiyad from the Baghdadbased alBayan Center tweeted that an extended ban on Iranian arrivals would cause serious economic problems Many political factions in Iraq also share close ties with Iran something that has consistently raised the ire of protesters who resent what they see as a powerful Iranian influence in their country Im not really convinced that they are closing these borders correctly or doing the proper procedures Dewachi the medical anthropologist said Iraq is highly vulnerable because Iran is linked to these corrupt parties and it will not allow the government to actually close the border and try to contain the movement of people Local media reported protesters had blocked the road leading to one crossing in Diyala province last week for fear of the coronavirus spreading and a hashtag that translates as Shut the borders with Iran has trended on Twitter demonstrating protesters distrust of government assurances Read more What you need to know about the coronavirus Political and economic security trump virus concerns As business owners in Baghdad ignore the directive to close cafes clubs and malls and activists remain camped out Iraqis livelihoods security and political freedoms have trumped concerns of a severe outbreak Protesters who camp together in close quarters may be relatively more vulnerable but have adapted their own medical stations to distribute hygiene products and advice even as they tend to injuries sustained under tear gas and live fire during demonstrations Having recently visited a protest camp Dewachi said One of the deepest moments I had was when I heard two guys saying Well you can die this way or you can die that way They were referring to how in Iraq you are constantly confronting death Liberating yourself from all this political and social repression which is a form of death compared to staying at home being silent and dying from something else you might as well choose the better death Dewachi said I think the coronavirus is just another episode in what people are facing there Every day DW is editors send out a selection of the day is hard news and quality feature journalism

hospital beds and poor testing capacities in Africa make for a poor COVID19 prognosis To beat the pandemic countries on the continent need new strategies experts say Only half a hospital bed is what would be available to 1000 Nigerians in the event of an emergency At least that is the official figure put forward by the World Health Organization for Africa is most populous nation In Kenya the situation is marginally better with 14 beds per 1000 inhabitants The picture is even darker when it comes to beds in Intensive Care Units ICU 43 African countries combined have fewer than 5000 ICU beds according to the WHO That is about five beds per one million people Europe by comparison has 4000 beds per one million people The figures are terrifying in the face of a pandemic and as the coronavirus spreads in Africa However some medical experts have cast doubt on them and others say the numbers are out of date Nigeria is last hospital bed count dates back to 2005 whereas Kenya is was in 2010 The latest available information for Africa is from 2011 Read more COVID19 compounds Africa is preexisting health sector problems Few tests unreliable data It is already clear that the COVID19 pandemic stretches Africa is healthcare facilities to their limits In Kenya the health system which is severely stressed by diseases such as malaria cholera HIVAids is already overwhelmed by the crisis said Kathryn Täzsch of the humanitarian organization World Vision in Nairobi The number of patients in Kenya with potentially fatal pneumonia has been on the increase since January and is currently at just under 300 There are far too few beds in ICUs and the care for a patient including protective clothing costs 1200 1300 per day That is immense for one system that is already struggling with many problems Täzsch told DW The WHO has warned that subSaharan Africa could become the next epicenter of the pandemic The global health body is model calculations assume at least 300000 Africans could succumb to the virus and more than 30 million could slip into extreme poverty And there is another problem Test capacities are limited many countries have only now begun rolling out a few dozen tests Kenya started to do so just recently But the estimated number of unreported cases is much higher said Täzsch The situation is similar in Kano in northern Nigeria According to DW is correspondent Nasir Salisu Zango Doctors say the government is not prepared for the fight Nursing staff are not work properly because they do not want to put their lives at risk They fear greatly of being infected by patients Read more Coronavirus in slums Helpers left high and dry in infection hot spots No reliable sources This is also the conclusion reached by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine LSHTM The data on the number of people infected with the coronavirus and treatment capacities in Africa is very incomplete said Professor Francesco Checci This means that the number of those infected do not provide a very reliable source of how strongly the virus is being transmitted It is also difficult to determine to what extent clinics doctors and nurses can respond to the crisis Checci added Why is there no reliable data to assess the situation The health sector in subSaharan Africa is understaffed and poorly equipped so the starting point for data collection is very poor according to Checci Fortunately there are ways to work around the data shortage so that the WHO the African Union and African governments can make decisions You can use mathematical models to predict trends and choose strategies to respond to the crisis But that also has its own problems The current forecasts for the pandemic in Africa are based on evaluations of the COVID19 in Europe and China according to Checci In Africa however the situation could develop differently for example through more infections in urban poor areas than in rural areas In spite of all the uncertainty one thing is clear If we look at the prognosis for infections in Africa it is clear with a few exceptions like South Africa that we are standing in front of a huge mountain when we compare the expected critical cases with the available ICU beds Checci told DW Read more Coronavirus The lessons to learn from Ebola More emphasis on prevention The main focus of African governments is on the provision of better healthcare but Checci see that as problematic It is almost not feasible given the number of patients to be expected Nobody knows exactly to what extent Africa is prepared for the pandemic Therefore Checci sees prevention as the only sensible approach to reduce transmission of the coronavirus He believes that measures such as selfisolation social distancing and protecting highrisk groups should be made a priority If all three strategies are well combined and followed they will provide an opportunity for African governments to reduce the pressure on their healthcare systems and cut death tolls without months of curfews and the economic damage that could possibly be worse than the virus itself said Checci 53229698

pandemic Daniel Friedrich Sturm Washington Since June 2019 Sigmar Gabriel has been chairman of AtlantikBrüke The former foreign minister accuses the USA and Europe of global inactivity in the Corona crisis which one country in particular wants to use for its own benefit WORLD Mr Gabriel what did you think when Donald Trump speculated on disinfectants as a therapy against the corona virus Sigmar Gabriel That reality can still be worse than any satire imaginable There are no limits to this nonsense How dangerous are these statements As long as nobody tries these therapy suggestions it is just another bad joke Much more dramatic is the fact that the USA is failing as the leading nation In previous pandemic cases it was the USA that used its possibilities to help worldwide The West and its leading nation are currently a total failure China of all countries is now trying to exploit this vacuum The USA and Germany have banned the export of medical protective equipment there is a de facto travel ban between the USA and Europe Is the transatlantic relationship now finally ruined The fact that a politician first thinks of his own people for a second is not defamatory Politicians are first and foremost elected by their nation and for their nation But the second after that you have to decide How narrowly do you define your national interest At present unfortunately national interest is again defined very narrowly according to the motto My country first or even My country alone It is wrong to give the neighbour the cold shoulder out of humanitarian but also national interest In today is world the interests of one is own nation can no longer be defended if at the same time one tries to ignore all the others We are far too interconnected For better or for worse Covid19 is just showing us that Why Nations cannot exist in this world alone We are so politically economically culturally ecologically so closely linked And we have all benefited enormously from this A country like Germany owes its prosperity to globalization We import raw materials from all over the world produce all over the world have hightech production in Germany but are dependent on suppliers from abroad Anyone who wants to turn all this back will drive Germany and Europe into impoverishment After all we are building more than we need ourselves and earn a lot of our money from exports But not only that globalization has also lifted billions of people out of poverty That is the one good thing The problem is that everything that happens next door ends up with us tomorrow So there is only one solution more not less international cooperation Germany has also temporarily refused to help Italy I was very shocked by Germany is initial dealings with Italy When people were already dying in Bergamo and we stopped an export of aid to Italy I thought The Italians will not forget this in the next hundred years Thank God the export ban was soon lifted but the miserable debate followed as to whether we in Europe should help ourselves financially That too has now been resolved to some extent but it leaves drag marks I am concerned about the relationship among Europeans Is the EU Commission playing the role it should be playing Not yet In such a crisis the nation states are the first to act anyway The problem was that the heads of state and government were initially divided But there always seems to be an invisible cement in Europe when things get very very difficult That was also the case this time In the end we Europeans do pull ourselves together Angela Merkel has contributed to this Germany plays a major role in Europe we earn most from Europe but we are also the largest economy with the most people And we are at the heart of Europe That is why it often depends on us Of course we too have interests and are rather conservative in terms of financial policy but we keep the shop together That is Germany is task we always carry on more than one shoulder and we have to push Europe is compromises forward We are the greatest political and economic power in Europe and we must accept this responsibility Russia and China are helping European countries including Italy with medical supplies How do you assess the fact that Moscow and Beijing are now exploiting the powerpolitical vacuum left by the USA and the EU This is less true for Russia it now has to cope with pandemic and low oil prices China is trying to establish itself as a leading power in the fight against Corona even if the virus has come from within its own country The Chinese now want to build a medical Silk Road after an economic Silk Road I doubt if that will succeed China is partly responsible for the outbreak of the pandemic because of its reluctant attitude People know that Is the repressive Chinese social model attractive worldwide Probably not But a recent survey showed that 52 percent of Italians name China as the nation most friendly to them When asked about their greatest enemy 45 percent of Italians named Germany This shows that the corona virus acts like an accelerant It is not only merciless in terms of health but also mercilessly shows our weaknesses national European international China is trying to hide the origin of the Corona crisis at home How should the international community react China should let international experts into the country as soon as possible to investigate the spread of the virus In the end the clarification of where the virus really comes from how it spread so quickly and how one could have warned earlier is also in Beijing is interest Because it will not be the last pandemic we experience The WHO and the UN Security Council are the right bodies for this The American President is strategy of putting China in the dock so to speak is as unwise as it is ineffective Whatever mistakes China has made you will not be able to isolate this country of 14 billion people internationally It is during a pandemic that the USA freezes its payments to the World Health Organization Do you share the criticism of a WHO that is too chinafriendly I do not share this criticism The WHO has effectively combated some epidemics but not others Unfortunately the action against Covid19 was not very convincing That is why we must strengthen the WHO now instead of starving it out It is irresponsible to deprive the WHO of its resources in the middle of a pandemic Unfortunately the US President is behaving like the Chinese President he is trying to divert attention from his own responsibility The US secret services warned of Corona at the beginning of the year Trump ignored it Now he is conducting an internal American election campaign with his attacks on the WHO The USA wants to elect its president in November What do you expect It is difficult for the Democrats to campaign at the moment Presidential candidate Joe Biden whom I know well from my days as Vice Chancellor is campaigning from the home office But unlike usual Americans do not rally behind the president in a crisis In the end the outcome of the election will again depend on the outcome in some swing states Sigmar Gabriel head of

extremely concerned about the threat that the new coronavirus presents to the overcrowded Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos DW spoke with MSF is Florian Westphal Greek officials are shutting camps for displaced people nationwide to visitors for two weeks in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus Florian Westphal is the chairman of the German branch of Doctors Without Borders He spoke with DW about fears that the coronavirus might spread in the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos How big is your fear that the coronavirus could wreak even more havoc in the Moria camp Florian Westphal We are extremely concerned about the threat the coronavirus presents to the more than 20000 people living in the Moria camp at the moment This is a camp that was designed for 3000 people So it is more than six times over capacity and many people are living very cramped together Some five to sixperson families are living on 3 square meters 32 square feet That is a catastrophic situation regarding water and sanitation Unfortunately this is an ideal breeding ground for a rapid spread of the virus What is your biggest fear Our biggest fear is that the people are simply not in the position to take the precautions they need to take In some areas of the camp there is one water station for up to 1300 people The conditions are very cramped There is no soap it is impossible for the people to take the most basic hygienic precautions And that is what is worrying because that means they cannot do anything to stop the spread of the virus if it were to arrive in the camp What do you hear from your staff on the ground Are there any precautions yet Our colleagues on the ground report that there is apparently discussion around a sort of an emergency rescue plan or a crisis response plan but we do not know what that would look like yet Generally at Moria medical care is totally insufficient There are not enough medics in the camp We have no idea for the time being how that could be resolved From your perspective does the Greek government have proper emergency planning for the Moria camp yet We have heard that they do And we have certainly started talking with them about that But the latest information I have does not really indicate that there have been very concrete plans as to what they would do if say in the next couple of hours we have a confirmed case That is just something we have to assume and live with as a risk Do you think the coronavirus might already have arrived and just not been tested for yet That is always a possibility We know that one local Greek woman has tested positive In this crisis because of this threat there is only one solution I think The European Union must now do everything possible to evacuate these people as quickly as possible The Moria camp on Lesbos is not a place where you can handle a potential corona threat and the action needs to come now What advice is your staff passing on to the residents of the Moria camp It is difficult We all know the advice about how we should protect ourselves against the spread of the virus But how can you do that there We tell people keep a safe distance wash your hands frequently use disinfectant but these things are not available in the Moria camp That is why people need to be evacuated That is the only solution and the only way to handle the risk In Germany we hear that elderly people and those with chronic respiratory infections are the most vulnerable Who is most vulnerable in the camp Many people there are very vulnerable anyway There are very sick children there who are suffering from chronic diseases such as epilepsy or diabetes Others have severe mental health issues and we have adults too who have been traumatized through violence in their countries of origin or while fleeing to Greece So it is difficult to predict But in principle all these people are extremely vulnerable to yet another health threat You run a hospital outside the Moria camp What is your biggest challenge The biggest challenge right now is the one that it is always been which is that we are dealing with a crisis especially a mental health crisis that we have rarely seen before anywhere in the world Children are committing selfharm young children are talking about suicide They stop eating stop speaking We can treat them for the moment at the hospital but then they always have to go back to where they came from and that makes them sick That problem was there before the corona threat but this threat on top of it is making our work even more difficult There is a shortage of water in the camp So how can people wash their hands and adhere to basic hygiene The lack of water in the Moria camp is really dramatic You have to remember it is located in the wild in an olive grove In some parts of the camp people have built shelters from plastic sheeting Up to 1300 people are using a single source of water Sanitation is a huge problem Up to 160 people on average are having to use one toilet That is unhygienic Protecting yourself against the corona virus is almost impossible in these conditions Read more DW examines new migration tension between EU Turkey What would you say to people who wonder why their countries should provide refuge to people currently on Lesbos if the island has become a breeding ground for the virus The people of Lesbos are just as entitled to our care health care and our help as anyone is in Germany anyone walking down a Berlin street These people are in extreme need They are human beings For a continent that keeps claiming that it is so committed to humanitarian values the simple fact that for years now at Moria the EU has been basically walking all over these humanitarian values that is not an excuse for inaction The obligation to act is the same as it would be for everyone else who is threatened by this virus What does the EU need to do Our main demand to the European Union is very

that house many thousands of asylumseekers this week the Turkish ambassador to the US told reporters that trying to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus to displaced camps in Syria would be a mission impossible Analysts warned some of the language around refugees and the global pandemic may be political rhetoric that risks stigmatizing people fleeing war who are at risk The danger that people will instrumentalize this topic is there said Rene Wildangel a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations The debate on allowing additional refugees into Europe is already very divisive and polemic If you have additional arguments asserting that it is dangerous at the moment to do this it could probably help shift the discourse in a negative way But as the refugee issue once again becomes a political football the fragile circumstances of the roughly 12 million people who have fled the Syrian conflict across Turkey and the Middle East have raised concerns about how well prepared refugee camps in the region are to face the virus Some people fleeing the violence found that refugee camps were too full or unsafe leaving them to camp by roads Syria No water in some camps There are no known cases in camps in Syria according to the World Health Organization WHO but the country is fragile health systems may not have the capacity to detect and respond to an epidemic spokesman Hedinn Halldorssan said All of Syria has a fragmented health system basically a health system on its knees so it goes without saying there are huge challenges Halldorssan said There are 62 million internally displaced people across Syria Now with the recent bombardment of the northern Idlib province 3 million people have been squeezed into a region formerly of 500000 If there was an outbreak now the situation would be very bad said Orwa Khalifeh an advocacy officer at the Syrian American Medical Society which operates in Idlib and is preparing a plan to combat the virus While Halldorsson said personnel are being trained and laboratories in Idlib and Ankara are being stocked with diagnostic kits Khalifeh said the lack of intensive care units in the region was a big problem and the Idlib health directorate had no hospitals that could isolate patients Other NGOs in the region are trying to spread awareness on safe hygiene practices such as washing hands but in some camps there is no water so it is a problem Khalifeh said ulliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Families flee as frontline closes in Syrian troops have intensified their push for the country is last major rebel enclave a prelude to their total defeat according to President Bashar Assad The violence and mass displacement could result in the biggest humanitarian horror story of the 21st century said the UN is humanitarian and emergency relief head Mark Lowcock Children in particular have become the face of this suffering liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Largest exodus since World War II Of the almost 900000 forced from their homes and shelters in the last three months 80 have been women and children a UN spokesperson said Around 300000 of those have fled since the start of February alone The wave of displacement is the largest exodus of civilians since World War II liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Deadly temperatures With temperatures reaching minus seven Celsius 19 degrees Fahrenheit at the snow covered displacement camps in the hills near Turkey is borders seven children have died from exposure and bad living conditions Save the Children said families are burning whatever they can find to stay warm The chairty warned the death toll could rise liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Belligerents bolster forces Convoys of Turkish commandos rolled toward the former deescalation zone as Russianbacked Syrian forces intensified their push to retake the area in late January After 13 Turkish soldiers stationed there to support rebels were killed in early February diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire stalled liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Highway to nowhere Assad is offensive to retake the strategic M5 highway leading through Idlib province to Syria is second city Aleppo has been a longterm objective After a Russian bombing campaign helped Syrian forces capture all towns along the route on February 11 fierce fighting in western Aleppo forced more than 43000 toward the Turkish border liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Russian bombing indiscriminate The sheer number of Russian and Syrian aerial and artillery attacks on displacement camps hospitals and schools suggest they cannot all be accidental UN human rights spokesperson Rupert Colville said His office has recorded 299 civilian deaths this year 93 caused by the Syrian government and its allies Michelle Bachelet the UN is human rights chief called the campaign indiscriminate liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Rebels jihadis strike back Turkishsupported rebels have been caught out by the onslaught as have jihadis who are not officially backed by Ankara One Islamist group Hayat Tahrir alSham scored a rare victory last week when they downed a particular model of helicopter that Syrian forces are thought to use to drop barrel bombs on civilians liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point Search for safety The UN is Bachelet said no shelter is now safe and displacement camps have been overwhelmed by the number of those fleeing from the violence Many have left the camps to take their chances on the road Bachelet called for humanitarian corridors to be established to allow civilians to escape liliSyria Idlib reaches a breaking point No way out Turkey has closed its borders to prevent a further influx of Syrians It already hosts 35 million refugees That leaves the people of Idlib with no escape route More than 500000 of those fleeing are children Author Tom Allinson liul Jordan Close monitoring lowers risks In the more stable situation in Jordan no COVID19 cases have been detected and there are no risks in the camps because the preventative measures inside the camps are the same as those outside said Mohammad Hawari a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency UNHCR in Jordan Education programs have been rolled out and health conditions are good Hawari said although close conditions in camps could cause infections to spread faster Hospitals inside the camps are prepared to respond to any situation Previously we experienced similar crises such as SARS the response steps are similar Hawari said Wildangel who had recently been to the main Zaatari camp said the risk is lower there because they very tightly monitor who is going in and out and it is very easy for their health services while the conditions are not ideal to assess the risks Camps in Jordan are run in line with the UNHCR is policy advocating they be integrated into government plans for disease outbreaks That policy suggests camps across the region can only be as safe or exposed as their host countries Jordan is Zaatari camp houses around 80000 people Lebanon a big task Lebanon has recorded 41 COVID19 cases countrywide and since its government decided not establish any formal refugee camps at the start of the Syrian war many of the 15 million Syrian refugees there more than any other country per capita in the world are harder for health services to reach The hundreds of thousands of refugees who live in the big cities under the most pathetic conditions in Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley are often not registered They do not have any access to any health services so probably there the risk is even greater Wildangel said Lisa Abu Khaled the UNHCR spokesperson for Lebanon said they were working with the government and other UN agencies to develop contingency plans in the event of a further spread and were raising awareness among refugees about hygiene and preventative precautions Read more Syrian refugees risk journey home amid dire situation in Lebanon Europe too late to blame coronavirus on refugees Aid groups on the Greek island of Lesbos where many asylumseekers land in the European Union said they were suspending work after rightwing groups attacked staff last week Read more Greece Farright activists in violent clashes to defend Europe against migrants Since a Lesbos resident who had reportedly traveled to Israel and Egypt tested positive for the virus on Monday fears of an outbreak among refugees and migrants there could prompt a more harmful conversation in EU countries The farright German party AfD or other movements are already portraying refugees coming as the harbinger of all evil and diseases and what have you So if they can try to infuse some additional fear Im sure they would be happy to do that if we had such an outbreak Wildangel said It is a little too late to blame the coronavirus on the refugees even for the right wing he added There are other factors that are more important like the situation in Idlib and how the EU deals with Turkey and Putin That all impacts the discussion more than the virus I see that more on the outskirts of the debate DW sends out a selection of the day

the coronavirus outbreak until 2022 a group from the Harvard School of Public Health has claimed Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available the Harvard researchers said in findings published in the journal Science Widespread viral testing would be required in order to allow authorities to know when it might be necessary to retrigger distancing Meanwhile the authors said too much social distancing without respite could be a bad thing Under one scenario that was modeled the social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity is built the paper said highlighting the need for an intermittent approach A major drawback in their model say the authors is how little is currently known about how strong a previously infected person is immunity is and how long it lasts The overall death toll in the US from the virus stands at 26059 according to the

camps There improvised shelters often covered with plastic tarps are perched between fields and bushes That is also the case in Bar Elias where the neverending civil war in neighboring Syria is not as distant as elsewhere Bar Elias is just 15 km 93 mi from the Syrian border Bar Elias is also the home of the Medyen refugee camp Named after its founder Medyen alAhmed the unofficial camp has been operating in Bar Elias since 2013 Currently nine families occupy eight tents in the camp They all come from AlQusayr a western Syrian city belonging to the Homs Governorate The families all live in shelters built right on the ground That means they live in a muddy swamp that is impossible to heat in the winter and one that is unbearably hard and hot in the summer Nine of us live in this tent

Middle East I want my life back In 2013 Medyen alAhmed founded the small camp for his and other families in Bar Elias Lebanon just 15 kilometers from the Syrian border Extra lockdown measures for Syrians Speaking by telephone Medyen says of course he and the others have obeyed all of the curfew and lockdown rules put in place by the Lebanese government in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus but he says it is impossible to observe social distancing in a tent Syrians are used to having limited mobility in Lebanon where refugees were often subjected to arbitrary curfews long before the coronavirus pandemic hit But when the coronavirus pandemic began in midMarch the Lebanese government announced further limits in which only one person would be allowed to conduct all of a given camp is shopping In Bar Elias the job fell to Medyen Maybe that is why he sounds so exhausted on the phone Life was not easy before he says but now I have lost my jobs too and everything is four times as expensive The normally relaxed 43yearold sounds unusually distraught No more school no more work Medyen was a merchant in Syria but then the war came and took everything When he first arrived in Lebanon he was only concerned with one thing The wellbeing of the children He soon began participating in workshops put on by organizations aiding Syrian refugees and then he began working for those same organizations Eventually with financial assistance from a small German organization called Shams sun Medyen started a school in the camp Originally based in a tent the school has now moved into a real twostorey building outside the camp and the state of Lebanon has even said it will recognize diplomas earned there We have had to stop teaching because of the coronavirus says Medyen He says that has been disastrous for the children many of whom can barely read or write as a result of war and displacement In any case many of the contracts that Medyen alAhmed has with aid organizations have been suspended indefinitely We are getting training via WhatsApp and Zoom he tells me but says he does not have a paying job at the moment Read more Devastated by war Syria is Idlib braces for coronavirus Lebanon is disastrous economy Lebanon is already catastrophic economic situation has only been made worse by nationwide coronavirus lockdowns The country is broke and its currency the Lebanese pound has been in free fall for months Most Syrians in Lebanon work as day laborers in the construction agricultural or janitorial sectors where most work has been put on hold as a result of the pandemic Beyond the coronavirus the situation for foreign workers in Lebanon including Syrian and Palestinian refugees was made even more difficult last summer when the government passed a new law requiring laborers to provide documentation of job guarantees from employers before they could legally work Already hard to get before such pledges have become impossible to obtain during the coronavirus pandemic Syrians being stigmatized Basmeh Zeitooneh is a nongovernmental organization NGO working on a number of refugee projects in the Beqaa Valley Representatives from the group say they are familiar with the problems Syrians face here Mohamed Taleb who runs the organization is community center says Many Syrians are suffering from stigmatization because most Lebanese simply assume Syrians are more likely to have the coronavirus because of a presumed lack of hygiene and the cramped living quarters of the camps The Lebanese government has actively contributed to that stigmatization This past Monday for instance Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the crisis had three faces in Lebanon Beyond the coronavirus itself Aoun pointed to the country is overall economic crisis and the presence of Syrian refugees as reasons contributing to the sorry state of affairs in Lebanon Tellingly Aoun did not say a word about corruption rampant in Lebanon for decades during his address For many Syrian children the situation is especially difficult they cannot go to school and have no real options to dream of No infections in Syrian camps so far To date there have been no coronavirus infections registered in any of Lebanon is Syrian refugee camps a fact that Medyen alAhmed and Mohamed Taleb confirmed Still one case of infection was recently registered at a Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Baalbek According to Johns Hopkins University in the US a total of 750 coronavirus infections have been registered in Lebanon and 25 people have died of its resulting disease COVID19 It must be said however that no one has any idea what the actual number of infected in Lebanon is at this point Of course it would be disastrous if cases began to appear in the Syrian refugee camps because everyone in them is connected and they are living in such close proximity to one another says Mohamed Taleb Read more Coronavirus in Syria An invisible enemy Worried about medical care But what would happen if someone in a camp were to recognize COVID19 symptoms Some organizations such as Doctors Without Borders have set up health centers for Syrians at Lebanese hospitals But Mohamed Taleb says most Syrians are too scared to go to such centers because they fear they could run into legal trouble if they no longer have valid residency permits or other valuable documents Last year the Lebanese government forcibly deported several hundred Syrians for lacking such documents Therefore people think long and hard before seeking a coronavirus test or treatment for they know there are only two alternatives health care or possible deportation The international NGO Human Rights Watch has raised issues with Lebanon is policies and called on the government to make clear to Syrians in the country that they need not fear legal retribution and will receive medical treatment if they have COVID19 symptoms Mohamed Taleb is 24 and works for the humanitarian organization Basmeh Zeitooneh Coronavirus information via WhatsApp Basmeh Zeitooneh and other organizations have been handing out hygiene kits in and around Bar Elias as well as informing people about the virus via WhatsApp They have also devoted a lot of energy to informing refugees how to deal with coronavirus conspiracy theories and related disinformation We received soap disinfectant and masks too says Medyen alAhmad He says he and his wife have taught their children how to protect themselves and that others in the camp are well aware of ways to minimize the risk of infection I am most worried about the health of the children Medyen is wife Umn Khaled says on the telephone She is a humble and friendly woman who tells me We will just have to trust in God beyond that The interior of Medyen alAhmed and his family is tent seen in 2018 Fearful of starvation Medyen says most of the larger camps in Lebanon receive financial assistance but the smaller ones often fall through the cracks He sounds concerned then he says I do not know how life will change after the coronavirus Meanwhile Lebanon has loosened some of its restrictions For instance curfews are only in place from 9 pm until 5 am and cafes and restaurants can now open though they can only seat onethird of their capacity at any given time Medyen says a certain level of normalcy has also returned to the camps but he adds People cannot put up with this situation much longer They have no money and they are finding it difficult to just do nothing all day Meanwhile they are more scared of starvation than they are of the

handling the corona virus He criticises the EU less harshly than before out of calculation Daniel Verdú Rome Matteo Salvini is office in Rome next to the church of San Luigi dei Francesi is a small sanctuary in the attic full of souvenirs and gifts from his followers A collection of rosaries hangs from a beam and on the shelves are Virgin Mary is as well as AC Milan jerseys jackets and police badges Some unopened boxes are still on the floor It is now six months since he had to move to his new office After a failed attempt to overthrow the government he lost his post as Deputy Prime Minister and above all as Minister of the Interior when he had thrown Europe into turmoil But the 46yearold is a chameleon has already transformed himself into another Salvini and has now dimmed his rhetoric by several notches Salvini is Lega party is up to 32 percent of the vote in polls and if it wants to continue to grow it must win over those voters who once voted for Silvio Berlusconi That is why Salvini is no longer so focused on immigration but on the economy In May elections will be held in six regions of Italy which has been extremely badly affected by the Corona epidemic WORLD Since the beginning of the Corona crisis you have repeatedly attacked the government and accused it of bad management Why Matteo Salvini Now it is a matter of dealing with this health emergency finding new beds for intensive care and supporting companies that are in difficulty When this phase ends what has been done in the weeks before should be reviewed And it is obvious that the first warnings which came as early as January were ignored by the government which did not feel it necessary to intervene with controls and blockades So the current extent of the infection could have been avoided In addition the financial aid is zero The 36 billion euros is nothing Companies estimate that EUR 50 billion will be needed to revive the economy Each point of the gross domestic product corresponds to EUR 18 billion And estimates suggest a two per cent fall which means we need at least 36 billion euros The main points of infection and spread of the virus in Europe are two regions governed by the Lega Lombardy and Veneto Has everything been done right there Secured health care is a national responsibility and mayors and governors do what they can The final word on ordinances and school closures is with the central administration The governors of the Lega sounded the alarm on 3 February whereupon the government told us not to exaggerate If it had been set in motion earlier there would have been fewer problems now The public prosecutor is office is also checking the negligence of some hospitals in Lombardy in terms of limiting the risk of infection This is surreal and a shame Instead of honouring the doctors and nurses who have been fighting there for ten days they are being investigated In the face of a crisis would it not be more important to have unity a strong government and a Salvini who is willing to cooperate I would also prefer a strong government but it does not exist We are showering the ministers with proposals We are the first party in the country and therefore we have a duty to do so But it is no use insults from the other side Some countries no longer accept Italians or stop them at the border for fear of contagion Does that worry you If it is an unwarranted alarm it must be reported and stopped It must be said of course that every country is entitled to control its borders and to safeguard the health of its citizens It is strange however that until ten days ago Italy had to accept all sorts of people and now some African countries are banning Italian citizens from entering or worse still from importing Italian goods What do you mean by that Some have started a trade war against Italy using the virus as an excuse Trade goods are completely unproblematic with regard to Corona as are agricultural products If someone refuses to import them then he is concerned about economic interests Would you be worried if there were xenophobic attacks against Italians No the psychosis will pass again besides unfortunately I see that in other European countries there are also the first infected people So it would be against the whole EU Their French ally Marine le Pen has just demanded a suspension of the Schengen Agreement and border controls to Italy We are also calling for Schengen to be suspended but it is too late for that now A few years ago you said in essence that the sooner the euro disappears the better Do you still see it that way Economics is a very precise science And in these three years the euro has not helped either the Italian economy or balanced development in the EU as the founding fathers actually expected Yet it is precisely this currency that I have in my pocket today We in Europe are working with 28 MEPs to change this from within You make a much more moderate and constructive impression on this issue Has governance changed you in this respect Several agreements need to be changed in the EU including the Dublin agreement on the common migration policy This must be done from within However I think it will be difficult I have heard many proposals in a year but very little has happened The current crisis is a test If the EU reforms its rules and makes them more flexible then it would make sense to stick with it But if there is always a no you cannot die of European bureaucracy At the moment Europe seems to agree with you given the situation on the border between Turkey and Greece Here we must make it clear that Turkey does not meet European standards and we must defend European borders We cannot just leave this to the Greek police These police abuse immigrant families It must not come to that but if you leave a country alone you create space for excesses These pictures are proof that something is wrong in Brussels Some would now say that you showed less pity for the boats full of immigrants who came to Italy Women and children could always go ashore And what is more the current Italian government has finally prevented humanitarian corridors through which people from Africa could have come who were actually fleeing from wars I have fought against the illegal smuggling of people There is no evidence so far that more migrants are attracted when the private rescue vessels you fought against are working in the Mediterranean Defending borders is the duty of a minister The Italian Constitution speaks of defending the fatherland that is its borders Statistics show that last year the number of migrants landed rose from 240 to 2700 And the NGOs have resumed their work But my fight is not aimed directly at the NGOs you simply cannot put immigration in private hands More people have arrived but the number of deaths has decreased The fewer deaths the better for everyone When I was in the ministry there were also fewer deaths compared to before But I repeat once again that in many Italian cities immigration has caused problems in living together social problems and racism Italy is a country that is ageing very rapidly In fact it would need more immigrants for this to be regulated What we need is a family policy that allows young Italians to buy a house and have children And not to throw people out of their homes in other countries and then bring them into our factories You have stated that you want to build a strong group in Europe Your friend Viktor Orbá could leave the PPEDE Group and tip the scales How would you react I value him as a politician as Prime Minister patriots and as a human being I would like to see a great political force emerge as an alternative to the Socialists and the People is Parties One that represents a Europe of fatherlands and peoples We are working on it and we hope to contribute to this revolution A fusion of the two groups A fusion of all the alternatives to the Socialists and Christian Democrats Today we are made up of two or three groups Together we would be a much more significant force Matteo Salvini head of the Lega currently the strongest party in Italy In cooperation with El Pais Translated from the Spanish by Bettina SchneiderNote This article has been translated automatically

would cease fire during the rest of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan The General Command announces a pause in all military operations from its side and any breach by the terrorist militias will be met with immediate and harsh response Ahmed alMosmari who represents the forces of military commander Khalifa Hifter said The move was in response to international appeals for a humanitarian truce during Ramadan and according to news agency AP so authorities could focus on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic Libya has been torn between two rival administrations the UNbacked Government of National Accord GNA based in Tripoli and a parallel administration based in the eastern city of Benghazi which is aligned with forces loyal to General Khalifa Hifter Escalating violence The most recent round of fighting began in April last year when Hifter is forces launched an offensive trying to take Tripoli clashing with an array of militias loosely allied with the GNA Violence has escalated in recent weeks with the warring sides accusing each other of shelling civilian neighborhoods In recent days the GNA declared its forces had made gains by recapturing two strategic cities west of Tripoli from Hifter is forces Reuters reported that the proGNA forces were supported by Turkish military drones that targeted eastern supply lines The truce announcement comes amid political uncertainty in the eastern camp after Hifter said on Monday that he would no longer recognize a UNbrokered 2015 powersharing deal Hifter said the agreement has destroyed the country and is now a thing of the past The acting UN envoy in Libya Stephanie Williams on Tuesday called for a humanitarian truce during Ramadan which could pave the way for a permanent ceasefire Libya has been embroiled in conflict and lawlessness since the NATObacked overthrow of longtime dictator Moammar Ghadafi in 2011 Despite pledges made at a highprofile peace summit in Berlin earlier this year the chaos has worsened in recent weeks The clashes have also complicated Libya is efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic So far the country has reported 61 cases and two deaths The World Health Organization said

authority Ischgl instead of Ibiza and a Saint Sebastian fighting the virus while Austria comes out of the lockdown the hour of the dominant is upon us David Schalko It is well known that in Austria malice has long been declared a tourist attraction It is all the more regrettable that no tourists are allowed to enter the country at the moment They would have their true joy Not only are the emergency numbers in this country being misused more and more frequently as denunciation hotlines but the police are also feeling an increasing desire to harass the population One hears of draconian punishments for example if one stops briefly on a park bench and thus fails to maintain a safe distance from passersby 1500 euros or of young people who meet in pairs and are each charged 1800 euros One reads about helicopter flights that check whether people are walking in small groups illegally There is talk of drinking water that is demonstratively not turned on to second home owners until after Easter so that they do not go outside The ÖP has advertised Team Austria in the name of the government in turquoise party colours Just as if it were all congruent As if one was a natural part of this campaign Yes even the coalition partner The Greens let themselves be infected by it People spoke of the brand Austria What they meant was the outstanding discipline and solidarity of the locals Malicious tongues claim that what was actually meant was obedience to authority and block warden mentality If you wanted to philosophize about the Austrian brand then maybe you should talk about Ibiza and Ischgl Perhaps it is no coincidence that they seem like the names of hurricanes that could be continued in alphabetical order Both represent the Austrian tsunami of smallminded greed One has brought down the FPÖ the other leads to panic shrugging in Tyrol The wirepullers of Ibiza should definitely be remembered We do not want to think about what would have happened if the current Minister of the Interior was called Herbert Kickl The FPÖardliner became conspicuous in his short term in office not only by his contemplation of the abolition of the Geneva Conventions and his labelling of asylum centres as centres of exit but also by his belief that the right to follow politics and not the other way round was his right He stood up for a police state which under the circumstances would have been a horror of democratic politics You can literally see the antivirus Gestapo in your mind is eye Bizarrely enough and I almost lost my morning coffee it is precisely this Herbert Kickl who is today acting as a defender of civil rights Let anyone else say that the Austrian has no sense of humour Whereby this one belongs to the brand Austria The other day a doctor said to me after I asked him whether I should put on the protective mask if eana falls This form of sarcasm gives hope in a similar way to the young woman who cried out on my doorstep I cannot stand it any more The lockdown was only in effect for four hours Or when the first bank robbery with a protective mask was committed in Vienna And it also seems grotesque that the very Chancellor who vehemently enforced the ban on disguising Muslims is now sitting at press conferences with an iron gaze on his face Sebastian Kurz is completely in his element these days Confidence and optimism are avoided by him with icy gestures He is resolute and strong No one mimes the apocalyptic as credibly as he does Almost lustful sound with him are terms that one otherwise only knows from the SM area relaxation necessity discipline freedom of movement curfew coercive measures ban It is the hour of the dominant And those who get excited about it when they are allowed to proclaim in darkness it is not happening In between the Health Minister of the Greens Rudolf Anschober who assures us daily in a reassuring audio book style how wellbehaved we are Nevertheless he does his best not to ideologise the crisis At the moment we have to be grateful that the Greens are in government Interestingly enough criticism of the perhaps excessive measures is hardly penetrating That would be considered blasphemous in this country In view of the seriousness of the situation St Sebastian enjoys a perceived 120 percent approval And because the saint himself considers the messianic role most appropriate he announced the resurrection after Easter already at the beginning of the crisis He is a great storyteller Even if one could quietly add here that the resurrection was followed by the journey to heaven The monothematic corona overshadows everything And a skilful politician like Sebastian Kurz knows how to use the bad times to his advantage Confronted with the refugee problem he answers that he should not be approached again for this until a few months As far as Italy is concerned he says that he has no head for it now In the same breath he talks about Italian conditions as if a crime had been committed there And the only grumpy response to the restriction of civil rights is that it is not possible to get away with legal quibbles now Anyone who does not agree to a tracking obligation well then he or she will not know how to solve the problem as if there were no alternative to Chinese conditions in order to stay in the same style Anyone who criticizes all this is virtually on the side of the virus that St Sebastian fights alone every day while wading in the mud It is also the hour of the nationalists who abuse the virus as a metaphor of globalization Despots of the world take advantage of the forced haste We should use this given time to think about certain things because they would point the way for our democratic future It is not enough to say that this has never happened before in order to make unprecedented restrictions on civil rights acceptable We cannot and will not live in a permanent state of emergency The danger that politics will maintain such a state for as long as possible as in the socalled war on terror is more than given If you look at the ongoing corona discourse you can essentially identify three segments that are often perceived as incompatible Human life economy and fundamental rights We must be careful not to play them off against each other It is in principle good and right that every human life should be sacred to us That is so to speak the essence of a free humanitarian society It is in this consensus that its true cohesion lies And the basis of all fundamental rights That is why it was also important in an act of solidarity to downgrade everything else in favour of the protection of vulnerable people There is no doubt about that And it should also be clear to everyone by now that the coronavirus is not a flu epidemic What is less clear is what will stick in everyday life When will it be normal again to kiss someone as a greeting When will we no longer perceive a passerby as a potential threat The main problem is apparently that we cannot assess the virus This leads to a number fetishism where the view of the daily death figures already has the character of body counts We can see from the crisis how difficult it is for us to deal with something that cannot be packaged into clear statistical truths We do not know how many people fall ill asymptomatically We speak of infestation factors and herd immunity at the same time we as a society are affected by a much more serious virus Namely fear In recent years several crises have shown that it spreads virally the fastest And we fall into a kind of panicky paralysis every time we leave the comfort zone At the same time however the viral the spread has long since become the main feature of our global society We have internalized this system Our entire communication system works like a virus Many issues are being raised around the world and if you get infected by them they are accepted emphatically Whether they are truths or fake news Perhaps we should now understand enlightenment as a kind of immunisation Our global societies have been infected by viruses such as rightwing extremism and Islamophobia But also positive viruses like MeToo or Fridays For Future followed the viral spread me principle In this context it is hardly surprising that one of the most successful computer games of recent years was a vanguard in this respect At Plague Inc the player mimes a virus and has to make sure that it spreads worldwide One does not even want to talk about the nature of computer viruses So socially we have long since internalized the principle of the virus We are familiar with it and yet in medical terms it now seems more threatening than climate change or war even though both claim more lives every year than Covid19 Just like other viruses by the way We must therefore take note of the fact that we apply double standards At the moment a corona death is worth more than a road death a cancer death or a war death on the international fear market Corona affects us all Just as Sartre wrote in 1943 that it makes a difference whether you die or I die Despite exhaustion and resignation after the coronavirus we will not wake up in a world where everything is good The near future requires effort commitment and courage All the more we have to deal with why and how something and how more frightening than anything else is causing us fear and above all how we become more immune to the virus Otherwise we will not be able to stop the advance of autocratic systems It is astonishing that war rhetoric rather than medical terminology is used in the context of fighting a virus Why do we speak of reconstruction and not of recovery Does it have to do with the fact that we unconsciously personify the virus Stylizing it as an enemy Fighting it with military means And then initiate the reconstruction phase This virus virtually simulates war without war Ergo without destroying cities and expropriating the rich Yet it cynically captures the core problem Is this developing into an economic strategy for the future Or just fodder for conspiracy theorists We need to rethink our basic economic understanding It is a made system that can be shaped We should not forget that A lot of things will be in trouble after the coronavirus It is also up to us to decide which direction we take economically This would be a unique opportunity to make a massive change of course especially to promote industries that would benefit us in the event of imminent disasters An economy that is in harmony with where our societies should be heading in the coming decades to address major problems such as climate change migration automation health policy and distributive injustices There is much to be learned from this crisis For example Dignity is not sacrosanct The market is not a law of nature Fundamental rights must be protected Work gives us meaning and structure Isolation is rarely just splendid A hug and a smile without a protective mask are valuable cultural mechanisms of a free society Social warmth and solidarity are not empty words The environment recovers when we burden it less Yes one wanted to applaud the fish in the canals of Venice But above all we now know what it feels like when a society as a whole does not take place And what we lack when we lack people When the Second World War was over the world did not cry out for more security and surveillance Rather a philosophy of freedom and selfdevelopment emerged It was called existentialism When the Hong Kong flu broke out in 1968 there were one million deaths worldwide Today hardly anyone remembers the virus But if we had organised a worldwide shutdown back then the whole movement of 68 would probably never have happened When a group of Nigerians was recently caught in Italy breaking the curfew they said that they were authorised to be on the streets After all they come from a tribe that is in principle immune to all viruses Even the police had to laugh Exactly There you go It is not like you can laugh away every disaster But unfortunately we are surrounded by far more people who scare us than make us laugh So let is be careful what we catch in the near future Speaking of which how is Greta Thunberg actually doing David Schalko born in Lower Austria in 1973 is an author director and television producer Among other things he shot the series M Eine

International aid workers are having a tremendously difficult time doing their jobs due to all the travel bans around the world and other quarantine measures In the face of the coronavirus however they are needed more than ever before The coronavirus is not the only crisis the world is struggling with right now It is not even the worst at least in terms of the direct threat posed to the world is most vulnerable people Besides the virus many people are afraid of dying of hunger or a lack of access to basic necessities These are already serious threats on some continents In many places social distancing simply is not possible and many people live hand to mouth If they do not go to work they do not earn money and they cannot buy food Preventative measures to contain COVID19 are also hampering the work of nongovernmental organizations NGOs which are trying to help those who have fled their homes and people who are starving or ill especially in developing and emerging countries The World Health Organization WHO has complained about supply shortages and the difficulties facing employees who need to travel to African countries The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR and the World Food Program WFP are also looking for ways to get their aid workers and goods to areas where they are needed despite travel restrictions and a lack of available aircraft Many other NGOs are also warning of shortages of medicine and food The spread of the coronavirus will have serious consequences in many countries around the world which are now the focus of humanitarian aid and development cooperation says Thomas Beckmann a spokesperson for Diakonie Katastrophenhilfe a Protestant church charity based in Germany People in refugee camps in informal settlements outside megacities or in countries with insufficient health care are defenseless against the consequences of the virus and are in dire need of support Unless Everyone Is Safe No One Is In addition many international aid workers have been forced to leave the countries to which they were assigned in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak Meanwhile some countries could use more help not less be it to combat fake news or to ensure their populations are supplied with the most basic necessities And that is not to mention the global competition for masks and disinfectants that has unfolded In some places there have been reports of urgently needed protective masks that have already been paid for being intercepted before reaching their final destination It is a very real risk that there will not be enough left for the poorest countries in the world Gayle Smith There is a very real risk that there will not be enough left for the poorest countries in the world says Gayle Smith Smith the president of ONE a global movement campaigning to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030 worked as a development policy adviser to former US President Barack Obama and served as the head of the US Agency for International Development There is no question that this crisis will be very expensive But we must invest not only in our own economy but in all people and countries If there is one thing a global pandemic teaches us it is that none of us are safe unless everyone else on the planet is safe Smith said On the ground NGOs are forced to get creative due to shortages of food and staff restrictions on movement and school closures What follows are accounts from aid organizations in India Zambia Iraq and El Salvador about whether and how they are able to continue their work during the coronavirus crisis The police did not pick anyone up so we rented 25 trucks ourselves and drove the people to their villages Ransingh Parmar works with Mahatma Gandhi Seva Ashram an Indian aid organization that receives financial support from the German NGO Welthungerhilfe Parmar lives in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh a state in central India His office is located off a highway that leads to Mumbai New Delhi is more than 300 kilometers 186 miles away The country has around 13500 known cases of coronavirus So far more than 500 people have died I did not understand what was going on at first The government announced a lockdown at the end of March and suddenly there were thousands of people in the streets Migrant workers who had lost their jobs and thus their source of income from one day to the next wanted to return to their villages on foot I saw men and women walking day and night They had no water or food with them They carried luggage on their heads and small children in their arms We had sent all but four or five of our volunteers home because of the curfew but we rounded them back up to cook food for the people The police did not pick anyone up so we rented 25 trucks ourselves and drove the people to their villages Those who seemed sick were put in quarantine That was the first week How do we protect ourselves and others We have to leave the rations of free food at the entrances to the villages Ransingh Parmar Then we heard that the police had closed the borders to neighboring states There is a river here that divides three states Crocodiles live in the waters But people just waded through to avoid the checkpoints Meanwhile the government has promised to help the poor They are supposed to receive money in their accounts but who is going to transfer the money Bank employees are not showing up for work because they are afraid For us the most important thing now is to ensure that aid reaches the people It is a challenge Our employees have permission to go out but no one else is supposed to leave their house Outsiders are also prohibited from entering the villages The question was How do we protect ourselves and others We have to leave the rations of free food at the entrances to the villages There are no masks available for purchase and the authorities do not have any either We had to think of something We have a project in which we train women to become tailors Fifty of them have made 15000 masks so far We gave 5000 to the authorities the remaining 10000 are for our volunteers And we already have requests for thousands more There are many problems Now is the time to be there for one another Not just us Indians but the whole world Interview conducted by Laura Höflinger We drive through remote places and speak through a megaphone It is better than nothing Malama Mwila 32 has been working for Save the Children in Zambia for two years The international aid organization has been working to provide children in this southern African country with access to education and food since 1983 More than half of the country is 16 million inhabitants are under the age of 18 and live in poverty This is especially true for those living in rural areas As in many African countries a disproportionate amount of people here are vulnerable to the coronavirus due to preexisting conditions and inadequate medical care Mwila lives in the capital Lusaka For work he normally travels to many rural villages and cares for the locals At the moment he is mainly helping to organize preventative measures to contain the virus nationwide So far Zambia has 48 registered coronavirus infections Much of my work normally consists of being in personal contact with people For example I visit schools where we hand out food I talk to the kids a lot This is important so that I know what they need and how they are doing This is not possible at the moment because we want to prevent the virus from spreading Sometimes we drive through more remote places in order to educate the people there about COVID19 and teach them basic preventative measures like washing their hands and keeping a safe distance Many people still do not know what is going on We do not get out of the car and instead speak through a megaphone It is better than nothing but of course it would be better if we could talk to the people directly Especially now when there will be more physical and sexual violence against children in many households Kids do not text us when something happens We only hear about it in personal conversations We are distributing beans and corn to parents But that is also a risk since we cannot guarantee that the food actually reaches the children Malama Mwila One of the first measures taken by the government was to close the schools and universities This is a big problem For one because many people will not be able to attend classes We are trying to compensate for this with new programs but it also poses many challenges of its own Online learning is not an option for most of the children They do not have their own computers and rarely have access to the internet at home This is also a difficult situation for us at the NGO At the moment only 10 of our otherwise 40 employees are allowed to be in the office At home we often have power failures from 7 am until 9 pm when you cannot charge a laptop We are now working with radio and TV stations that have generators and can broadcast educational programming to provide at least some learning for everyone The other part of the problem is that many children are now starving Some 42 million children are no longer going to school where they would otherwise receive a meal every day Most of their families cannot replace this important meal at home They do not have enough food themselves We are currently distributing staple foods like beans and corn which are still piled up in schools storage rooms in rations to parents This is also a risk since we cannot guarantee that the food actually reaches the children It is most likely being eaten by everyone in the household so that there is hardly anything left for them But what are we supposed to do We have no other choice In the long run we will need way more food since hardly anyone can work and everything people need to survive is becoming more and more expensive Im very afraid that we will not have enough resources to reach all the people who desperately need our help Interview conducted by Anne Backhaus At the moment we cannot see many of the patients who need our help the most We are trying to assess their condition over the phone Htet Aung Kyi is a doctor from Myanmar He coordinates the operations of Doctors Without Borders in Mosul Iraq The organization provides surgical aid fights epidemics conducts vaccination campaigns operates nutrition centers for the malnourished and cares for pregnant women and newborns in crisis regions around the world Doctors Without Borders is also active in wartorn Iraq Mosul the former stronghold of the Islamic State was heavily contested and has been left in ruins with legions of traumatized people For the past month Iraq has been on a strict lockdown with a curfew People are only allowed on the streets to get the bare essentials In Mosul we run a surgical center for people with war wounds We treat leg and arm injuries We fight inflammation Normally we see 15 to 20 patients a day Most of them are unable to reach us at the moment though some of them desperately need us We are trying to assess their condition over the phone We ask them if they have a fever for instance or any pain or swelling We have already had to call some in for emergency treatment We also run two clinics for pregnant women and newborns The women are from the region As many as 500 babies are born in our centers every month Gradually our stockpiles of medical material protective suits and masks are dwindling We have reserves that will last another month or a month and a half We are trying to find resupplies but it is gotten more difficult on the international market And it is all made more complicated by Iraq is import regulations We have not reached the peak of the infection wave here yet Doctors Without Borders is now also helping Baghdad hospitals prepare for the crisis We can also provide up to 70 beds in our centers in Mosul The numbers are rising We have to expect the worst Interview conducted by Jan Puhl Several of our teams were in countries like Mexico or Guatemala when the curfew began in El Salvador it was difficult getting them back Celina de Sola the founder of the NGO Glasswing International has been fighting the causes and consequences of poverty and violence in El Salvador and other Latin American countries with education and health projects since 2007 Mentoring programs at schools and job training aim to entice young people away from gang violence Now the NGO is trying to soften the societal impacts of the measures taken by the country to contain the coronavirus El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world Social inequality there is extreme and the pandemic is only exacerbating the problems The country with its population of 7 million is trying to fend off the looming health crisis with drastic measures like a nationwide curfew It has 177 recorded cases so far Five people have died Several of our teams were in countries like Mexico or Guatemala when the curfew began in El Salvador it was difficult getting them back Several team members had to quarantine for 30 days since that was what the government required No one is allowed to leave their home and the schools are closed preventing our volunteers from working with students We try to provide educational services digitally but not everyone has internet Our mentors regularly text or call the students Even if they only ask them via SMS or WhatsApp how they are doing or help them with their homework the students get the feeling they are being supported The situation is new for everyone Levels of stress and anxiety are high Interpersonal connections are extremely important People feel less alone when someone checks in regularly and asks How are you holding up How are you What worries me most right now are the economic consequences and a possible increase in domestic violence People who work in the informal sector and were already poor before are not earning anything now On top of that many people are living together in one house and the coronavirus crisis is only increasing their stress They are really afraid because they do not know how they are going to feed their families We do a lot of trauma work to help people understand and deal with their feelings and to try and provide tools for stress management For example we have a digital guide that shows parents how to keep their children busy all day We may not be able to make house calls or meet in large groups anymore but we are working together with public hospitals where our health care team informs people about the coronavirus and tries to identify COVID19 symptoms We are also procuring protective clothing and providing it to hospital staffs and to our healthcare teams But it is very difficult to find items like masks or protective clothing This is especially true for rural areas but they are mostly sold out in cities too Even the hospitals do not have enough disinfectant And we do not have the resources to get enough ventilators which are very expensive Interview conducted by Sonya Peteranderl This piece is part

Plastic bags cardboard and plastic bottles extend as far as the eye can see A young child maybe six years old wades through the garbage Here in the socalled jungle where makeshift huts crush up against one another and children play in the filth the squalor of the Moria refugee camp is on full display This hot spot located on the Greek island of Lesbos has been the scene of Europe is largest humanitarian crisis for years now A camp originally designed to temporarily shelter 3000 people it is now the cramped home of more than 20000 The situation is not much better on other islands in the Aegean In all some 42000 refugees and migrants are currently stuck on Lesbos Chios and Samos and many have been there for more than a year Now the coronavirus pandemic threatens to make the situation even worse Just recently Germany and a number of EU member states including France and Luxembourg declared their willingness to take in those in most desperate need of help Vulnerable unaccompanied

among a coalition of willing EU member states within a week Read more MSF Moria refugee camp an ideal breeding ground for a rapid spread of coronavirus Water cannon tear gas and smoke bombs But that willingness is not only humanitarian in nature it is also pragmatic The EU was forced into action when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan decided to open his country is borders with Greece two weeks ago sending thousands of refugees rushing toward Europe Greek security forces overwhelmed by the sheer number of refugees demanding entry into Europe answered with water cannon tear gas and smoke bombs It was reported that at least two people were killed by Greek bullets something the government in Athens denies Images of standoffs were quickly broadcast around the world putting the EU under pressure to do something about the situation But the new COVID19 coronavirus pandemic has changed everything with EU member states enhancing border controls or closing borders altogether in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus That was also the reason the United Nations refugee agencyUNHCR and the International Organization for Migration IOM gave for the temporary suspension of activities at their Refugee Resettlement Program Thus for the moment no safe haven can be found for those refugees in especially dire straits that includes safe haven in Germany Read more Opinion In Greece refugees are painted as the enemy Asselborn It is not up to us The program for taking in unaccompanied children was not supposed to be affected by the situation at least according to European Commission spokesperson Adalbert Jahnz He claimed albeit in vague terms that the process would go on as planned but suggested that respecting and navigating the many different steps EU member states had taken to stop the spread of the virus was taking up a lot of time and making it impossible to set out a clear timeline for the transfer of children from Greece Jahnz went on to say However I assure you that intense discussions are going on as we speak and preparations are currently underway Another spokesperson for the Commission which has agreed to play a coordinating role in the project told DW the COVID19 pandemic will likely have an effect on the process Germany is Interior Ministry was vague as well saying only that the European Commission is currently assessing what level of coordination is possible right now in light of the situation On Wednesday a statement was released saying the COVID19 pandemic would not have any effect on our efforts Still speaking with DW on Thursday Luxembourg is Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn conceded that his country would not be taking in refugee children for now It is not up to us to Greece or the UNHCR In terms of security and health it is simply impossible to guarantee humane conditions for taking in people during these difficult times said Asselborn He said Luxembourg and other EU member states would do all they could in the meantime to prepare for the children to be transferred as soon as possible Boris Cheshirkov a spokesperson for UNHCR Greece understands that coronavirus will slow the process but urged the EU to push on with preparations regardless so that they can start transferring children as soon as the time comes Read more Germany stops accepting refugees over coronavirus Refugee camps under quarantine

In Germany celebrities and politicians started online petitions to do just that under the names WirHabenPlatz We Have Space and LeaveNoOneBehind so far 80000 people have signed the appeals Those behind the campaigns point to the miserable living conditions at the camps something DW journalists have frequently documented pointing to the fact that hundreds of refugees at Moria for instance are forced to share just one toilet It is also almost impossible to bathe at the camps and even the most basic hygienic precautions such as washing one is hands cannot be taken They also note that there is a severe shortage of doctors at the camps to help with those who may become infected There is simply no way for the more than 20000 people crammed into the bursting facility to isolate themselves to avoid contracting the virus Hoping to stop an explosion of infections the Greek government has put its camps under quarantine Residents are only allowed to leave the camps during the day and then only in small numbers It remains to be seen if that will be enough though EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johannsson is convinced it is On Thursday she tweeted that she is working to make

coordinated national response ethnic armed groups and the Myanmar military are still engaging in conflict utting the immediate survival of many civilians at risk Under the threat of conflict adhering to social distancing and disease prevention measures are a secondary priority in many ethnic minority states in Myanmar People are faced with inadequate medical care curbs on movement due to both conflict and the pandemic and trouble accessing basic goods and services Despite the government is stated commitment to tackle the COVID19 pandemic the Myanmar military also known as the Tatmadaw has continued its offensives in many of the country is seven minority states particularly Rakhine and Chin states as well as Karen state The Karen ethnic group who constitute roughly 7 of the country is population have for decades faced forced relocation military offensives systematic rape and murder and have seen their villages farms and property burned like many other minority groups in Myanmar Subscribe to Corona Compact DW is newsletter tracking coronavirus in Asia Conflictstricken country The conflicts in Myanmar between ethnic armed groups and the military which have gone on since 1948 constitute what can be considered the world is longest civil war In February over 2000 Karen were forced to flee their homes in northern Karen state amid an offensive launched by the army while other regions of the state are still facing regular attacks initiated by the military In ethnic states including Karen the government and its security forces are drastically increasing the vulnerability to the deadly virus because of military is brutal offensive attack on communities without caring calls of ceasefire from ethnic armed organizations ethnic political parties civil society and the United Nations the Karen Peace Support Network KPSN said in a statement last month Their villages have been burnt down and they have been killed like animals in the forest said Naw Wahkushee a spokesperson for the KPSN There are currently 15 villages that are under threat and people are ready to flee if there is more escalation of the conflict in those areas she said They are more afraid of the Myanmar army than they are of COVID19 In the northern state of Rakhine where the armed group Arakan Army is currently embroiled in an escalating conflict with the Myanmar military the number of displaced persons was 164211 by the end of April according to a statement issued by the Rakhine Ethnic Congress In those areas of guerrilla conflict in northern Shan state and much more seriously the whole of Rakhine and southern Chin concerns about COVID19 are secondary to concerns about surviving said Anthony Davis a security consultant specializing in Myanmar issues Read more Reporting the coronavirus at a Rohingya camp Saving lives is now the most important task On April 29 outgoing UN envoy to Myanmar Yanghee Lee issued a scathing farewell letter calling for an investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Rakhine and Chin states While the world is occupied with the COVID19 pandemic the Myanmar military continues to escalate its assault in Rakhine state targeting the civilian population Yanghee wrote Calls for peace On April 2 18 foreign ambassadors to Myanmar also called for an end to armed conflicts between the military and ethnic armed groups calling for both sides to focus on protecting the most vulnerable communities from the devastating impact of COVID19 Later that month the government announced a joint COVID19 committee with ethnic armed groups to collectively curb the spread of the pandemic and members of the committee are expected to share information on their respective measures However according to Davis the pandemic is unlikely to change the state of conflict in each region In some areas it may put it conflict on hold and Im thinking particularly of conflicts between the Tatmadaw and the Shan and the KNU But elsewhere most notably Rakhine it is making no difference whatsoever It is not for the last months and it will not for the next months the war is continuing he said Where does the funding go While millions of dollars in international aid has been sent to the central government of Myanmar ethnic groups who typically maintain their own healthcare and education infrastructure fear that a centralized response against COVID19 will not be enough On April 20 the World Bank approved a 50 million 46 million credit line for Myanmar is COVID19 response The Myanmar government has also allocated a budget of 24 billion Myanmar Kyats 17 million 1575 million for taking preventive measures in camps for internally displaced persons throughout the country and millions more have been sent by private donors NGOs and international aid organizations But much of the cash is meant to be used to boost the country is minimal intensive care capacity mostly in Yangon Myanmar is most populous city and the epicenter of the country is outbreak This kind of healthcare is mostly inaccessible to people outside of urban centers Critics also question whether donations to the central government will reach health networks operated by ethnic groups themselves It is like they are trying to destroy the existing federal structure if they are only supporting the central government They are making all of the ethnic groups access funding through the government said Naw Wahkushee Read more Press freedom in Myanmar Media under pressure in the corona crisis Naw Wahkushee added that for the Karen National Union KNU its own healthcare system is more effective as people can access services and material in their own language and region Additionally most groups are involved in educating people and implementing their own measures to curb the spread of COVID19 Those measures in Karen state include screening the temperature of people crossing district lines and setting up their own isolation centers A big concern Even while Myanmar uses the aid to develop its central health system most of the country does not have the infrastructure to manage a pandemic Most people in Myanmar who die of this are going to die at home said Davis The idea of flattening the curve that may be relative in Mandalay and Yangon but in the villages they are going to die at home Critics also say that the aid devoted to internally displaced people is camps is unlikely to reach all of those in need and would not be enough to offset what is lost in blocked humanitarian assistance and supply deliveries which have been hindered due to closed borders Roughly 241000 displaced people are living in such camps throughout the country according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs It is a big concern for us that there will be hunger after they closed the border and because of the economic crisis of the situation It is not as easy to transport supplies as it was before says Naw Wahkushee We are calling for every group to work together to save lives 53360164

my way to Germany says Muhammed who is from Afghanistan and looks much younger than his 18 years He is carrying two small bags with some clothes and snacks Nothing else He wants to cross over into Greece but tells me he has no idea what to expect how arduous the journey will be how many days it will take and whether he will actually make it over the border Read more Refugee crisis in Greece Anger and foreboding grow on Lesbos I bumped into Muhammed on a street in Istanbul is Zeytinburnu neighborhood where many other migrants have gathered Most are from Afghanistan and Pakistan I only came across one Syrian refugee Muhammed still has not decided whether he will actually attempt the journey to Greece He knows Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is using the migrant situation to exert pressure on the EU But when on February 27 Erdogan announced Turkey would no longer prevent people from crossing the border into Europe many migrants in Zeytinburnu sprang into action Taxis buses and cars now line the street with drivers advertising trips to the Turkish city of Edirne about 220 kilometers 140 miles away near the borders with Greece and Bulgaria Muhammed from Afghanistan is one of thousands of migrants who have gathered at the TurkishEU border in recent days Muhammed and his five friends also want to head to Edirne So he haggles with one of the drivers who says he will charge 22 24 per person for the threehour journey a price the group is unwilling to pay I ask about Muhammed is family He tells me they are currently in the town Nigde in central Turkey There he explains they are working for a pittance Muhammed has been doing various odd jobs in Istanbul and is frustrated by the experience He says that either they fire us so they do not have to pay up or they withhold some of the money we were promised Muhammed and his friends eventually agree on a fare 16 each with the driver who promises to drive them straight to the border But he warns that if the authorities catch us I will pretend not to know you Otherwise I will get in trouble Read more Migrants stuck on EU doorstep What is Germany doing Two hellish days at the border The group sets off in a gray VW van I follow behind in my own car After just 50 kilometers Muhammed calls me to say that his driver is feeling nervous because I keep tailing them So he tells me we should meet in Edirne Otherwise he adds he will kick us out of his car and keep our money Along the way I spot dozens of other vehicles filled with migrants including women and children all heading toward Edirne A few kilometers from the Pazarkule border crossing Im stopped by large group of police Brusquely one of them asks me what I want I reply that I am a journalist and hand over my international press card He wants to know whether Im from Turkey or abroad I tell him Im from Turkey and seemingly pleased with my answer he lets me drive on More than 1000 migrants have gathered at the border crossing I do not see any Turkish law enforcement officials anywhere Migrants are sitting on the ground with some burning branches to keep warm There is a fair bit of smoke in the air and the scene is oddly reminiscent of a dystopian movie Some migrants have managed to get past the barbed wire and move into the border strip separating Turkey and Greece But just 100 meters 330 feet on Greek border guards have taken up position Whenever anyone get close to the border they fire tear gas in their direction forcing them to flee back to the Turkish side The air is now thick with smoke and tear gas which along with rain and intense cold defines my time at the border Whenever migrants get close to the border Greek border guards fire tear gas in their direction In my two days there I see babies crying in their mothers laps and people suffering from desperation hopelessness and hunger I meet three men in their late 50s on the night after my arrival Judging by their accents they are from Istanbul Their clothes are relatively clean so they must have arrived recently One of them asks which border crossing will be opened to which I reply that there is no plan to do so They will not tell me where exactly they are from and I get the feeling they are ordinary Turks trying to mix in with the migrants to cross over into the EU The men then ponder crossing the border by boat We want another life In the early morning hours of my second day I get a call from Muhammed He tells me they have bought an inflatable plastic boat for 800 lira 120130 and are now waiting for the right moment to paddle across the Evros River that marks the border to Greece He sends me his location hunkered down by a patch of forest and I make my way over to see him On the opposite side of the river only 50 meters away armed Greek police officers are vigilantly monitoring the situation Read more Will the EUTurkey refugee deal collapse As Muhammed waits he snacks on a Turkish bagel and then lights a cigarette As Im about to take his picture he gets angry What are you doing brother Do not film me If my mother sees this she will be very sad he says adding She does not know I smoke either The teenagers are using their phones to pick the best route across the river Muhammed meanwhile tells the other migrants gathered with them that so far about 100 people have made it to the other side A far larger number however were caught and sent back Eventually I return to Pazarkule border crossing where some 3000 migrants are now camped out There are people from all corners of the world Africans Iranians Pakistanis Palestinians and many Afghans But I meet very few Syrian refugees however Tensions with Greek border guards meanwhile have intensified As ever more migrants make their way to the border Greek officers fire more tear gas into the crowd Right in front of my eyes five people are severely injured one of them is still a child The migrants react angrily with some throwing stones at the border guards Amid the chaotic violent skirmishes a tall young man throws his hands in the air In fluent Turkish English and Persian he yells We have had enough of war Stop throwing stones and sit down We want another life ulliFrom sea rescue to quarantine A visual diary from the Ocean Viking At see with the Ocean Viking I joined the Ocean Viking crew in midFebruary setting sail for two weeks

Southeastern Europe most of whom live in cramped conditions without access to health care and basic sanitation are facing a humanitarian disaster Those who already earn a meager living by collecting junk and plastic or selling food household products and flowers are currently unable to carry out even this informal work Read more Coronavirus Are lessdeveloped EU countries more susceptible Roma rights groups are alarmed The community which suffers racism and discrimination at the best of times is now being treated with even more stigmatization On top of general measures to prevent the spread of COVID19 authorities in Slovakia Romania and Bulgaria have introduced additional restrictions to put Roma communities under quarantine sometimes resorting to the use of police and military force Roma rights groups across Europe are alarmed The Central Council of German Sinti and Roma recently expressed concern that rightwing extremist and nationalist politicians in Central and Southeast

Open Society Roma Initiatives Office in Berlin said it would be catastrophic if the Roma population continued to be neglected The majority society has not yet understood that unemployment among Roma is bad for the whole economy and rightwing extremist attacks against Roma are bad for democracy he told DW Now it has to become clear that poor health conditions for Roma have direct and immediate

Day But the coronavirus pandemic will make that difficult this year Mother is Day is for florists like Easter for the chocolate egg industry No other time of the year sees more flowers sold than on the day the world celebrates its moms But just like Easter Mother is Day will take place during an extraordinary time this year Apart from those who still live with their moms the traditional Sunday visit will have to be shelved for many due to coronavirus restrictions That is why many people across the world are looking at a delivery service for their Mother is Day flowers In Holland Europe is top flower producer online sales have boomed in the past few weeks says Michel van Schie spokesperson of Dutch florist auction company Royal Flora Holland In addition to Mother is Day orders there was also a trend of Dutch employers sending flowers to their employees homes offices as a sign of appreciation in tough times adds van Schie Flower delivery services like Fleurop or Bloom Wild expect extremely high demand for Mother is Day They recommended that customers place online orders early before stocks ran out But while the demand for flowers is high on Mother is Day despite the Covid19 crisis the main hurdle remains the supply logistics experts say The market is there the capacity of production is almost there what is not there at all is the freight capacity explains Isabelle Spindler managing director of flower grower Red Land Roses in Ruiru northeast of Kenya is capital Nairobi Because of the coronavirus passenger flights to and from Kenya have been cancelled Cargo flights still operate but there is not enough freight space on the available planes while costs have increased substantially according to Spindler We can only service 40 per cent of the demand explains Clement Tulezi head of the Kenya Flower Council which represents 135 of the East African nation is roughly 170 flower producers Flower traders and importers have tried to come up with inventive ways to fill the gap for example by piggybacking on humanitarian aid flights that return from Africa largely empty Some importers were even considering chartering flights according to Brueck For Mother is Day every effort is made to solve logistical problems she says There is no doubt Everyone in the flower industry wants to make the most of Mother is Day For many there is also the hope of recuperating recent losses Just a few weeks ago a lot of flowers never made it to a customer who could enjoy them Tulips in prime season from late March to midMay had been piled in huge wilted rubbish heaps after sales slumped due to the coronavirus crisis We decided to harvest and destroy says Tulezi noting that the loss was massive After the Netherlands Kenya is the secondlargest flower supplier to Europe Due to the losses seasonal workers were laid off and more than a third of Kenya is roughly 150000 flower industry employees were forced to take paid or unpaid leave says Tulezi The situation has been equally tough in the auction halls of Royal Flora Holland in the Dutch town of Aalsmeer one of the world is largest flower trading centres where thousands of unwanted flowers had to be destroyed every single day Now in May relief can finally be felt Demand is increasing and exports are also increasing Mother is Day plays an important role here says van Schie In Kenya too demand has risen again in the past three weeks to around 65 per cent of normal conditions according to Tulezi Everyone benefits from the fact that florists and garden centres are reopening in many countries Especially in Holland where flowers only have short transport route to reach their customers the sighs of relief are almost audible The auction halls of Aalsmeer southwest of Amsterdam are bustling with activity again On the Monday before Mother is Day Royal Flora Holland made a turnover of 32 million euros 345 million dollars just 36 per cent less than on the same date last year And this even though 17 per cent less flowers were on auctioned meaning that prices have gone up But it is certainly no time for celebration Flower traders are cautious to forecast profits especially since the Mother is Day hype is followed by a slump each year This year the drop in sales is expected to be steeper than other years There will not be any big weddings due to the Covid19 crisis in the next few months for example In terms of recovery we are looking at the second or third month of 2021 predicts Tulezi Some tulip growers like Henk van der Slot from the Dutch town of Lisse remain optimistic however It could have been worse van der Slot told local newspaper Algemeen Dagblad People have more money to spend on flowers because they did not spend it on travel the tulip grower believes Flowers chocolate honey are particularly important in times of crisis things that make life more beautiful van der Slot added Editorial contactsEditing by Niels C Sorrells 49 30 2852 31472 internationaldpacom

proportions unless aid can reach those in dire need immediately warns the UN agency But the pandemic is only amplifying famine is causes which also need tackling Richard Ragan is responsible for feeding a city of one million people But it is no normal city it is a camp and the population is made up of Rohingya refugees Keeping them supplied meant 24000 people working in the camp and thousands of delivery vehicles coming and going daily Then along came the coronavirus Today we have got maybe 1000 people going into the camps sometimes fewer Around 400500 vehicles explains Ragan country director for the World Food Program WFP in Bangladesh We are moving food to the camps because we are trying to stockpile We are seeing prices for staples go up by as much as 30 to 40 For people who are really living on the poverty line it is really tough Beyond the camp is walls in the rest of Bangladesh there are 40 million without sufficient food Ragan reckons COVID19 and subsequent lockdowns will add 20 million more Worldwide the United Nations World Food Program is concerned the pandemic could double the number of people suffering starvation to 265 million If these people made up a country it would be the world is fifth largest by population Read more Bangladesh garment industry risks collapse Coronavirus as a catalyst The calculation comes after the WFP released its Global Report on Food Crises Over 233 pages it lays out the struggles of hundreds of millions of people across Africa Asia Latin America and Europe are facing to get enough food Addressing the UN Security Council the head of the WFP David Beasley said the world is facing multiple famines of biblical proportions if events continue as they are COVID19 has accelerated the plight of people across the globe The report highlights the main drivers of starvation in 2019 conflict weather extremes and economic shocks Locusts are also ravaging crops and vegetation across Africa and the Middle East People battling these events already have nothing to fall back on whether they move to refugee camps or stay put When a virus like this strikes the WFP says they are left completely open Read more Africa risks severe hunger crisis It is affecting different regions in different ways Lockdowns in Africa are preventing day laborers and farmers already living on or below the breadline from being able to harvest food or earn any money Many islands in the Caribbean which depend on food imports and tourism are facing steeply rising costs and lost income as the virus disrupts transports and shipping But even in this difficult picture particular points jump out especially for the WFP is Chief Economist Arif Husain There are 30 million people out there in places like Yemen Afghanistan Democratic Republic of the Congo Burkina Faso and South Sudan who almost completely rely on WFP food assistance to stay alive he says These are the people we are really concerned about If we are not there to help them no one is They will die As our Executive Director told the UN Security Council on Tuesday we could be looking at 300000 people dying every day for three months unless rapid action is taken to shore up food assistance for them The need for swift action is shared by Ragan in Bangladesh If you are a rickshaw worker or a day laborer right now life is really tough he says They do not have the cushion that we have in the West Aid organizations need money now Just at the time people require more assistance funding and donations to aid organizations are drying up Wealthier countries which would normally step in to provide support to the WFP are busy trying to mitigate possible recessions as they begin to come out of their own lockdowns Against this backdrop the WFP is trying to persuade donor countries to contribute funding as soon as possible so it can gather food and resources to help mitigate the crisis Altogether we need some 12 billion 11 billion for this year says Husain But its critically important that we receive 19 billion now so we can quickly bring forward food and cash assistance for at least the next three months in fragile places for the 30 million plus people in dire situations A need for solidarity The money alone will only be the start to getting starvation numbers down according to the WFP The organization is also calling for solidarity and efforts to help aid workers and end conflicts Stopping fighting would allow aid workers to get to more people and eliminate one of the main causes for people facing starvation Stopping wars would be a huge step forward argues Husain We need all parties involved in conflicts to give us swift and unimpeded humanitarian access to all the people out there who are on the edge of starvation so they can get the assistance that they need For Ragan help from the government is proving vital You are not even one generation removed from widescale famine in Bangladesh he explains They remember famine

that have already seen more than 600 people killed by thugs and security forces according to the Iraqi Commission for Human Rights entered their sixth month on Sunday A week after health authorities banned public gatherings in an effort to contain the virus protesters in Baghdad refused to leave Tahrir Square We see COVID19 as a small threat when we are being killed with guns and live bullets We have been facing death poverty and corruption since 2003 This is the real virus and I do not think we will find a cure activist and journalist Alqasem Ahmed said Despite determined efforts to contain the outbreak Iraq is health system has been undermined by decades of sanctions neglect and corruption and protest camps are exposed Health authorities hampered by neglected system Although Iraqi health authorities have been taking the threat of COVID19 seriously shortages in supplies equipment and staff and decades of sanctions and corruption have left the medical system in a shambles and are exacerbating the threat said Omar alDewachi a former doctor in Iraq who now specializes in the medical anthropology of the country at Rutgers University in the US Officials have banned public gatherings suspended work at some government ministries and ordered schools and restaurants in major cities to close World Health Organization WHO representative Adnan Nawar said the Health Ministry

thermometers being used at border crossings with the fake bomb detectors sold to the Iraqi government in 2008 But a recent Reuters report found that after years of war UN sanctions and corruption the medical system in general is suffering a crisis of neglect with doctors fleeing in their thousands a shortage of drugs and an allocated health budget of only 25 of the state is 1065 billion 958 billion revenue Activist Alqasem Ahmed said one suspected case had been turned away from two hospitals in Baghdad and a pharmacist in the city said people are worried about the Health Ministry is

there have been conflicting reports about whether crossings between the two countries have been fully closed The Iranian ambassador to Baghdad initially denied the border was closed on February 20 and

something that has consistently raised the ire of protesters who resent what they see as a powerful Iranian influence in their country Im not really convinced that they are closing these borders correctly or doing the proper procedures Dewachi the medical anthropologist said Iraq is highly vulnerable because Iran is linked to these corrupt parties and it will not allow the government to

medical stations to distribute hygiene products and advice even as they tend to injuries sustained under tear gas and live fire during demonstrations Having recently visited a protest camp Dewachi said One of the deepest moments I had was when I heard two guys saying Well you can die this way or you can die that way They were referring to how in Iraq you are constantly confronting death Liberating yourself from all this political and social repression which is a form of death compared to staying at home being silent and dying from something else you might as well choose the better

friendly and calm as he usually is He explained his humanitarian mission as the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization WHO and warned We shouldn t waste time pointing fingers Then suddenly his demeanor grew darker and everything he had just said seemed forgotten Tedros as he is commonly called said that he could handle a lot personally I don t give a damn he said about the death threats he has received but he would not remain silent when it comes to racist insults because they constitute an attack on all black people There was a smear campaign going on against him he said and he knew who was behind it This attack came from Taiwan he said and that the country s Foreign Ministry had even been aware of the campaign This kind of a display of anger is rare among diplomats especially since he couldn t substantiate his accusations But it underscored the extent to which the WHO head has come under pressure in the COVID19 crisis We don t do politics in WHO That s one of the mottos of the Genevabased organization which serves as a kind of health ministry for the United Nations and employs over 7000 people As the conflict over Taiwan shows however that position is proving harder than ever to maintain right now Taiwan would like to become the 195th member of the WHO and has a powerful ally in Donald Trump But China is opposed because the leadership in Beijing considers the island with its 24 million inhabitants to be part of the People s Republic of China The conflict has been building for years but since the outbreak of COVID19 it has taken on a new significance just like everything involving the WHO and its leader To better understand how the pandemic and the Taiwan conflict are connected however you have to take a look at the past The WHO is one of many international organizations founded after World War II Its goal was to make a healthy life possible everywhere in the world to implement medical standards and fight infectious diseases across any ideological boundaries Its greatest success was probably the eradication of small pox a bright moment for humanity in the midst of the Cold War When an epidemic runs the risk of flaring out of control somewhere in the world the Genevabased apparatus takes over global leadership of the response It has tackled viruses like the swine flu Ebola zika and now it is in the midst of COVID19 an unprecedented challenge An Easy Target But the WHO now finds itself having to deal with an American president unlike any other before him Trump has managed to drag the organization into his power games like a brute schoolyard bully It proved to be an easy target too as vulnerable and disadvantaged as it is The United States is the WHO s biggest financial backer with 400 million 360 million euros in contributions But Trump recently announced that he wanted to stop these payments for the foreseeable future and that his government would investigate the mistakes he claims the organization has made in fighting the virus He had already reached his verdict claiming that the WHO had failed in its basic duty as a result of it being too reliant on and too close to Beijing Trump claimed that the WHO had spread Chinese disinformation early in the epidemic and thus helped the virus spread To support this argument he could point to footage of DirectorGeneral Tedros during a Beijing visit in January Tedros had himself photographed with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and praised him effusively He said that China is setting a new standard for outbreak response without a single word of criticism of the Chinese s censorship of alarm bells over the virus rung by doctors in Wuhan And even after evidence of COVID19 s high levels of contagiousness appeared in Taiwan the WHO sent a calming message into the world Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of humantohuman transmission of the novel coronavirus It appears Trump wanted to create a distraction from his own mistakes in the fight against the coronavirus by attacking the WHO But the US president isn t totally wrong Australia immediately signed onto his criticism and called for a closer examination of the issue Japan s deputy prime minister even said that the WHO should be renamed the China Health Organization Tedros fought back in his own way He posted a series of oneword messages on Twitter Solidarity Humanity Unity Love Officials in Geneva say that he doesn t see any reason to justify himself A Fraught Political Environment German doctor Bernhard Schwartländer who as the chef de cabinet at the WHO is one of Tedros closest colleagues says his boss is tenacious and steadfast in his pursuit of his ideas and principles He says Tedros is not willing to make just any kind of deal and that his independence is what enables him survive even in a very fraught political environment It may be says Schwartländer that he could have expressed some things differently He says that once the coronavirus is under control one day the WHO will take a critical look back at its own actions Tedros he says was the first person to say this himself Before his appointment in 2017 Schwartländer headed the WHO s Beijing office for four years It was a great and exciting time for him he recalls adding that the Chinese listened to him and respected him even if he didn t say what they wanted to hear Like Tedros he sees the Chinese approach to fighting the pandemic as a success story overall Within a span of several weeks they beat the curve down completely Schwartländer says He claims that other countries could learn a lot from that In the early stages of the epidemic he says many were uneasy in Geneva When we saw the first numbers and images from Wuhan we thought this is going to be something of a Moloch that like Chernobyl something terrible is happening there But through their strict lockdown and construction of hospitals at breakneck speeds he says the country s leaders managed to avoid a total medical disaster When Tedros confidante speaks about China you can sense a lot of respect in his voice Tedros is the first African to lead the WHO The 55yearold biologist and immunologist is from Ethiopia where he served as the country s health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016 These were years in which China was making inroads into Africa sending in consultants giving out billions in loans and supporting infrastructure projects China had been particularly busy in Ethiopia The Chinese built and immediately bugged the headquarters of the African Union in the capital city of Addis Ababa and constructed the city s commuter rail network A political consultant who was stationed in Ethiopia as a highranking European diplomat and knows Tedros well describes him as a thoughtful person with balanced judgment He adds that he s a really nice guy in person The exdiplomat recalls that despite all of the influence that China bought itself in Ethiopia he had never noticed anything disreputable about Tedros That s not his style Kjetil Tronvoll a professor of peace and conflict studies in Norway has followed the WHO directorgeneral s career closely I first met him 20 years ago and he stood out had expertise he says But Tronvoll claims Tedros also made at least one mistake along the road When Ethiopia got hit by cholera outbreaks starting in 2006 and Tedros was the country s health minister he played down the situation Tedros claimed there weren t enough tests available to determine there was an epidemic But Tronvoll argues those words were likely steered by a decision by Ethiopia s leader to keep things under wraps Tedros stood out from the country s leadership at the time He belonged to the Tigray People s Liberation Front the most powerful group in Ethiopia between 1991 and 2019 But he was always a civilian and never an armed fighter This clearly set him apart says Tronvoll Anyone who has fought in combat as a teenager experiences terrible things that leave behind permanent scars Tedros served a repressive system run by leaders with military training But Tedros also transcended them as a foreign minister with a knack for charm Nevertheless his years serving a government with little space for freedom of expression and for human rights might have made him insensitive to those concerns How else could he have come up with the idea in the autumn after his election as WHO directorgeneral of making one of Africa s most notorious dictators a poster boy for his organization According to Tedros Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was appointed WHO goodwill ambassador because his country offers universal health care Tedros only withdrew the appointment following protests Tedros owes his election to become the WHO s director general in part to the support of the African nations for whom the World Health Organization is especially needed Its missions there are overseen from the headquarters of its Africa division in Brazzaville the capital of the Republic of Congo Emergency Coordinator Michel Yao runs his team from a fortresslike structure above the cataracts of the Livingston Falls A visit in February and later phone calls conveyed a sense of how the virus was spreading into new countries and what the WHO was undertaking to combat it The Strategic Health Operations Center had classified 47 countries into three categories but only eight countries were adequately prepared as of February At the time Yao said We can t send experts everywhere But they did what they could In late March the emergency coordinator sounded almost exasperated He said teams had been assembled but they hadn t been able to reach their destinations because most air travel in Africa had come to a halt By that point the virus had reached almost all African countries Then came a bit of good news although not from Brazzaville The first aid aircraft had taken off from Addis Ababa in midApril filled with medical aid supplies from a UN sister organization the World Food Program WFP Tedros sent a Twitter message to the head of the WFP reading Thank you my brother A New Modern WHO In chef of cabinet Schwartländer s view the cooperation with the WFP shows the face of a new modern WHO as conceived in Geneva a provider of fast concrete help in collaboration with many partners This includes other UN organizations states and private foundations he says He argues that it s about fostering a logistical network that can be used flexibly This includes for example a collaboration with Chinese billionaire Jack Ma the founder of the internet platform Alibaba His foundation has repeatedly made generous donations to us most recently 100 million surgical protective masks and a million masks of very high quality Schwartländer says The World Health Organization has been working with private benefactors for many years now Critics argue that this has created a dependency and that those who donate can determine how their money is spent They claim that these resources only rarely lead to a longterm improvement in health services The thirdlargest contributor to the organization s current budget is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with approximately 341 million Most recent large donations came from a benefit concert with Lady Gaga and other celebrities Bestselling author Yuval Noah Harari has donated 1 million The organization s total budget is 48 billion which sounds like a lot of money but is tight for a global health giant Mara Pillinger who works on international health policy at Georgetown University in Washington DC argues that the WHO budget is about as big as the budget of a large hospital in the US and most of the money is tied to projects Will China Fill Gap If Donald Trump now leaves a large financial gap in the WHO s budget as he has announced he would it could lead Xi Jinping to increase his country s share of the contributions Two special payments have already been announced by China Even if officials in Geneva might want to see things differently money is rarely nonpolitical But for the Taiwanese who have thus far admirably steered their country through the COVID19 crisis cooperation with the WHO would not get any easier if Beijing s influence were to continue to expand When the National People s Party with far friendlier policies toward China led the country from 2009 to 2016 it was at least allowed to have observer status at the World Health Assembly the most important meeting of WHO member states But after a change of governments in Taipei China no longer permitted this Leaders at the WHO say that Taiwan is integrated into the organization s coronavirus battle at the working level but an internal document from Taiwan s Foreign Ministry suggests otherwise It claims that the WHO has directly briefed the Taiwanese diseasecontrol authority only twice during the COVID19 crisis on Feb 6 and April 15 and argues that the country s expertise is not being tapped The Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance a Taiwanese NGO claims that even during such a severe pandemic outbreak crisis the interaction between Taiwan and WHO is still very limited let alone the interaction in usual times The only parties who could likely change that state of affairs are WHO s member countries That would require that they counter China s claim

Boko Haram has stepped up attacks in west Africa Islamists affiliated to the socalled IS also claimed new territory in Mozambique There are fears of more attacks Nigeria remains on high alert after security experts warned that terror groups could take advantage of the global focus on the pandemic and launch attacks especially in the Lake Chad Basin They further warned that African countries with scarce resources are at greater risk now that they have a new frontline on their doorstep the battle to stem the flow of COVID19 The COVID19 global infection is now more than 15 million in 184 countries on Thursday April 9 according to Johns Hopkins University Africa has so far not been hit as hard as other continents according to official figures But the continent saw a sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases between the last week of March and the first week of April climbing from around 1000 to over 8000 The socalled Islamic State IS and alQaeda released mixed statements last week On the one hand IS urged its followers to repent and take care of themselves because the coronavirus was a punishment from God for nonMuslims the news agency AP reported It also urged its followers to show no mercy and launch attacks in this time of crisis according to AP AlQaeda is statement on the other hand called on nonMuslims to use their time under lockdowns to learn about Islam Both statements are in total contrast to the guidelines set by the World Health Organization aimed at preventing the further spread of the coronavirus IS and alQaeda strategic alignment In northern Cameroon seven people were killed when two suspected Boko Haram suicide bombers attacked a village on Sunday police and a local official told the news agency AFP Chad suffered its deadliest toll in its battle against terrorism on March 23 when a Boko Haram faction allied to alQaeda attacked an army base on the Boma Peninsula in the Lake Chad region killing 92 heavily armed soldiers Chadian President Idris Deby visited the army base a day after the attack and said I have taken part in many operations but never in our history have we lost so many men at one time The Sahel country had

47 soldiers were killed local newspapers reported A terrorist organization in Mozambique allegedly allied to IS ransacked the strategic port city of Mocimboa da Praia on March 24 and designated it a part of the socalled caliphate The Washington Post had reported in late February that alQaeda and IS who are fighting each other in the Middle East are working together to take control of territory across a vast stretch of West Africa The Post cited sources in the United States and West Africa Fighters appear to be coordinating attacks and carving out mutually agreedupon areas of influence in the Sahel the strip of the land beneath the Sahara desert according to The Post MNJTF launches offensive Following the attacks the Multinational Joint Taskforce MNJTF which includes Nigeria Niger and Chad launched a major operation at the Tunbuns islands of Lake Chad against Boko Haram and ISWAP At a press conference in Abuja a spokesperson for the Nigerian army Brigadier General Bernard Onyeuko said that these heinous acts necessitated the contiguous nations of the Lake Chad basin to jointly launch this massive onslaught on the terrorists across the common borders The operation is an addition to the ongoing Operation Lafiya Dole in which Nigerian troops are battling the terrorists in the northeast Read also Opinion Boko Haram no end in sight New fighting fronts stretched resources

Security analyst Bulama Bukarti wrote in a blog post for the Londonbased Tony Blair Institute for Global Change that there are already indications that jihadi groups on the continent try to take advantage of the crisis to unleash violence and recruit members Already stretched resources currently earmarked for state security forces fighting violent extremists and the provision of healthcare and humanitarian supplies to communities in need may have to be diverted to deal with a widespread outbreak Bukarti wrote Read also Egypt launches new operation against Islamic State Foreign troops in Africa The increased attacks also come amid contradictory statements that the United States could cut down troops in West Africa New York Times journalist Eric Schmitt wrote The Trump administration is split over how to combat terrorists support allies and thwart global competitors in West Africa And the mixed messages out of Washington are confusing allies in Europe who are deeply committed to security in Africa as well as to military partners on the continent While we might like to pause our operations in Somalia because of the coronavirus the leaders of alQaeda alShabaab and ISIS have announced that they see this crisis as an opportunity to further their terrorist agenda the Military Times news website quoted Gen Stephen Townsend So we will continue to stand with and support our African partners he added Townsend also claims that a US airstrike killed a highranking alShabab leader last week Additionally the US has increased airstrikes against alShabab after the terrorists carried out a brazen raid on US airbases in Manda Bay Kenya and Baledogle in Somalia both in January Three Americans including a soldier were killed in the Manda Bay attack Last Friday eleven European countries including Germany announced the deployment of a special commando unit to Mali dubbed Takuba It adds to the high presence of forces already fighting terror organizations in West Africa which includes the UN mission in Mali MINUSMA the African G5 Sahelforce the Frenchled military operation Barkhane and the EU training mission EUTM However the high presence of foreign troops in West Africa has failed to halt the militants who are carrying out frequent and sophisticated attacks against local army bases and villages in Mali Niger and Burkina Faso According to Schmitt the Pentagon is weighing deep US troop cuts on the continent closing a new 110 million 108 million drone base and ending aid to French forces battling militants who are surging in Mali Niger and Burkina Faso Exploiting a humanitarian vacuum The US has about 1400 troops in West Africa providing intelligence and drone support to local and French forces on the ground A further 4400 American troops are deployed in East Africato support African Union troops fighting alShabab According to security analyst Bulama Bukarti terrorist organizations could exploit the humanitarian vacuum created by the coronavirus outbreak These groups might increase service provision stepping in where the state is failing in medical water and food provisions to build popular support for their cause and protostates

facilities to their limits In Kenya the health system which is severely stressed by diseases such as malaria cholera HIVAids is already overwhelmed by the crisis said Kathryn Tätzsch of the humanitarian organization World Vision in Nairobi The number of patients in Kenya with potentially fatal pneumonia has been on the increase since January and is currently at just under 300 There are far too few beds in ICUs and the care for a patient including protective clothing costs 1200 1300 per day That is immense for one system that is already struggling with many problems Tätzsch told DW Can Africa become the next epicenter of the pandemic The WHO has warned that subSaharan Africa could become the next epicenter of the pandemic The global health body is model calculations assume at least 300000 Africans could succumb to the virus and more than 30 million could slip into extreme poverty And there is another problem Test capacities are limited many countries have only now begun rolling out a few dozen tests Kenya started to do so just recently But the estimated number of unreported cases is much higher said Tätzsch The situation is similar in Kano in northern Nigeria

at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine LSHTM The data on the number of people infected with the coronavirus and treatment capacities in Africa is very incomplete said Professor Francesco Checci This means that the number of those infected do not provide a very reliable source of how strongly the virus is being transmitted It is also difficult to determine to what extent

Africa is understaffed and poorly equipped so the starting point for data collection is very poor according to Checci Fortunately there are ways to work around the data shortage so that the WHO the African Union and African governments can make decisions You can use mathematical models to predict trends and choose strategies to respond to the crisis But that also has its own problems The current forecasts for the pandemic in Africa are based on evaluations of the COVID19 in Europe and China according to Checci In Africa however the situation could develop differently for example through more infections in urban poor areas than in rural areas In spite of all the uncertainty one thing is clear If we look at the prognosis for infections in Africa it is clear with a few exceptions like South Africa that we are standing in front of a huge mountain when we compare the expected critical cases with the available ICU beds Checci told DW Read more Coronavirus The lessons to learn from Ebola The health sector in subSaharan Africa is poorly equipped More emphasis on prevention The main focus of African governments is on the provision of better healthcare but Checci see that as problematic It is almost not feasible given the number of patients to be expected Nobody knows exactly to what extent Africa is prepared for the pandemic Therefore Checci sees prevention as the only sensible approach to reduce transmission of the coronavirus He believes that measures such as selfisolation social distancing and protecting highrisk groups should be made a priority If all three strategies are well combined and followed they will provide an opportunity for African governments to reduce the pressure on their healthcare systems and cut death tolls without months of curfews and the economic damage that could possibly be worse than the virus itself said Checci

society being dismantled or having to flee into exile said Stephanie Wolters a researcher with the South African Institute for International Affairs SAIIA You have seen a complete repression of the political media you have seen repression of the opposition In 2015 violence forced many to flee Burundi Eyes of the world shut out Burundi announced a 14day quarantine requirement for any any observers entering the country due to the coronavirus pandemic Coming from a government which has consistently downplayed the crisis at home this can only be seen as a ploy to legitimize elections

close to the opposition Read more Burundi rejects AU is troop pullout decision Pierre Nkurunziza is 15 years in office have been marred by human rights abuses Call for dialogue The UN and AU on Sunday

of consensual and peaceful elections The tense situation in Burundi has raised fears that exacerbated tensions could lead to more violence during and after the election According to the Burundian government three people have been killed since the campaign started It raises concerns about what may happen one citizen told DW Others are not ready to give up hope yet My expectations are first of all peaceful transparent and democratic elections My second expectation is a good and competent leader from those elections said another That seems unlikely as the country is turning into an

for elections to be postponed for a number of reasons including suspicion that Ndayishimiye is complicit in alleged crimes against humanity that left 1200 dead since 2015 and are currently being investigated by the UN and the International Criminal Court But international pressure seems to have little effect in Burundi There is a kind of Burundian patriotism that rejects any form of interference in the country is affairs said Onesphore Sematumba from the International Crisis Group The policy of confrontation is part of a strategy of deliberate isolation which has helped Nkurunziza to maintain total control over the country is politics he added Burundi is listed by the World Bank as one of the three poorest countries in the world No free and fair elections Would the opposition led by Agathon Rwasa win a free and fair election While she does not like to speculate Stephanie Wolters told DW I think there is obviously real desire to see Burundi change for the better

The impact from the last five years have been catastrophic for Burundians on all levels from a surge in measles and malaria cases to an economic downturn with loss of jobs and income she said Burundi has a long history of ethnic violence between its Hutu and Tutsi communities According to Wolters while the ruling party is ethnically dominated by the Hutu majority the ethnic question in Burundi is not nearly as important to people as political parties might like to think it is My guess is that people would not like to vote for a party which destroyed their livelihoods and made life miserable

crisis the company is risking its reputation as it gets into a muddy battle with the US government How does the richest country in the world run out of a mask that costs 75 cents Stefan Beutelsbacher New York While the mysterious pathogen made its way through Wuhan 20 engineers met on the other side of the world in a factory in South Dakota It did not take long before it was clear to everyone what was now threatening a new XFactor The team of the American company 3M had received a call from the headquarters on that January day They were told to ramp up production to start all idle machines immediately 3M short for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company is a giant that produces 50000 different goods Its sticky notes and adhesive tapes are particularly wellknown But in South Dakota something else is being produced an N95 breathing mask And management believes that it will soon be in great demand The engineers were preparing for a multiplication of demand the Xfactor as they call it 3M had already experienced several of these For example when Ebola SARS and swine flu were rampant Also after floods earthquakes and hurricanes Where viruses or dirt fly through the air the need for mouthguards increases dramatically And 3M is the largest manufacturer But Corona the group in South Dakota soon realized surpasses previous disasters We immediately started all the tapes the company said on request but still we will not be able to supply enough masks 3M nearly 120 years old has rarely been the focus of attention Now all America knows the acronym Citizens hunt for the N95 filter in supermarkets and pharmacies It is considered the best face mask in the world the RollsRoyce of masks But in the past few days 3M has risked its reputation as managers got into a muddy battle with the government It is all about greed and lies And about how America the richest nation on earth can run out of a product that costs 75 cents According to forecasts the USA will need three billion N95 masks in the coming weeks Available are 30 million or about one percent The country is currently the centre of the corona pandemic more than 360000 citizens have tested positive for the virus and more than 15000 have died The worst hit is New York where almost 5000 people have lost the fight against Covid19 Doctors say that the pathogen spreads five times faster in this densely populated metropolis than in other parts of the United States Many Americans now hope for 3M Because the company has experience It designed its first masks 50 years ago initially for miners and construction workers Later they woven tighter filters for doctors and nurses In the SARS crisis of 2002 for the first time employees were unable to keep up with production So 3M decided to equip its factories with a hidden reserve With machines that are only started up when demand explodes in other words when there is an Xfactor And the idea apparently works Last month 3M produced about 100 million masks twice as many as usual Some Americans already celebrated boss Michael Roman an electrical engineer who has been with the company for 30 years as a hero There are other producers in the USA Honeywell and Medicom for example but none of them has the capacity of 3M And yet the efforts are not enough The hospitals stocks are almost exhausted Many are now asking citizens to sew masks and donate them Even if they do not provide as good protection as an N95 filter which repels 95 percent of all particles even those that are 100 times thinner than a hair Masks are now treated like diamonds in America We lock away our mouthguards says Jennifer Lighter a doctor at Langone Hospital in New York In addition all employees have been asked to use the filters not just once as intended but until they are moist or cracked The need is particularly great at Lighter is Hospital Until now the equipment has been sourced from Hubei the very Chinese province where the corona virus broke out What is happening at Langone Hospital illustrates one problem that the world depends on mouthguards from China Half of all filters are made there In recent years the mask industry has imitated the manufacturers of trousers and Tshirts and moved its production to the Far East where wages are cheaper This is now taking its revenge When the corona virus broke out China collected many filters The 3M factories in the country were practically nationalised overnight according to the US government And the factories in America could not fill the gap The battle for the masks is now in full swing The US states are trying to outbid each other 3M claims they have not raised prices But the dealers who resell the masks are obviously taking advantage of the hardship New York now often has to pay more than seven dollars a piece for N95 filters about ten times as much as before And some hospitals are so desperate that they are looking around the black market But this shortage is probably not only China is fault There is the White House complains another reason namely that 3M prefers to do business with foreign countries rather than with its home country So the managers allegedly did not want to send masks from a factory in Singapore to America but to countries in Asia that offered more money Donald Trump was furious We are extremely disappointed in 3M the US president recently complained they should have looked after us first Trump is now using a 1950 law dating from the time of the Korean War to force 3M to produce more for the domestic market He wants to prevent he said unscrupulous profiteers of the crisis from exporting material that America desperately needs 3M fought back The company issued a statement that made the government look unscrupulous The White House 3M said had also demanded that no more masks be exported to Canada in other words to America is closest ally its best friend This could have significant humanitarian consequences there Trump is trade advisor Peter Navarro then accused 3M of waging a propaganda war All we hear from the company is lies Navarro railed on television at prime time The Canada thing is absolutely not true Now there is a ceasefire They made a deal that week CEO Roman promised to produce 166 million masks for the United States The 3M saga has a happy ending Trump cheered But will this really help the country Hardly if the scenario occurs that doctors warn of when America actually needs three billion filters There could be no talk of a happy ending then The government has itself to blame for this It contributed to the emergency After the attacks of September 11 2001 the USA probably under a feeling of threat stored 104 million N95 masks But 100 million of these were consumed eight years later in the fight against swine flu And under Barack Obama the authorities failed to replenish the reserve Some of the money earmarked for protective equipment was lost in the budget battles Republicans and Democrats waged in the early Obama years And the money that was eventually released went into suits that repel biological weapons and radioactive radiation something that was apparently more feared than a new pandemic Simple masks according to experts at the time could be bought quickly in case of an emergency Politicians probably never thought that a virus could spread all over the world and that a global battle for face masks would break out Against all this against nationalizations in China failures of the US government and questionable decisions of the own company management the engineers in South Dakota will not be able to do much against all this Even if they now keep the machines in their factory running around the clock We will not be able to supply enough masks Statement from 3M Object of desire The whole world is on the hunt for protective masks from 3M A policeman with a mask in New York The metropolis is the epicenter of the corona crisis in the USA Note This article has been

to difficulties but the coronavirus pandemic has created yet another one with Italy and Malta officially closing their ports to them That fact has only worsened an already bad situation stemming from a lack of consensus among EU member states on refugee and asylum policy The Maltese government for its part said that it had no choice but to close its ports because it simply lacks the capacity to operate them as most of the countrys energies are currently focused on combating the COVID19 pandemic Illegal to close borders to asylumseekers At the moment most EU member states have closed their borders EU migration expert Raphael Bossong of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs SWP says that is a legitimate course of action during a crisis such as that presented by the coronavirus Bossong is a migration expert But that does not mean states can simply turn away those seeking help he says If a vessel is carrying asylumseekers at sea then an exception must be made and the ship be allowed to enter port says Bossong Standoff off Sicily Maritime law stipulates that people rescued at sea must be taken to the closest safe harbor Private rescue ships like the Alan Kurdi operated by the organization SeaEye already had difficulties gaining entrance to safe harbors before the coronavirus began but now it has become nearly impossible for them to get in Currently the Alan Kurdi is anchored off the coast of Sicily where its crew and 149 refugees have been waiting for a resolution to their dilemma for more than a week On April 6 crew members from the Alan Kurdi rescued 68 migrants in the Mediterranean Dark scenes are playing out in Maltese waters too On Wednesday five drowned bodies were recovered at sea The dead were said to have been passengers on a rubber boat full of refugees According to the International Organization for Migration IOM 51 of those refugees were picked up by a passing merchant ship and handed over to the Libyan coast guard Authorities say the rescued are currently in a camp in Tripoli returned to the capital of a country in the grips of a civil war Rescuers accusations Malta and Italy have repeatedly attempted to curtail freedom of movement for private rescue ships in the past Now nongovernmental organizations NGOs accuse Rome and Valletta of misusing the coronavirus pandemic for political purposes Oliver Kulikowski of the organization Sea Watch says that although Italy has been hardhit by the crisis this does not give politicians there an excuse to ignore human rights and maritime laws Regardless of the situation in Europe people are still trying to escape Libya where torture and human rights abuses are the order of the day in vessels not fit for the journey says Kulikowski The European Union has been trying to keep refugees and migrants from making the dangerous journey to its shores for years To do so it has counted heavily on cooperation from Libyan authorities One tactic employed has been to task the Libyan coast guard with picking up refugees headed to Europe and returning them to Libya Those taken back are often tortured and blackmailed Tripoli has also been the scene of repeated clashes between Libya is internationally recognized government and opposition rebels since April 2019 Many regions in the country are unsafe The Libyan government recently acknowledged that fact when it refused to let migrants disembark in the port of Tripoli a few days ago because it simply was dangerous for them to do so Recent skirmishes in the capital led the government to declare the port unsafe Libyan soldiers and rebels have clashed in the capital of Tripoli An impossible situation for refugees Tom Garofalo of the International Rescue Committee IRC agrees with the assessment that returned migrants and refugees are not safe in Libya It is definitely the case that it is it can be very dangerous to bring people back into Tripoli port because of the current fighting but that is that there is no other alternative Garofalo said The European ports are not accepting them There is no place for them to go And they are brought back to Libya It is estimated that as many as 600000 refugees are in the North African country at the moment though not all of them want to continue on to Europe Garofalo says He says many of them came to Libya to earn money to live on with many hoping to return home as soon as possible He says those people are now in an impossible situation in which they do not know when they will be able to leave the wartorn country and are now simply trying to survive Garofalo warns that increasing violence paired with the coronavirus could lead many refugees and migrants to flee yet again In an attempt to keep them from setting out for Europe Malta has proposed an EU aid package to assist Libya The plan would provide at least 100 million 109 million worth of food medicine and medical equipment Desperate need for international solidarity I think that it is important to support the Libyan government and to build on the strong points to help them to deal with this crisis Garofalo says But a much better option would be for the international community including Malta Italy UK France Germany everybody to look more pragmatically at how to provide safe haven and to open up to this to these vulnerable people particularly at a time when we are trying to foster international solidarity to deal with this epidemic Sea Watch is Kulikowski says the current situation has handcuffed private rescue organizations adding The European Union refuses to rescue people preferring to let them drown if they cannot reach the European coast on their own In October 2019 a clear majority of European parliamentarians rejected a proposal that would have granted rescue organizations more rights That combined with a lack of international solidarity in the face of increasingly drastic measures by Mediterranean countries has only made a dangerous journey deadlier still

the continent have closed borders and halting air traffic More than 30 of Africa is 57 international airports have closed or severely limited flights according the the US State Department Flight trackers show only a few planes crossing over the African continent with many of them being domestic flights Low satisfaction even before COVID19 A survey by the panAfrican Afrobarometer research network recently showed that more than half of all Africans go without the necessary medical care at least once in a given year Four in 10 patients experience long waits or never receive care while about one in eight recounts having to pay a bribe in order to obtain treatment Africans identify health as the secondmost important national problem their governments should address according to Afrobarometer Spending on health care in Africa is roughly 5 of gross domestic product about half the global average Experts are warning that many countries will be overwhelmed if the coronavirus spreads Ethiopia had just three hospital beds per 10000 people in 2015 according to the World Health Organization Central African Republic has three ventilators in total and in Zimbabwe doctors have reported doing barehanded surgeries for lack of gloves However with Africa is elite now grounded at home there is hope they will start spending more money on local medical facilities Small budgets for health care in Nigeria In Nigeria about 41 report difficulties in obtaining medical care according to the Afrobarometer survey This does not come as a surprise given the low health care expenditures by the government in recent years despite previous agreements In 2001 African heads of governments came together in Abuja Nigeria and agreed that a minimum of 15 of the national budget of each country should be ploughed into the health sector Yet the reality looks very different in Nigeria and many other countries In fact in the last three years it has been hovering around 39 in Nigeria So that is far away from where we are supposed to be says Dr Osama Enabulele the former president of the Nigerian Medical Association This is further highlighted in the fact that about 60 of all Nigerians seek medical treatment at private clinics rather than public hospitals Read moreNigerian President Buhari returns home after medical treatment In the face of the coronavirus pandemic the government and private donors have been making efforts to improve the situation For example initially the country only had five testing facilities four of them public and one of them private This number has now been raised to nine Some state governments for instance have gone ahead to procure as many as 20 ventilators from a base of about one or two Enabulele says Outside investments to the health care system are helping to provide additional protective equipment testing kits and ventilators he says We have been losing around 2 billion 915 million annually on account of medical tourism and that obviously does not help upscale activities programs projects and activities in the health infrastructure in our country says Enabulele The COVID19 travel bans offer an opportunity he says I see this experience as one that will get the elites and especially the rich ones to now commit themselves more to providing for the health sector Zimbabwe is elite steps in Frozen medical posts basic medicine shortages lack of water queues at hospitals and doctors on strike Zimbabwe is health care system was in bad shape and then came COVID19 says Blessing Gwanyira of the Hararebased NGO Citizens Health Watch In Zimbabwe the COVID19 pandemic has exacerbated a health care crisis that has been going on for years There are currently 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and only a single testing facility in the whole country at Wilkins Hospital in Harare Thirtyyearold Zororo Makamba a wellknown journalist was the first recorded death related to COVID19 He was being treated at Wilkins Hospital and his brother has since reported on the dire conditions at the facility The lack of plugs prevented the use of a ventilator and essential medicine had to be sourced by Makamba is family Recently the government unfroze 4000 posts for health workers We still have nurses who are not going to work because they do not have protective clothing says Gwanyira This has been an issue even prior to the COVID19 outbreak They did not have water to wash alcohol rubs the swabs The lack of the basics such as water and electricity have strained the health care system for years Gwanyira says Now she is witnessing how different the rich are stepping in to help Telecommunications mogul Strive Masiyiwa has donated 45 ventilators to public hospitals A leading fuel company Sakunda Holdings is involved in the refurbishing and upgrading two hospitals in Harare However Gwanyira is concerned that these hospitals will only be accessible to those who can afford treatment Health care aid restricted While there is a growing hope that investments in the health care system will rise due to a stranded elite the measures against the spread of COVID19 have also had adverse implications Travel restrictions have had a troubling side effect aid organizations are struggling to keep supplies and personnel moving in a region where millions rely on outside help for basic care The travel restrictions that have been put in place by many governments jeopardize our ability to get our staff and our humanitarian aid where they are needed says Patrick Youssef the incoming regional director for Africa of the International Committee of the Red Cross Some organizations including Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF say they rushed personnel into some places before the border closures and have supplies to keep facilities running for the coming weeks because governments have kept borders open for humanitarian aid As COVID19 effectively pushes the rich to invest in local medical infrastructure an opportunity to fix issues around health care

Some would say Gaza The coastal enclave on the eastern Mediterranean is considered one of the most denselypopulated areas and UN officials have described its health care system as a crisis waiting to happen Although public health authorities in the Gaza Strip have yet to announce a case of the novel coronavirus COVID19 observers believe it is only a matter of time as the pandemic sweeps across the globe We are truly worried because the overall health structure in Gaza is already weak because of the recurrent conflicts and because of nearly 14 years of blockade UN Relief and Works Agency UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told DW Read more EU closes borders to foreigners to halt coronavirus spread What to know In the West Bank public health authorities have confirmed more than 40 cases Looming crisis The confluence of conflict and blockade has left local health authorities illprepared for an outbreak of the magnitude currently seen in other countries with Gaza in dire need of disinfectants protective gear for medical staff and lifesaving medicines according to the UNRWA The UN agency is charged with providing assistance and protection to Palestinian refugees But funding cuts spurred by the Trump administration has left it in a particularly vulnerable position Given the situation the agency has requested 14 million 128 million for emergency preparedness and response operations in anticipation of an outbreak It really is not much to ask for in the face of the possible humanitarian catastrophe Tamara said We really hope that there will be no outbreak in Gaza we truly hope it can be averted but we know that being under blockade does not mean that the virus will not cross into Gaza Read more Israel to use counterterror tools to track quarantine breakers Israel is responsibility But some argue that the responsibility for dealing with such an outbreak falls on Israeli authorities given their status under international law as the occupying power a term enshrined in UN resolutions but contested by the Israeli government Earlier this week international and human rights lawyer Shannon Maree Torrens penned an oped in the Tel Avivbased newspaper Haaretz urging Israel along with local authorities and the international community to take responsibility for what she described as one of the world is most at risk populations However if Israel failed to do so then neighboring Egypt would have to step in for example by providing passage to those in need of intensive care Torrens told DW But Egyptian authorities are also dealing with their own severelyunderreported outbreak For now the unfolding situation in Gaza is primarily Israel is responsibility Torrens said Israel must focus on assisting with the testing of those in Gaza coordinating with Palestinian leaders and providing health care to affected individuals Read more Coronavirus Is Egypt suppressing the true outbreak figures Transcending borders On the Israeli side some precautions are being taken The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories COGAT of the Israeli Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment However COGAT civil affairs chief Colonel Sharon Biton said last week that his office and the Palestinian Authorities are cooperating closely and effectively to manage the outbreak of the virus including Gaza Biton noted that the

he talks about the unrest in the US and Europe is inferiority Andrea Seibel TD Robert D Kaplan is a geostrategist and author of 19 books His new work The Good American The Epic Life of Bob Gersony the US Governments Greatest Humanitarian will be published in October He holds the Robert StrauszHupéhair in Geopolitics at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia WORLD What is the Corona crisis in your eyes beyond the fact that it is an unpredictable pandemic Robert Kaplan For me it represents the historical upheaval between Globalisation 10 and Globalisation 20 The first globalisation was an optimistic narrative free trade democracy growing middle classes a unifying world and the emergence of a global elite The second globalization on the other hand has a pessimistic tone protectionism middleclass fear authoritarianism in a world that has become fragile along with the rivalries of the superpowers The corona virus is a divisive force in the USA within Europe and between major powers As if Corona was not enough another danger is currently spreading in America racist violence and also violent counterprotests Which once again increases the division of the country into lunacy What America has to cope with is not the unrest itself for it is a shock consequence of Covid19 the first shock being the lockdown that threw back the existence of so many to a lonely digital world Jobs are lost no normal social interaction is possible So there was this explosion of rage frustration and alienation Because you locked people up in the middle of an economic collapse you set the stage for violent anarchists Of course the reason for the initial protests was right and justified But now the public is calling for Law and Order because the protest has become something else After four years of Trump America has lost reputation and fame There is no longer any American leadership role in the world How could a single person cause such damage The story revolves around two things huge powers and impact and the Shakespearean drama that individuals cause Trump stands for the latter how an individual can be a world historical figure even if he knows nothing about history That is not so unusual What would the 20th century have been without Hitler Stalin or Einstein Individuals like Trump have enormous superpersonal powers within them that virtually catapult them to power The America that Trump embodies is the one that the global elite has never set foot on A few weeks ago Mathias Döfner CEO of the WELT parent company Axel Springer put forward the thesis in an essay that the world must choose either America or China There is no third way he said which the Europeans are so keen to take as a mediator Is he right If only it were that simple Not only China is pushing for Europe but also the Russians If Putin completes the Nordstream 2 pipeline it will subtly undermine the independence of Western European foreign policy no matter what politicians may say to the contrary Gas has replaced the role of the Red Army in Europe China is particularly infiltrating the economies of southern Europe Europe has always liked to talk about unity and human rights But without American leadership Europe will be neutralised and ultimately become the western offshoot of a RussianChinese dominated Eurasia But how can one form of coalition or cooperation with an America that is laughed at and whose opinion counts for less and less This is the ultimate tragic question From 1945 to 2016 the transatlantic alliance was morally and militarily the most successful alliance in world history But even such successful alliances fall victim to contradictions over time That is somehow natural The result was a populist American revolt against the postwar world order and as a result Donald Trump Europe must nevertheless continue to work with America because it is the world is strongest economy and military power You can always say Trump is not America just as Russia is not Putin and China is not Xi Jinping But these men have left their mark on their societies They are in fact prototypical representatives of their societies as they are today America is a country of deep resentment against the economic elite and China is one of fierce nationalism and pride And Russia A country of cynicism and piercing chaos Author Anne Applebaum has just published an essay in The Atlantic entitled History will judge her According to her Trump holds America hostage he is like an occupying force of American democracy and the Republicans are collaborators without decency or conscience The Republican Party has long been aware of the change in the electorate Over the years their standard of living has fallen many have been capped by globalization and the Chinese have been at an advantage Like Trump no other Republican candidate has appealed to this clientele I have no sympathy for Trump but I can understand the needs of those who still stand by him Is America a failed state as the journalist and author George Packer recently wrote Do you share this fatalism and if not which I hope you do where is the other America the liberal democratic creative the one of honor decency institutions and leadership America is not a failed state Federalism is strong and alive That the individual states exercise real power has been demonstrated in this crisis The President has damaged the institutions in Washington but not to an extent that could not be repaired after four years in office We should not exaggerate The US is selfsufficient in energy it has plenty of natural resources an admirable entrepreneurial culture and two oceans to protect it I am far from being a supporter of talk of permanent American decline The rise and fall of great powers can the latter also happen out of stupidity vanity or lack of humility If Donald Trump is reelected we could witness the decline of a great power But the key is not the person who will be elected in November but whether the election result is accepted by the losing side If this does not happen America could be facing massive civil unrest Many intellectuals look at the EU with almost romantic verve Nothing works without it nothing is without it Yet Europe is far from being a unified structure even in the form of a superpower The nation state is still the familiar and culturally acceptable form of expression Europe is once again experiencing an existential crisis Each state cares more for itself than for any other There is no real panEuropean selfinterest The states of the Calvinist North are tired of paying for the Mediterranean South This has made Corona even worse Yet the European Union is a truly ambitious undertaking because it has tried to unite different imperial areas which moreover have completely different patterns of development the Carolingian and Prussian in the north and the Byzantine and Ottoman in the south Is China the winner of the current crisis or is it not exposed to the same instabilities and imponderables as other major powers China the US and Russia are weakened by Corona But in relative terms China is the most likely to recover its state capitalism is dynamic and ready to buy up rundown companies in the developed world Its Silk Road initiative may be problematic but at least it follows an overall strategy The US under Trump on the other hand has no inspiring ideas for its power base Does the international order of the 21st century need superpowers at all or are we not experiencing completely different forms of relevance and power such as the digital giants In any case the international order needs a superpower or several powers Power in the geopolitical sense means power of persuasion or even coercion This is impossible without a credible military And the tech giants do not have that I am skeptical that they are interested in more than profit whatever their CEOs say in speeches Hard power is as crucial in the 21st century as it is in the 20th Maybe the tech giants hold the key to cyber weapons But decisions continue to be made by national leaders who combine these weapons with conventional ones The crisis of democracy has many faces Which one is most alien to you Democracy is not a movement but a form of government like authoritarianism Its quality depends on moral virtues which are not in opposition to but in accordance with the right of the people to choose their own representatives It is therefore in other words possible to have illiberal government and majority tyranny within a democratic system Democracy is nevertheless the least deficient form of all systems of government And therein always lies hope How do you see Germany Is it really relevant For 75 years the country has developed well and built an exemplary democracy and economy only under US protection and after 1989 as a state on the way to a panEuropean identity But now that Europe is unity is being lost and the US alliance is a thing of the past Germany has to forge a healthy nationalism for the first time since Hitler A nationalism that does not sell itself to Russia and China and on the other hand has a vision for Europe As the largest and most prosperous country in Europe Germany has no choice but to lead If Donald Trump loses the elections this fall Will we be able to forget him and move on And will America be great again but in a different way from Trump is Trump as I said before is a historical figure He will not be forgotten Because he changed America he changed the world But the United States may well recover from a Trump term But there is no going back to a pretrump term even if he loses What if he wins again Then we will have a world of dramatic tension between America and China A Europe that is neutral in the face of Russian and Chinese economic aggression and much unrest and uprising in the rest of the world It will be a new world of anarchy more

the chancellery against the government is measures to curb the spread of COVID19 According to various media reports they accused lawmakers of triggering panic and of supposedly wanting to force vaccinations on people But this was not in Berlin it was in front of the Austrian chancellery in Vienna The demonstration took place on May 1 with Austrian newspaper Der Standard reporting it was the second of its kind The leader of Austria is Identitarian movement Martin Sellner was also in attendance The Initiative for EvidenceBased Corona Information which organized the protests was expected to show up for another demonstration in Vienna for May 14 Read more In Germany vaccine fears spark conspiracy theories The Vienna protest is one of the few examples outside Germany where people who would not have much in common were it not for COVID19 are forming an unlikely alliance These demonstrations have drawn people from across the spectrum conspiracy theorists antidemocracy activists those who are against vaccinations and opponents of 5G mobile networks among others Protests all over the world Other countries have seen demonstrations against measures introduced to curb the spread of COVID19 but they have largely been of a different kind In Poland people who commute across the border for work joined hoteliers in the streets to call for a return of freedom of movement in the EU And in Warsaw last weekend police carried out arrests during a protest calling for the economy to be reopened Last month several days of unrest were triggered in the workingclass suburbs of Paris after a motorcyclist was injured in a collision with a police car door Eyewitnesses have alleged that police had opened the door deliberately a charge the police have denied leading protesters to riot against police violence and the social disparities highlighted by the lockdown measures An investigation is underway Read more When will the second wave of infections hit In the Slovenian capital Ljubljana and other major cities thousands took to their bikes last week to protest Prime Minister Janez Jansa is government by ringing their bells They accused the government of misappropriating funds in the procurement of personal protective equipment In Ljubljana thousands took to their bikes last week to protest Prime Minister Janez Jansa is government Though protests in other countries may have seen some conspiracy theorists on the fringes they seem to be less vocal and numerous than those joining the demonstrations in Germany In London for example an antilockdown protest in early May joined by some anti5G demonstrators only attracted about 40odd people In Germany political scientists conducting research into the most recent protests have drawn comparisons with the Vigils for Peace that were triggered by the proRussian unrest in Ukraine in 2014 Though they began as a protest movement for peace the events soon attracted people with an antiUS worldview and others with farright tendencies antiSemites and conspiracy theorists The way in which protest is expressed can be viewed from a German cultural perspective said Jan Rathje an expert on antiSemitism and conspiracy theories at the Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin As in 2014 there is a rapprochement between people who would describe themselves as being on the left and others who are right wing or even far right They are coming together against those in charge against the great conspiracy that they are trying to avert and resist Parallels between US Germany Increasingly German rightwing extremists and conspiracy theorists are communicating with likeminded people in other countries This was the case for Stefan B who introduced himself as Anon in a video he made and posted online before going out on a rampage and attempting to attack a Halle synagogue in October 2019 When he was unable to enter the building and kill as many Jewish worshippers as possible he shot dead a passerby before going into a kebab shop where he killed a customer Two more people were injured as he tried to escape Read more Politicians worry about radicalization at antilockdown protests Anon has become a code for rightwing extremists on social media In 2017 a supposed highranking US official claimed to have Q clearance access to classified information involving the US government and its opponents and made allegations of conspiracies involving US government agencies QAnon has since developed into a farright conspiracy theory focused on the belief that President Donald Trump is fighting a secret campaign against a child sex trafficking ring and members of the deep state including former President Barack Obama former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the billionaire philanthropist George Soros which QAnon has accused of planning a coup The QAnon farright conspiracy theory has made appearances at recent protests in Germany Followers of the movement see Trump as a liberator and often hold up Q signs and posters at public events These have also been seen at recent protests against lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID19 in the US where armed libertarians were out en masse According to Rathje this development in the US was nothing new We have seen these armed militias occupying buildings in the past he said The difference between the situation in the US and Germany he said was that in the US individualistic libertarians tend to be at the forefront of the protests whereas in Germany there is an element of national community at play What the protesters all shared was the idea that there is a big majority and a small minority which is conspiring to control and manipulate the majority he said To support their worldview conspiracy theorists often post edited videos of protests on YouTube Opting for solemn soundtracks they take footage of various protests in the US Canada and Germany along with material from Slovenia Poland Lebanon and Hong Kong for example deceptively stringing them together in such a way to make it seem that everyone is involved in the great global awakening ulliCoronavirus How refugee camps and slums are dealing with hygiene Yemen Yemen is home

spread of COVID19 aid organizations are rushing to stop the most vulnerable being shut off from desperately needed help African nations are imposing strict restrictions to try to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus on the continent which now has some 3400 reported cases in 46 countries There are fears the virus could ravage communities already hard hit by conflict poverty and poor health services On top of this work stoppages imposed by shutdowns also pose an existential threat to those living a handtomouth existence Local and international organizations are scrambling to find ways to plan ahead repurpose and be creative in how they can continue to help those most in need Beating blocked borders For the past three years southern Africa has been in the grips of an unprecedented drought that has left around 45 million people in the region struggling to find enough food to eat Some 81 million more in the region in countries such as Zambia Malawi Zimbabwe and South Africa are completely dependent on food aid from the World Food Program WFP Much of this aid flows through South Africa But last week South Africa closed 35 land crossings and two sea ports in an effort to curb the spread of COVID19 with more than 1000 cases reported in the country on Friday March 27 Goods including food aid can still to cross through the borders that remain open At the moment food movements have continued as normal through South Africa Lola Castro regional director for WFP Southern Africa told the New Humanitarian What we are hoping is that the transporters will continue to be engaged and not be afraid to move around the region But WFP is making contingency plans in case more ports and land crossings close because of the coronavirus The UN agency is asking donors for funding in advance so that it can buy food and move it before any problem happens with shipping lines Castro is quoted by the New Humanitarian as saying As the airlines are closing down we hope the shipping lines will not be affected Building up stockpiles In Zimbabwe where 4 million people rely on WFP aid the organization is also planning to stockpile three months worth of food supplies This would is ensure they can cover extra needs that the arrival of COVID19 and shutdowns might bring We have just received 33000 metric tons of cereals from Mexico This has just arrived in Beira in Mozambique and will see us through until the end of April Claire Nevill WFP spokesperson for Zimbabwe told DW It is like a a very finely tuned machine to get the stocks into Zimbabwe on time And we need the maximum level of flexibility from our donors so that we are able to deliver Nevill said on the phone from Harare Putting food on the table The South African nonprofit FoodForward SA is also ramping up its activities to meet the COVID19 challenge as the country went into a lockdown at midnight on Thursday March 26 FoodForward SA recovers edible surplus food from farmers wholesalers and retailers and redistributes it to a network of 670 beneficiary organizations that use the groceries to prepare meals for around 255000 people a day This week the nonprofit organization launched a R50 million 285 million appeal so it can provide more food to groups deemed a higher risk such as the elderly and those with tuberculosis and HIVAIDS during the coronavirus pandemic It also wants to expand its operations from six to nine provinces We have commitments of donations and material support steadily coming in said Managing Director Andy Du Plessis We already have R15 million donated and we have a few million rand worth of food on its way into our warehouses Planning for corona has meant finding extra warehouse capacity nationally to store food as a backup and fast tracking application from potential new beneficiary organizations And while its been tough getting hold of masks hand sanitizers and other equipment that staff working with food need Du Plessis says they are now on their way The food charity expects it will be working flat out for the next few months We anticipate given what we are seeing in other countries that the curve might not flatten within the 21 day lockdown period imposed in South Africa Du Plessis told DW So we are operating with that framework in mind We estimate that things will get worse before they get better because we are far from reaching the peak of the impact Converting school lunches In Kenya the local charity Food4Education normally provides 10000 primary school children with a subsidized lunch Monday through to Friday But with schools closed as of March 16 Food4Education has been working nonstop to convert its lunch project to a food aid program and find extra funding to do this The children in the communities we work with they come from a very vulnerable place said Joan Wanjiru from Food4Education on the phone from Nairobi Not many in these communities can afford to stay at home as ordered by the government because many are casual workers or labors They need to go out to earn their day is fees Of course you can imagine how the stayathome order impacts their daily budget and how kids are able to eat Wanjiru said Food4Education is preparing food baskets for 6000 families whose children are normally part of the lunch program They will be given out next week Each family has around five people per family so we are looking at around 30000 people Wanjiru told DW The food basket will include beans maize rice and maize flour 20 kg of each That will enable the kids to access nutritious meals even though the families budgets have been stretched Investing in local expertise The lockdowns around the world have hit some aid organizations harder than others Medecins Sans Frontieres for example often flies in medical experts specialists and project staff to manage health crises But travel restrictions mean our international staff cant travel to come and support our projects for example in Africa said Yap Boum the regional representative for Epicenter Africa MSF is research arm Also within Africa the borders are closed and we cannot fly from one country to another On the one hand he said on the phone from Cameroon this is an enormous challenge because MSF currently cannot count on help from Europe On the other hand Boum says it is a chance for African experts to fill the gap It is a great

says the classic by Albert Camus It is currently experiencing a renaissance because we feel that the coronavirus also affects us all worldwide There is still no vaccine no cure for anyone The virus does not differentiate between poor rich skin colour or nationality It can affect anyone it does not stop at any border Countries around the world have therefore taken measures that seemed completely unthinkable just a few weeks ago Interpersonal contacts were massively restricted borders closed companies and air traffic largely shut down All this was and is right because there is nothing more important than saving human lives Like every country we have a duty first and foremost to bring the crisis under control at home Only then can we assist others as we do for example by treating seriously ill patients from Italy and France in German hospitals In the long term however we will only be able to defeat the virus if we also get to grips with it in Europe and worldwide If it spreads uncontrolled there sooner or later it will hit us again like a boomerang If entire countries and regions of the world fall into economic or humanitarian abysses we too will not recover in the long term Germany as an export nation in particular needs a healthy Europe and a functioning global economy That is why it is not only an act of European solidarity but pure economic reason that the European Union is launching the largest aid package in its history with over 500 billion euros Our aim is for Europe to emerge from this crisis stronger with more solidarity and more sovereignly than it entered it To this end the EU budget for the next seven years must become a genuine revitalisation programme for Europe So let us rethink it and invest massively in the future now in research climate protection technological sovereignty and crisisproof health and social systems We must set the course for this during our EU Presidency which begins on 1 July this year We will make it a Corona Presidency to overcome corona and its consequences Once we are out of the woods one of the first tasks will be to gradually and in a coordinated way reduce restrictions on free travel and the internal market Lessons must be learned from the crisis for example by improving EU civil protection and the joint procurement and production of essential medical supplies And we must correct the mistakes that this crisis has relentlessly exposed I am thinking above all of the restrictions on democracy and the rule of law under the guise of fighting corona which are unacceptable in Europe Anyone who undermines the European Union is foundation of values should not expect to benefit fully from the Union is financial advantages Internationally too it is becoming increasingly clear that selfishness whether in the competition for protective masks or in the supply of medicines is exacerbating the crisis for everyone In the G7 framework we have therefore agreed to cooperate more closely in the development and distribution of medical goods and to keep supply chains open The framework conditions for this are anything but simple After all keeping your distance is not only important in the private sphere but also in corona diplomacy Travel and direct contact are impossible I hear and see my colleagues all the more often by telephone or video no matter whether it is about the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of German tourists or the lifting of export restrictions on essential medicines The UN Security Council is also currently meeting virtually because it is particularly needed right now Wars and conflicts are the ideal breeding ground for the virus We are working alongside UN SecretaryGeneral Guterres for a global ceasefire and have put the crisis on the Security Council is agenda If we do not take rapid countermeasures the virus will shake up peace and stability worldwide We therefore want to direct the international community is attention to where the health crisis is already threatening to exacerbate security crises We will make this a priority of our Presidency of the Security Council in July One of the best investments in the fight against the pandemic is to strengthen the United Nations especially the underfunded World Health Organization for example in the development and distribution of tests and vaccines We will discuss the how this week when the Alliance for Multilateralism we have formed will also address this issue The causes of the crisis must also be addressed But mutual recriminations are of no help to anyone It is not a question of which system is superior but of winning the battle against the virus together Democracies worldwide have acted quickly and decisively Within a week the Bundestag put together an unprecedented aid package Our welfare state and our health system are showing their strongest side But more importantly millions of people have shown that they are prepared to give up certain freedoms for a certain period of time because the lives and health of their fellow human beings are at risk We need this solidarity to defeat the virus in Germany in Europe and worldwide When I look at the wave of helpfulness that we are currently experiencing in Germany and many other countries most people seem to have understood this That gives hope Millions of people give up their freedoms for a certain period of time because the lives and health of their fellow human beings are at risk The author is Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs and member of the SPDNote This article has been

the Greek island of Lesbos was designed for 3000 refugees but houses 20000 Given the coronavirus evacuating it is paramount says migration expert Gerald Knaus How do you keep social distance in a sprawling totally overstretched refugee facility like Moria that was already a health hazard before the virus made landfall in Greece How do you regularly wash your hands when there is not enough water and soap For most people living in any of the overcrowded camps on the Greek islands following the measures recommended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus simply is not possible Read more Moria refugee camp an ideal breeding ground for a rapid spread of coronavirus DW spoke to migration expert Gerald Knaus who is a cofounder of the think tank the European Stability Initiative Knaus was the architect of the European Union is refugee deal with Turkey signed in March 2016 However he says that that deal is now gone DW The European Union wants to start the relocation of 1600 unaccompanied minors to willing EU member states this week is this a sufficient step Gerald Knaus Under normal conditions it makes sense to focus on the most vulnerable such as unaccompanied minors However these are not normal conditions and the emphasis should be on whatever can help the largest number of vulnerable people There are tens of thousands of vulnerable people on the Greek islands many of them children and all of them should be evacuated Children with parents are no safer than unaccompanied minors The question is how to move 35000 people from the islands to the mainland fast Because of the coronavirus Yes We are facing a still preventable wellannounced and devastating humanitarian crisis on the islands Conditions have been terrible for a long time but if you add that some in these hotspots will at some point catch the virus under conditions in Lesbos where 20000 people cannot separate cannot wash their hands and with only six intensive care beds on the island it is obvious why we must act The coronavirus entered a Dutch submarine recently and everyone was put in social isolation right away What are we waiting for in Lesbos This is not only in the interest of the refugees but of Greece and the European Union as a whole To defeat the virus we need to tackle the weakest links in our health care systems How could such a relocation to the Greek mainland work The very basic first step is that the Greek government tells its European partners that it wants to do this If the Greek government is thinking we will sit this out we will risk it then nobody can help It is clear now that there will be no returns from the islands to Turkey in the coming months The borders are closed This means those who are now on the islands will stay in Greece Many in Greece understand that this is a time bomb it is like repeating a largescale mass event every day I hope any moment now the Greek prime minister will call other prime ministers in Europe and say We must solve this and we need support Then of course others in the EU must be ready and that requires starting a debate on what to do now You are taking part in this debate and you have presented a proposal It is actually clear what needs to be done and what can be done You have to evacuate 35000 refugees as quickly as possible from the islands to the Greek mainland You could quickly have 15000 additional beds in temporary tent camps The International Organization of Migration IOM is capable of building these within a few weeks Another 10000 people can be accommodated in nowvacant Greek hotels Finally 10000 people could easily be accommodated in places already paid for by the EU places where recognized refugees are hosted right now If countries like Germany could take in these recognized refugees quickly they would create space for families from the islands immediately This would also send a strong signal to the Greeks that they are not alone But in European countries strongly affected by the coronavirus politicians might find it very difficult to convince the public to take in refugees right now It is clear only some countries will participate In Germany people are aware that there is space in refugee centers today And if you transfer recognized asylumseekers you know who they are Let is say Germany offers to bring in 5000 of them from the mainland We know their identity We know they deserve protection We are talking about a relatively small number Germany moved 170000 Germans back from abroad in the past week This could be done while ensuring health standards It would be the kind of European solidarity that people would still remember decades from now It is in a moment of crisis where we show that we will defend values like human dignity and the refugee convention that solidarity with European partners will still be defended under pressure What is the status of the EUTurkey refugee deal given the pandemic You were the mastermind behind it four years ago It is gone We had an agreement in 2016 That worked for four years benefitted Syrians in Turkey and brought down numbers of arrivals and deaths sharply It never worked on the islands however and the assistance the EU promised to Turkey was to be allocated for four years This happened and the money was all allocated to projects by the end of 2019 This was the key interest for Turkey from the statement But there was no followup Then at the end of February 2020 Ankara did the opposite of what it had committed to and moved migrants to the Greek land border With this the 2016 statement was history So what now If the EU wants renewed cooperation we need a new mutual engagement a new statement There are talks at this moment between the European Commission and Turkey But these suffer from two basic problems The European Commission is not putting more money on the table This must change but it will only change if EU member states back this strongly And secondly Turkey is not realistic It wants to discuss things now that the EU will not resolve quickly in this crisis Turkey needs to be realistic the EU needs to be realistic Everybody loses without cooperation All

the accommodation facilities Asylum seekers will probably no longer be distributed across the republic or taken to other EU countries Manuel Bewarder The speed with which the corona virus brings even the now actually sophisticated reception and accommodation of asylum seekers to its knees can be observed especially in the asylum accommodation in Suhl Thuringia Only a few days ago a resident there tested positive Only hours later the authorities sealed off the entire area More than 500 people were under quarantine Nobody is allowed in nobody is allowed out What happened in Suhl gives an idea of what is about to happen similarly in other shelters and branches of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees BAMF and in regional shelters The virus is bouncing across the country often unrecognised and of course it does not stop at the thousands who have entered the Federal Republic of Germany each month as asylum seekers Cases have also occurred elsewhere On Tuesday the Federal Ministry of the Interior said that there were 13 confirmed infections at six locations Descriptions of local people sound dramatic In Suhl residents tried to climb over the fences quickly Several people have since been transferred because they had resisted the isolation regulations Elsewhere it is reported employees are confronted with isolating suspicious cases Interpreters are not always present quickly such a situation threatens to escalate Visitors are banned permission to leave the premises is often not granted However playgrounds are still used in part according to the authorities In addition there is the danger of employees becoming ill They are almost always in close contact with the residents As soon as they fail the question arises What then who then According to information from WELT the federal and state governments are negotiating to shut down the asylum system in large parts in view of the current crisis Earlier the BAMF had already announced various changes As of Tuesday afternoon two employees had already tested positive Many others were in quarantine and could no longer be deployed on site The aim is to maintain the asylum system at least rudimentarily The facilities in the country are operating in emergency mode It took some time until the BAMF is Nuremberg headquarters provided guidance at least on the most important concerns of the staff At the beginning of the week various employees with whom WELT had contact felt that the authority had no plan In the course of Monday various measures were finally communicated The Suhl branch office was initially closed until 27 March No more applications are accepted there hearings are suspended The same applies overall to interviews in the socalled revocation procedure in which it is to be examined after a certain period of time whether the reasons for the previously granted protection status still exist ie whether for example the situation in the country of origin has improved Now according to WELT information further steps are in the pipeline They are closely linked to general measures aimed at keeping people at a distance preventing unnecessary travel and breaking chains of infection Humanitarian admission from abroad via socalled resettlement programmes has already been suspended In addition according to WELTInformationen the distribution of newly arriving asylum seekers over the federal territory is to be suspended for the time being this is to be handled consistently throughout the country Actually the socalled Köigsteiner Key regulates that protection seekers are distributed over the federal states in a way that is as comprehensible as possible And after other states have stopped the Dublin transfers to other EU countries for the time being Germany will follow suit However the BAMF wants to prevent a shutdown of the asylum system It wants to ensure that asylum applications can still be made Hearings on the details of a protection application are also to continue albeit under new conditions Now applicants must either prove that they have not contracted the coronavirus or that they have been in a 14day quarantine It should be possible to submit followup applications in writing For many asylum seekers this is accompanied by legal uncertainties After all deadlines are due According to the BAMF a Dublin suspension would also result in an interruption of the deadline In security circles it is hoped that these measures will be sufficient for the time being One is going on sight more is not possible at the moment It is hoped that in the meantime especially in view of the travel restrictions only a few new asylum seekers will be counted In Bremen for example there were only four in one day at the beginning of the week In Suhl protected officials had to move disrupters Note This article has been translated automatically

dealing with the coronavirus outbreak Florian Gehm House on Hood where you still have some guts In January the pub in the New Zealand city of Hamilton published a photo on the Internet which made the 165000 inhabitant city worldfamous on the Internet at least in the short term A photomontage showed a bottle of the Mexican beer brand Corona with a mouthguard and the provocative slogan There are worse things to catch Until now the business with the fear of the lung disease Covid19 better known as coronavirus is still considered an absolute marketing taboo Instead companies try to sell potential problems in the supply chain as being as minor as possible and to give their customers a sense of normality But that is not the best idea says brand expert Arnd Zschiesche WORLD The coronavirus is causing serious supply bottlenecks for more and more companies How should companies deal with this Arnd Zschiesche Proactive and transparent across the entire value chain Companies should present clearly and comprehensibly what the problems caused by the coronavirus are and where exactly they are currently working hard on improvements These are exactly the statements that they should best back up with pictures and text showing that the problem is a matter for the boss on the one hand but of course the entire company is also pulling together to ensure that our customers continue to receive the best possible service Anyone who tries to sweep things under the carpet or play things down in 2020 has not understood digitisation and the fact that transparency is essential for a serious company operating in the long term Many companies do exactly the opposite they propagate normality Why In my view this is a typical procedure as large corporations like to do nonoffensive crisis management However I am convinced that the opposite is the case Companies should not spread panic but should clearly show that they are in a real challenge As far as I know customers have never reacted angrily when a company deals offensively and honestly with a difficult situation that is currently apparent to everyone No longterm damage has yet been caused by authentic communication with customers and the public Instead trust and thus loyalty to the company increases A fact from which brands will also benefit when the corona epidemic is over It is important to demonstrate that one does not want to be a cheap profiteer of the epidemic How should one proceed They should not only talk but above all act concretely For example if I sell products that directly protect people from this epidemic then as an ethical company I must consider it my duty to educate and in the best case even reduce the prices of these products This shows my personal and social commitment The upright businessman and brand strategist always sees such a devastating crisis as his next Porsche It can also be a unique opportunity to show yourself and your company from its best side Do you have an example of this If Sagrotan cuts its prices in half during the crisis and supports hospitals the brand is the moral winner of the corona epidemic also and because the company does not pocket the full profit For more than 100 years the brand has lived on the fact that it is trusted with the highest level of competence in the field of hygiene Now it can also prove to the company in a striking way that the group is leaders are serious about it Besides drugstores pharmacies are the winners of the epidemic Respiratory masks for example are in short supply Would not it be obvious to do business with fear by putting anticorona products directly in the shop window That is obvious but it can be done much better The tone and feel for detail make all the difference Pharmacies and drugstores can rely on their own expertise and can provide medical or scientific backup but at the same time be socially and closely related This can mean advising against certain products or pointing out personal advice setting up a certain table with products that can be recommended to the best of one is knowledge and in the best case reducing prices for important products They all have to communicate with customers at eye level they should take fears seriously without firing them up And how can German companies that produce in China behave Their businesses often stand still Any German company doing business in the People is Republic could use this time to place its brand there with sensible donations in kind of course preferably from its own portfolio For example when the dishwasher manufacturer Meiko supplies dishwashers for two emergency hospitals and guarantees that the dishes are virusfree after washing this is a helpful measure but also excellent branding Which brands will be the biggest winners of the epidemic All brands that have a direct connection to this crisis through their products or services and manage to present in a responsible manner how the company deals with it and what measures are taken to protect customers and employees Paired with real commitment through visible engagement against the disease which clearly goes beyond profit thinking In a business world in which thankfully humanitarian disasters do not happen every day crises always offer a chance to prove oneself But here too deliberately naively formulated it should come from the heart and authentically fit the company Note This article has been translated automatically

cardboard and plastic bottles extend as far as the eye can see A young child maybe six years old wades through the garbage Here in the socalled jungle where makeshift huts crush up against one another and children play in the filth the squalor of the Moria refugee camp is on full display This hot spot located on the Greek island of Lesbos has been the scene of Europe is largest humanitarian crisis for years now A camp originally designed to temporarily shelter 3000 people it is now the cramped home of more than 20000 The situation is not much better on other islands in the Aegean In all some 42000 refugees and migrants are currently stuck on Lesbos Chios and Samos and many have been there for more than a year Now the coronavirus pandemic threatens to make the situation even worse A migrant from the Moria camp sews handmade protective masks at an NGO on the island of Lesbos Just recently Germany and a number of EU member states including France and Luxembourg declared their willingness to take in those in most desperate need of help Vulnerable unaccompanied minors and children The European Commission estimates that 1500 unaccompanied children and minors are currently on the Greek isles Last Friday EU interior ministers pledged they would be distributed among a coalition of willing EU member states within a week Read more MSF Moria refugee camp an ideal breeding ground for a rapid spread of coronavirus Water cannon tear gas and smoke bombs But that willingness is not only humanitarian in nature it is also pragmatic The EU was forced into action when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan decided to open his country is borders with Greece two weeks ago sending thousands of refugees rushing toward Europe Greek security forces overwhelmed by the sheer number of refugees demanding entry into Europe answered with water cannon tear gas and smoke bombs It was reported that at least two people were killed by Greek bullets something the government in Athens denies Images of standoffs were quickly broadcast around the world putting the EU under pressure to do something about the situation But the new COVID19 coronavirus pandemic has changed everything with EU member states enhancing border controls or closing borders altogether in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus That was also the reason the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration IOM gave for the temporary suspension of activities at their Refugee Resettlement Program Thus for the moment no safe haven can be found for those refugees in especially dire straits that includes safe haven in Germany Read more Opinion In Greece refugees are painted as the enemy Asselborn It is not up to us The program for taking in unaccompanied children was not supposed to be affected by the situation at least according to European Commission spokesperson Adalbert Jahnz He claimed albeit in vague terms that the process would go on as planned but suggested that respecting and navigating the many different steps EU member states had taken to stop the spread of the virus was taking up a lot of time and making it impossible to set out a clear timeline for the transfer of children from Greece Jahnz went on to say However I assure you that intense discussions are going on as we speak and preparations are currently underway Another spokesperson for the Commission which has agreed to play a coordinating role in the project told DW the COVID19 pandemic will likely have an effect on the process Germany is Interior Ministry was vague as well saying only that the European Commission is currently assessing what level of coordination is possible right now in light of the situation On Wednesday a statement was released saying the COVID19 pandemic would not have any effect on our efforts Still speaking with DW on Thursday Luxembourg is Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn conceded that his country would not be taking in refugee children for now It is not up to us to Greece or the UNHCR In terms of security and health it is simply impossible to guarantee humane conditions for taking in people during these difficult times said Asselborn He said Luxembourg and other EU member states would do all they could in the meantime to prepare for the children to be transferred as soon as possible Boris Cheshirkov a spokesperson for UNHCR Greece understands that coronavirus will slow the process but urged the EU to push on with preparations regardless so that they can start transferring children as soon as the time comes Read more Germany stops accepting refugees over coronavirus Refugee camps under quarantine Many aid organizations have warned that catastrophic sanitary conditions at refugee camps make it imperative to get people there to safer lodgings where they can better protect themselves from illness In Germany celebrities and politicians started online petitions to do just that under the names WirHabenPlatz We Have Space and LeaveNoOneBehind so far 80000 people have signed the appeals Those behind the campaigns point to the miserable living conditions at the camps something DW journalists have frequently documented pointing to the fact that hundreds of refugees at Moria for instance are forced to share just one toilet It is also almost impossible to bathe at the camps and even the most basic hygienic precautions such as washing one is hands cannot be taken ulliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Contaminated door handles Current research says the coronavirus family of viruses can survive on some surfaces like door handles for an average of four to five days Like all droplet infections SARSCoV2 can spread via hands and frequently touched surfaces Although it has not previously been seen in humans and therefore has not been studied in detail experts believe it spreads similarly to other known coronaviruses liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Not so delicious A certain degree of caution is called for when eating lunch at your work cafeteria or in a cafe that is if they have not been closed yet Technically coronaviruses can contaminate cutlery or crockery if they are coughed on by an infected person But the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment BfR states that no infections with SARSCoV2 via this transmission route are known to date liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Viruscarrying teddy bears Should parents be afraid of a possible infection from imported toys It is unlikely say the BfR As of yet there are no cases of an infection via imported toys or other goods Experts have so far assumed that the viruses have a relatively low environmental stability but research does show that the pathogens can remain infectious for several days especially in high humidity and cold settings liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Packages letters and shipped goods A recent study from the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in the US found the novel coronavirus can survive up to 72 hours on stainless steel and up to 24 hours on plastic and cardboard surfaces in an ideal laboratory setting But because the survival of the virus is dependent on many factors like temperature and humidity the BfR says getting infected from handling the post is rather unlikely liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Can my dog infect me or can I infect my dog Experts consider the risk of pets being infected with the coronavirus to be very low But they cannot yet rule it out The animals themselves show no symptoms so they do not become ill However if they are infected it is possible they could transmit coronaviruses via the air or via excretions their poop liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Fruit and vegetables suddenly dangerous Unlikely According to the BfR transmitting SARSCoV2 via contaminated food is not likely to happen and so far there are no proven cases of infection this way As the viruses are heatsensitive heating food during cooking can further reduce the risk of infection Of course you should thoroughly wash your hands before cooking and eating and this goes for anytime regardless of corona liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak Contaminated frozen food Although the SARS and MERS coronaviruses known to date do not like heat they are quite immune to the cold Research shows they can remain infectious at minus 20 degrees Celsius for up to two years But the BfR gives frozen food the allclear So far there is no evidence of SARSCoV2 infection via the consumption of any food including frozen food liliHands off What can we touch during the coronavirus outbreak But leave those wild animals alone The COVID19 outbreak has prompted many extraordinary measures and China is ban of the consumption of wild animals is no exception There is compelling research to suggest the novel coronavirus originated in bats before being passed to humans via another intermediate animal But it is not the animals we need to blame experts say humans are exposed to these viruses via our interaction with animals Author Julia Vergin cs liul They also note that there is a severe shortage of doctors at the camps to help with those who may become infected There is simply no way for the more than 20000 people crammed into the bursting facility to isolate themselves to avoid contracting the virus Hoping to stop an explosion of infections the Greek government has put its camps under quarantine Residents are only allowed to leave the camps during the day and then only in small numbers It remains to be seen if that will be enough though EU Commissioner for Home

valuedadded tax VAT and stop monthly payments to citizens Record low oil prices and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic are taking their toll Saudi Arabia has decided to cut its cost of living allowance from June and to hike VAT from 5 to 15 from July 1 As record low oil prices and the effects of the coronavirus crisis take their toll Finance Minister Mohammed alJadaan said in a statement on Monday that the measures were necessary to shore up state finances amid a sharp decline in oil revenue as the coronavirus scare reduces global demand for crude and cuts growth forecasts The IMF projected the Saudi economy would fall 23 this year So far the minister of finance announced that the citizen account that benefits lower income Saudis will not be affected Yasmine Farouk visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said The increase in VAT will however affect the standard of living of all Saudis but those who will feel it the most would be the poorer of course Both development and humanitarian aid will continue to be a central tool in Saudi foreign policy especially in the absence of alternative tools that give Saudi Arabia as much of an influence and edge over other competing powers Yemen is a place where Saudi humanitarian and development aid will definitely continue Farouk added The kingdom first introduced VAT two years ago to help reduce reliance on world crude oil markets The allowance of 1000 riyals 267 240 a month to state employees who make up twothirds of total employment in the oilrich kingdom was also introduced in 2018 to offset increased financial burdens on poorer Saudis The government was also canceling extending or postponing expenditure for some government agencies and cutting spending on projects introduced as part of the Vision 2030 reform program aimed at diversifying the oilreliant economy the minister said Deficits bite State media said the fiscal moves would raise state revenues by 100 billion riyals The kingdom reported a 9 billion budget deficit in the first three months of the year as oil revenues in the period fell by almost a quarter from a year earlier to 34 billion bringing down total revenues by 22 The Saudi Jadwa Investment group predicts the budget deficit will hit a record 112 billion this year Jadaan said the country would have to borrow 60 billion this year to plug the budget deficit Jadaan said he expected Riyadh could lose half of its oil income which contributes about 70 of public revenues as oil prices have fallen twothirds since the start of the year By comparison Russia the secondlargest world exporter of oil attributes 40 of its revenue to oil Backlash Riyads austerity policy is seen exacerbating public anger amid an already high cost of living and scrutiny of multibilliondollar state projects Also under the spotlight is a proposed 300 million pound 372 million Saudibacked takeover of the Newcastle United football club in England It is unclear if the NEOM project a 500billion megacity set to be built along the kingdom is western coast will be impacted Saudi citizens are starting to feel the economic impact of the virus in a concrete way Middle East expert Yasmine Farouk from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told the French news agency AFP With hardship will come more scrutiny of state spending elsewhere including the purchase of a football team and millions spent on entertainment events Transitioning to a more private sectororiented economy could not have come at a worse time for the Saudi lower and middle class according to Garbis Iradian chief economist for the Middle East and North Africa at the Institute of International Finance IIF noting that Vision 2030 sought to decrease unemployment to 7 but that it will likely rise to 13 in 2020 Although the government rarely releases statistics it is estimated that around 20 of the 34 million Saudi population live in poverty According to a 2017 UN report the antipoverty measures taken by the government were inefficient unsustainable poorly coordinated and above all unsuccessful in providing comprehensive social protection to those most in need No turning back The combination of recordlow oil prices and mounting demographic pressures poses significant challenges to Prince Mohammed is MBS future plans in Saudi Arabia according to The Soufan Center think tank The hightech city in NEOM is the crown jewel of MBS future vision for Saudi Arabia but it remains unclear how a prince is pet project will help the kingdom deal with its youth bulge The government will have less cash to dispense as patronage to assuage Saudi citizens The erosion of the social contract between the rulers and the ruled will lead to serious problems especially in a tribal society The economic fundamentals have turned further against this fantastical project but I do not expect MBS to give it up said Kristin Diwan of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington It is the touchstone for everything he wants to achieve If not handled carefully the new developments could really amplify already noticeable inequalities between wealthy young city dwellers and just about everyone else said Diwan But while many are discontented with the new direction in the country Saudi Arabia doesnt have an organized opposition movement inside of the country The Saudi leadership knows it needs to focus more on internal affairs Diwan goes on Theyve already cut off Lebanon and are looking for a way out of the Yemen conflict Still I dont expect the Kingdom to withdraw completely from the contest for regional influence The new nationalist leadership is always looking to exert Saudi interests and elevate its prestige Diwan added 53391229

of deaths is quite stable in these times we can with necessary caution attribute a large portion of these deaths during these past two months to the epidemic the INPS said The institute also mentioned that it was possible that the spike in deaths was not just because of the virus but also because many people suffering from other illnesses could not get the right healthcare as the systems were

why not distribute patients throughout Europe It is a question of life and death Marc Pfitzenmaier The coronavirus continues to spread and in the EU countries such as Italy France and Germany are particularly hard hit by the pandemic Calls for European solidarity have been many at the first EU video summit two weeks ago We underlined the need for a common European approach and close coordination with the European Commission the final document said at the time Eurogroup finance ministers on Tuesday spoke of a new line of defence against the economic consequences of the pandemic But European solidarity has so far been more economic than humanitarian There is rather symbolic politics German clinics had admitted intensive care patients from the neighbouring states France and Italy in the last few days they were divided between several clinics in BadenWüttemberg and Leipzig Some Italian patients were also flown to Germany In both cases the number of patients is very small But why should it not be possible to create a common European contingent for intensive care beds on a large scale Could not those countries that are not so badly affected by the crisis at the moment open their intensive care rooms to patients from those countries that are overburdened After all intensive care unit places are the rarest and highest good of the corona crisis whoever gets one has a good chance of survival despite severe symptoms Many seriously ill patients for whom there is no such place have to die a situation that has already occurred in Italy and now also in Spain The calls for a European solution for the distribution of the most seriously ill are therefore becoming louder This is what Peter Liese CDU health policy spokesman of the conservative EPP group in the European Parliament demands of WELT The EU Commission should play a more coordinating role in the distribution of patients with severe symptoms on intensive care beds Katarina Barley SPD VicePresident of the European Parliament has a similar view The EU Commission started coordinating measures in the crisis much too late she said Although it has now started to organise the procurement and distribution of medical supplies Barley said But it is also conceivable that she might organise the workload of hospitals This is currently a matter for the Member States to decide amongst themselves But is this realistic First of all The EU countries collect their data on intensive care beds in very different ways so it is difficult to get an overview of the capacities and occupancy rates of individual countries But the analysis of government statements press reports and scientific surveys suggests that at the moment some countries still have capacities while other EU countries are in urgent need of help The situation is particularly dramatic in Italy where at least 6800 people have died as a result of the corona virus and about 3400 people are currently being treated in an intensive care unit According to the latest official figures from the Ministry of Health the maximum number of intensive care places has thus almost been reached two years ago a total of 5090 beds was stated and many of the beds will of course still be needed for noncorona patients In any case the capacities of individual cities and regions which were particularly badly affected have long since been exceeded In Lombardy alone almost 1200 patients are in intensive care according to reports hospitals there already have to turn away many intensive care cases or send them to other regions In Spain too not all hospitals are at their capacity limits but some regions are overburdened Nationwide there are said to be 4627 intensive care beds but in the capital Madrid alone the number of intensive care patients exceeded 1000 on Monday The government is now setting up additional places for the intensive care of corona patients in clinics but also exhibition halls and hotels under high pressure There are almost 13000 intensive care beds in French hospitals Of these about 10000 are probably blocked by noncorona patients Of the remaining 3000 beds 2000 are already occupied by corona patients The supply situation is currently better in Poland for example where 10167 intensive care beds are available In addition Poland has so far taken very rigorous measures to keep the epidemic well under control and has only infected a small number of patients All countries are currently making efforts to increase their capacities For example new places are being created in public and private hospitals or other areas are being converted nonessential operations are being postponed or respiratory equipment is being collected where most serious cases are treated But what is the situation in Germany Figures are not easy to find A recent report by the Science Media Center and the Technical University of Berlin mentions a total number of intensive care beds in Germany of around 28000 but when it comes to the question of capacities it is important to note that there is a high demand for such places even apart from Corona According to the report 79 percent of intensive care beds were occupied in 2017 leaving 5586 beds empty According to the latest information from the German Hospital Federation DKG around 1000 intensive care beds are currently occupied by corona patients and a further 4000 infected persons with less serious disease progression are distributed among hospitals throughout Germany If this ratio of available intensive care beds to case numbers were assumed several thousand places would currently be available But in view of the current number of 30000 corona patients and a further increasing infection curve can it not be assumed that intensive care beds will soon be increasingly needed by German patients The distribution of seriously ill patients is currently still quite possible in view of the available capacities says Reinhard Busse Professor of Management in the Healthcare Sector who played a major role in the Science Media Center report The researcher kept a low profile on the question of how the situation will develop in the coming weeks As far as the concrete planning of such transports is concerned certain basic things must be taken into account the expert said One has to consider when the transport of seriously ill patients makes sense logistically at all he said adding that this was the case when for example corona patients were transported from Alsace to Freiburg or to nearby institutions as was the case earlier this week Retrofitting a jumbo jet and flying in hundreds of patients from far away regions would however be a considerable effort and therefore difficult to imagine on a large scale the expert says The regional solution whether national or across a nearby national border is therefore in principle more appropriate The plans for the videoconference of the heads of state and government on Thursday indicate that the member states only want to take hesitant steps in this direction This is shown by the previously formulated decisions of the summit which are available to WELT Accordingly the summit participants will probably call on the Member States to provide the Commission with timely and reliable data on medical equipment so that the Commission can ensure adequate supplies throughout Europe However it is unlikely that the question of distribution which is vital to the survival of many sick Europeans will be answered Tiemo Wöken the health policy spokesman of the European SPD is also not very confident at this point that the intensive care bed question will be solved in solidarity We saw this when the EU tried to distribute fire fighting equipment in Europe after the last forest fire season he told WELT Member States at that time fought tooth and nail against making capacity mandatory A seriously ill Covid19 patient from Bergamo Italy is admitted to the Helios Clinic in Leipzig

have brought the coronavirus back home with them from their travels Many of them also employ domestic workers from the country is favelas who they are apparently unwilling to protect by telling them to stay home Brazil is poorest class could make easy quarry for the disease For our Global Societies project reporters around the world will be writing about societal problems sustainability and development in Asia Africa Latin America and Europe The series will include features analyses photo essays videos and podcasts looking behind the curtain of globalization The project is generously funded by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation For 63 years Cleonice Gonçalves a maid and domestic worker led a life that went unnoticed by anyone in Rio de Janeiro Gonçalves worked in a chic apartment in Leblon down near the beach where property values are higher than anywhere else in Brazil She cleaned toilets and door handles cooked and ironed Four days a week she slept in the tiny servant is quarters in an apartment that belonged to her patroa her boss On weekends she drove home to Miguel Pereira two hours away where she lived with her family in an unplastered house beside a gravel road Gonçalves who spent her life being invisible in a faceless sea of cheap labor commuting from the slums to the city in overcrowded buses and trains did not register on Brazilian society is radar until she died recently Her death terrified the country Gonçalves boss the media reported had traveled to Italy for Carnival After returning home the elderly woman had herself tested for the coronavirus though she did not think it necessary to inform Gonçalves of this fact or to withhold her services while she waited for her test results Things continued as normal until Gonçalves sought medical attention on March 13 because of pain during urination The doctor prescribed her an antibiotic Two days later she started having trouble breathing Gonçalvez who was a diabetic and suffered from high blood pressure went to a hospital but again no one recognized her symptoms Gonçalves died on March 17 the same day her patroa received her positive test result The fact that a woman like Gonçalves became in all likelihood Rio de Janeiro is first coronavirus victim was more than just symbolic It was a harbinger A Virus Carried in by Elites Like in many other countries in the southern hemisphere the coronavirus was brought to Brazil by a wealthy predominantly white middle and upper class people who have the means to travel It is no coincidence that Rio de Janeiro is first coronavirus cases were reported in the wealthy urban areas of Leblon and Ipanema But there is an even bigger concern What will happen if the virus first begins to spread in the poorer neighborhoods where the people live who keep city life going domestic workers like Gonçalves the cooks and nannies doormen supermarket cashiers bartenders and waiters and all the merchants who sell their wares on the sidewalks The daily newspaper O Globo articulated this fear a few days ago in a massive frontpage photo that required no further explanation It showed a section of the favela Rocinha a boundless tangle of houses and huts all nestled on top of one another It is a place where tens of thousands of people live together in an extremely confined space Not only did the image seem to carry an apocalyptic message for what was to come it could have also been interpreted as a call for help aimed at Brazil is president Jair Bolsonaro who was initially adamant in his dismissals of the virus as a minor flu Brazil cannot be compared to Italy the president said not long ago Italy has 200 inhabitants per square kilometer who are overwhelmingly old In Brazil there are 24 people per square kilometer and they are predominantly young But this is statistical nonsense and it has left a growing number of Brazilians shaking their heads According to official figures there are almost 50000 people crowded into a single square kilometer in a place like Rocinha In the Complexo de Maré there are 31000 In the Complexo do Alemao there are 23000 A total of 17 million people live in the nearly 1000 favelas of Rio de Janeiro and conditions there are often extremely precarious The state has withdrawn from many of these settlements allowing them to be taken over by militias or drug gangs Uncollected garbage piles up on many street corners Sewage flows out in the open In homes where six or seven people share a single room social distancing is illusory These days as life in Rio de Janeiro reluctantly slows to a halt the coronavirus is spreading in places like this There are confirmed cases in numerous favelas and dozens more suspected cases This is one of the reasons why Bolsonaro is minister of health Luis Henrique Mandetta has now said that the country is health care system will probably collapse by the end of April If nothing is done a tsunami will hit the public hospitals says Raull Santiago a young man who lives with his wife and four children in a small house in Complexo do Alemao He believes the real problem lies in Brazil is social inequality As a poor person he is at risk All it takes is one look at what is going on with the water Santiago says The water does in fact seem to be jinxed this year In January in Rio all that came out of people is faucets was a brown foulsmelling soup because no one noticed that an algae had contaminated the municipal wastewater treatment facility In February it rained so heavily that there were mudslides in some favelas Entire houses were dragged down the steep hillsides burying their inhabitants underneath Santiago says the tap water is reasonably clean again but several days a week nothing comes out of the faucet at all for some reason This makes it impossible for people to follow the first rule of virus prevention wash your hands regularly Hand sanitizer gel which has been part of everyday life for many Brazilians since the swine flu in 2009 is now so hard to find that even a small bottle costs a fortune Up here on our hill three euros sometimes four or five Santiago says A few years ago Santiago founded an artists collective with a few friends They called it Papo Reto or straight talk During the collective is events he would normally talk about topics like violence or racism These days though he is having posters printed that he and the others will hang in strategic places in the favela like the entrances or where the taxis and buses are which many people still rely on to get to work in the city They suggest for instance that people who still have water should collect it in buckets and share it with their neighbors Several times a day Santiago and his friends drive around the favela with a loudspeaker and remind residents to avoid large crowds and ventilate their homes thoroughly He says they are taking action because the government is not doing enough How Will They Eat No one knows exactly how many Brazilians work in precarious conditions Or how many are losing their jobs these days The question is Who is looking after these people What will happen to the neediest people who have no savings and who are not protected by any social safety net How will they eat In order to prevent a humanitarian emergency the national favela association CUFA published a catalog of 14 demands One of them was that residents of the slums be provided with free soap for the duration of the crisis Internet access should also be free they argued so that people could keep informed Support is also needed for the owners of small shops And those who have been hardest hit should be receiving regular food packages CUFA Chairman Zezé Preto expects their demands to fall on deaf ears within the government They are not interested in people like us he says Paulo Guedes Bolsonaro is neoliberal economy minister said recently that the poorest of the poor could be given 200 Brazilian real 3489 euros a month but no one has heard anything about this proposal since Bolsonaro himself tends to concern himself with other things In his eyes panic over the coronavirus will only lead to an unnecessary slump in Brazil is economic growth That is why he is now demanding that governors reopen businesses in their states Traffic should return to normal and schools should be reopened since children and young people are not at great risk of suffering from COVID19 A man like the renowned infectologist Edimilson Migowski has a hard time remaining calm when he hears such statements The virus is spreading faster than many experts expected he says adding that if the government does not act it will be too late It is important to keep an eye on poor populations especially Migowski says Due to the circumstances of their lives a disproportionate number of them suffer from preexisting conditions A lack of proper hygiene and dark poorly ventilated rooms mean that the proportion of people suffering from tuberculosis or asthma is five times higher in the favelas than in more affluent districts There are also many diabetics due to poor nutrition If you want to protect these people Migowski says then you have to try and isolate them somehow even if it is in empty hotels In order to prevent them from spreading the virus they must be tested as early as possible And not only the severe cases but also the mild ones because they are no less contagious Over the weekend it was revealed that the city was renting hotels to isolate the elderly from the favelas Where Poor People Go for Medical Attention But Brazil still does not have enough tests And hospitals do not have enough protective masks and gloves In Rio cuts in the billions to the public health care system have resulted in the loss of 1051 intensive care beds at the city is hospitals in the past two years alone Personnel at hundreds of family clinics which offer free initial consultations has been thinned out to such an extent since the economic crisis that began in 2014 that they can now only reach half the population Some of the clinics are kept open by unskilled workers because so many doctors have quit their jobs after not receiving their salaries for so long These are the places where people like Cleonice Gonçalves go when they are feeling sick They were overwhelmed even before the coronavirus hit Today tents have been hastily erected in front of many of these clinics in order to separate coronavirus patients from others Soldiers have also set up several field hospitals around the city but Raull Santiago the activist from the Complexo do Alemao is still preparing for the worst Our best case scenario would be to have a situation like Italy he says Recently a nighttime curfew went into effect in some of the city is favelas Over loudspeakers and WhatsApp the drug gangs made an announcement We want only the best for our people If the government is incapable of providing security organized crime will This piece is part of the
