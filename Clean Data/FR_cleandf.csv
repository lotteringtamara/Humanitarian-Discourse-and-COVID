the bad apples who have attempted to divide our people and to weaken our systems will be flushed out We will overcome attempts at destabilisation of our society by a few rogue Zimbabweans acting in league with foreign detractors the president continued The same day activist group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said it was representing at least 20 people arrested since the government thwarted protests planned for the previous Friday including Fadzayi Mahere spokesperson for the main opposition party Movement for Democratic Change and Booker Prizelonglisted novelist Tsitsi Dangarembga who

Dangarembga who is currently on bail told Reuters on Tuesday that it is like the people of Zimbabwe are in a chokehold On Monday the hashtag ZimbabweanLivesMatter trended on Twitter across the globe

citing Covid19 as the reason for the lockdown The Zimbabwean government has used the Covid19 pandemic as a pretext to strengthen its grip on power and curtail the freedom of expression of the opposition and civil society movements Virginie Roiron a Zimbabwe specialist at Sciences Po Strasbourg University told FRANCE 24 The demonstrations were intended to decry corruption and mismanagement of the country is imploding economy as well as marking two years since the disputed election that cemented Mnangagwa is grip on power Ahead of the suppressed protests Ngarivhume was arrested with inciting violence on July 20 along with Hopewell Chinono a prominent journalist and documentary filmmaker who in June helped uncover the Covidgate scandal in which the health minister was sacked and arrested for over alleged corruption in a 60 million deal to procure supplies for the fight against the coronavirus A further financial scandal was uncovered in early July when it was revealed that

recurrent health workers strikes over low pay and a lack of equipment public hospitals are in such a poor condition that unborn children and mothers are dying daily the Zimbabwe Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists told Reuters In the time of Covid the steady meltdown in health services has now become not just a bad dream but a nightmare and stands in stark contrast to the wealth

highest in the world behind Venezuela while the UN is World Food Programme projects that 60 percent of Zimbabweans will suffer from food insecurity by the end of the year Mnangagwa introduced a reform package with IMF support in May 2019 including a new currency seeking to turn a new page after economic crises racked Zimbabwe during the last two decades under Mugabe But in March 2020 by which point the new Zimbabwean dollar had lost most of its value the IMF declared that the country was facing an economic and humanitarian crisis and that Mnangagwa is programme was offtrack because of missteps in its implementation The worsening repression is linked to the macroeconomic instability the country is going through said Marisa Lourenço a southern Africa analyst at consultancy firm Control Risks The government keeps changing its monetary policy which is not good for the economy as it does not address the high inflation rate and limited currency reserves she told FRANCE 24 There is a shortage

Makerere University in Uganda began collecting data this January for a longplanned health vulnerability assessment to identify what makes people and communities more vulnerable or resilient to infectious diseases This study was in place well before the Covid19 pandemic as part of SonarGlobal 1 a European Commissionfunded research programme and the team could amend questions based on current developments The data is now being analysed But it is clear that since lockdowns are still in place globally for fieldworkers and there is a hold on almost all facetoface public health research Uganda may have the only systematic realtime data on how people in atrisk communities conceptualise and respond to the virus The information the assessments collected is notable The interviews lasted between one and three hours much longer than a normal health survey Instead of taking blood samples and asking multiple choice questions researchers met participants in their homes and had structured but wideranging conversations about access to services about availability of medical care and other healthrelated information and about local conventions practices and norms culture Organised humanitarian action all but stops in Covid19 as we have little way of knowing what is happening among those most vulnerable Why culture And why invest time and effort on things apparently unconnected with health and infectious disease Because infectious viruses are about social networks and cultural norms as much as about microbes As science tells us viruses are inert unable to attack us We transmit viral data though our social networks and cultural pathways We give viral information to each other by how we live and what we do Otherwise viruses just sit inert sometimes for thousands of years So understanding cultural contexts is just as important as sequencing genomes in tackling viral outbreaks Culture is nonetheless downgraded Most of the time when medical researchers try to work culture into their models they fall back on tired stereotypes about local beliefs as obstacles to biomedical care a supposed opposition of culture and science In this paradigm social scientists are lined up to help real scientists determine why culture keeps others from doing whats medically recommended A broader understanding of culture recognises its varied potential Though clinicians may see culture as an obstacle to health it is also a source of enduring trust Moreover it is not just something they have healthcare providers scientists and policymakers all have their own cultures of practice which inform their unique perspectives and encourage them to work together Cultures of practice However the underlying and often takenforgranted assumptions of culture about what is feasible can also limit innovative thinking Thats why we use the word culture pejoratively to describe the intransigence of institutional cultures political academic or professional In this sense accounting for the cultural contexts of health and wellbeing is a primary health determinant why the systematic neglect of culture in health and healthcare is the single biggest barrier to the advancement of the highest standard of health worldwide 2 Thats because culture is in fact the key to addressing health equity especially when providers and target populations operate under different shared understandings about what matters most biologically and socially Thus a cultural context of health approach is critical in responding to Covid19 Because governments not previously concerned about health equity feel they must blame others for the impact of their own negligence Because thinking of Covid19 as only a medical challenge fuels xenophobic fears about outsiders Because humanitarian action groups talk about working with communities even as inequalities within communities are exacerbated by the crisis And because given the socially sanctioned chronic neglect of citizens already on the margins Covid19 pushes those on the edge into overt calamity coping The takenforgranted assumptions of cultures of practice give us a sense of belonging and trust but sometimes blunt creative thinking and social innovation For our assumptions help little in times of uncertainty We know this because when a disaster happens so many show up late and with outdated equipment What can a cultural understanding of Covid19 vulnerability tell us We dont need more research to recognise that the elderly the homeless and unemployed single parents are especially at risk Theyre already vulnerable socially and economically and to our shame become even more so when their fragile survival strategies are even more challenged But inequalities are always exaggerated in a crisis and then many initially less vulnerable people are also pushed across capability and opportunity thresholds and into conditions of real peril We need an extant interest in the disadvantaged Ongoing empathy is critical Without that you have no access to what you should have known and now cannot Your belated concern rings hollow in the face of that failure That is why Uganda can now tell us more than we might expect To understand what is happening in real time with real people we need as did David Mafigiri to assess vulnerability before a disaster like his own research team in Uganda we need an extant interest in the disadvantaged Ongoing empathy is critical Without that you have no access to what you should have known and now cant Your belated concern rings hollow in the face of that failure which makes you liable to blame others Indeed organised humanitarian action all but stops in Covid19 as we have little way of knowing whats really happening on the ground among those most vulnerable who live alone and without access to online services In response to such new instability the World Health Organisation WHO rightly wants a Just Recovery from Covid19 That of course is critical But what we need equally is a just preparedness before an epidemic We have to do the hard work of creating cultures of trust and solidarity in advance and resist salvation narratives in which epic actions create savetheworld medical heroes and destructive villainous viruses In welfare states where trust in government has remained relatively stable there are few heroic stories because stability and a commitment to the common weal lessened the need for bombast well before Covid19 incited it Initiatives such as Cities Changing Diabetes a Danish community engagement strategy sponsored by Novo Nordisk 3 demonstrate how prior work around understanding health vulnerabilities translates despite its focus on a noncommunicable disease into actionable understanding in the crisis That is because the programme has been assessing global health vulnerabilities since 2015 years before Covid19 New vulnerabilities Vulnerability emerges variably at different times and places This means that while already vulnerable populations become even more so under stress new vulnerabilities emerge that often outstrip old ones Service industry employees without health benefits and dependent on daily income become more vulnerable especially where they now have to go back to work than those elderly who can stay at home and wait it out Highincome physicians without adequate protective gear are as vulnerable as those with chronic preexisting conditions Places we previously thought of as havens are anything but in Europe and the US the most vulnerable are in care institutions nursing homes shared housing prisons We failed these vulnerable groups because their illness experiences are socially driven and that is too often separated from health We look instead for specific risk factors in isolation without seeing how compounding alreadyexisting stressors push populations into extreme vulnerability during a crisis especially those with few choices and nowhere to go In the UK ethnic minorities are dying at higher rates from the virus than the rest of the population and in the US African Americans have far higher mortality rates than white and Asian American populations 4 Yet as crises widen existing rifts in societies they also open up opportunities for communities to come together in ways unthinkable in normal times in Rio de Janeiro for instance gangs in several favelas imposed shelterinplace orders to reduce transmissions Communities must often adapt on their own because political systems are vulnerable to pandemics too the global crisis is making clearer what is important at national and local levels and what is less so It shows us what we collectively value and makes us reconsider oftentacit assumptions Indeed our judgments of what is essential have also changed across the globe providing a singular opportunity for institutions and governments to rebalance private gain and public good This adjustment can go either way On the one hand speaking of the virus as a foreign enemy incites xenophobia with the social category of insider the we in we are all in this together getting smaller and smaller On the other the pandemic has catalysed new alliances as with Black Lives Matter and antipolice protests Mistrust in the institutions of government may be the only thing uniting the far right and far left in countries like the US and Brazil That is why just preparedness matters and also why Uganda might lead the way in understanding the human impact of Covid19 Because this pandemic is not just about an infectious threat but about the urgency of caring beforehand and about the steep decline in social trust that emerges quickly in unequal settings where global neoliberal economics have undermined public wellbeing Fortunately that decline has created opportunities in surprising places Gangs in favelas may seem a stretch when policymakers think about health systems change but some farsighted private companies have been quicker than many governments to recognise and respond to shifting public sentiment sending their employees to work from home speaking out against racism and calling for more government guidance However not all businesses are equal companies less vulnerable to shareholder pressure to maximise shortterm profits are better able to consider their potential longterm future roles and not just in the next quarter recognising that an economy cannot survive unless nation states and their citizens have stability enough income and access to robust and wellfunded care Mistrust in business There have been calls by world leaders including Ursula von der Leyen head of the European Commission for a new Marshall Plan to improve abysmal levels of trust in business recorded by Richard Edelmans Trust Barometer 5 But that mistrust can only be reversed by sustained longterm commitments that are faithful to a range of stakeholders including employees clients and the social and natural environments we all depend upon for survival Divisive political leaders like Donald Trump or Brazils Jair Bolsonaro may blame the left or the Chinese or the CIA for Covid19 based on alternative often paranoid political narratives that divide local communities That is because for opportunists big or small the crisis remains an intractable intrusion into populist narrative worlds built on political delusion But the viruss deadly materiality resists rhetorical defences and counterfactual denials even if some seem intent on taking the ship down or watching it sink while drowning in denial The states lacking welfare can only blame others Social trust and faith in institutions are therefore crucial for the collective actions required to halt viral transmission We have to coordinate our social behaviours in uncomfortable inconvenient and even personally painful ways They are vital to collective wellbeing and require sacrifice a sense of commonality and social solidarity must be based around shared values culture A crisis in governance correlates with and can be directly mapped onto a crisis in trust because where we find trust is key As the US pulls support from the WHO there is a serious question where do we go for an independent and trustworthy adjudication on health risk The worlds biggest healthcare charity the Gates Foundation has always espoused magic bullet answers to health problems and is uninterested in the complex social drivers of our wellbeing The Centers for Disease Control is a US federal agency that works well in good times but in bad times is vulnerable to partisan political nonsense Without socially trustworthy institutions how are we to respond to growing uncertainty Sustained uncertainty And how finally can we learn to deal with sustained uncertainty and the psychological vulnerability it causes If many governments cannot lead equitably and viruses are just information we share there must be other drivers of Covid19 we can act on Other factors remain underrepresented the more people there are on the planet the more often viruses like Covid19 which are more contagious but less lethal than Ebola will connect us And that is a big problem not only because science in the absence of a vaccine still medicalises a pandemic almost entirely driven by our social responses but because there are more of us to circulate and adapt to that viral information This really matters with Covid19 since if lasting immunity doesnt happen soon we need to rethink the social contract in ways that run counter to those who advocate for biodeterminism or xenophobic scapegoating or maximising selfinterest Otherwise when the pandemic abates even temporarily we risk going back to normal forgetting what we might have learned until the next infectious disease outbreak when we will again be completely surprised by what we should have expected We need to consider the needy before that happens to put heart and soul into thinking about both how we live together with uncomfortable uncertainty and how we address together the social and cultural drivers of health vulnerability 1 SonarGlobal 2 David Napier et al Culture and health The Lancet vol 384 1

novel coronavirus which has taken a substantial toll not just on Iran but inside its government US policymakers are asking whether deaths within the regime are widespread enough that they could alter decisionmaking although a deadly rocket attack Wednesday in Iraq which Washington blamed on Iran showed at least that the cycle of conflict between the countries is not abating COVID19 which has infected tens of thousands of people around the world has hit Iran is government unusually hard with a number of senior politicians and officials killed or infected by the disease including a vice president a senior adviser to the foreign minister and a powerful cleric General Kenneth McKenzie head of Central Command which covers the Middle East said the United States believed the impact was worse than the more than 500 deaths reported the world is third highest toll after China and Italy and said US policymakers were assessing the political ramifications Of course death is permanent McKenzie told reporters Friday In the short term it is going to make it a lot harder to make decisions People are separated A day earlier McKenzie told a Senate hearing that the health crisis two months after Iranian public outrage over the accidental downing of a civilian Ukrainian plane made the leadership more dangerous as it would likely seek to unite the masses of its people against an external target There is very little evidence in the history of warfare of a regime that has a crippling internal problem that decides to focus on the crippling internal problem he said Weakened by US sanctions President Donald Trump closely allied with Iran is regional adversaries Saudi Arabia and Israel has sought to debilitate the Shiite clerical regime through sweeping sanctions including on Iran is key export of oil Nearly two years ago Trump bolted from an agreement brokered by his predecessor Barack Obama under which Iran drastically scaled back nuclear activities in return for promises of economic relief Even with Trump exempting humanitarian goods from sanctions few companies are willing to risk US wrath by selling to Iran The current crisis in Iran is really one that has been the result of the government is own missteps in its policies rather than the American sanctions said Amir Afkhami a professor at George Washington University who has studied Iran is public health system But the American sanctions have certainly contributed to worsening an already very bad situation Iran has historically boasted one of the region is strongest public health systems Afkhami cited unconfirmed reports that some officials have flown to Lebanon for treatment as a sign of the burden on Iranian hospitals While Iran recently ordered a nationwide lockdown for coronavirus testing Afkhami said action had come too late Reliant on Chinese trade in the face of US sanctions Iran failed to cut off air links with China when the epidemic emerged and as late as February was still exporting domesticallymade face masks Afkhami said As a physician I can say it would make sense that the disease has taken a particularly significant toll amongst Iran is aging leadership How much that has arrested the ability of the leadership to make policy decisions that is very difficult for me to say partly because the policy towards the coronavirus was anemic even before the outbreak made its way into Iran Regime still standing Trump has volunteered to assist Iran with the State Department communicating US willingness formally through Swiss intermediaries although it was unclear if Washington has made concrete offers or if Tehran would accept them One key test will be if the United States blocks Iran is request for an IMF loan the first sought by Tehran since the late shah is era Barbara Slavin director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council doubted the impact of coronavirus deaths on the sprawling leadership Iran has experienced extraordinary pressure since the US imposed the oil embargo with blow after blow but the regime is still there she said The big exception she said would be if the pandemic somehow reaches Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei an 80yearold whose health has long been the subject of speculation Khamenei has described COVID19 as a biological weapon a charge Washington scoffed at With Trump under fire at home over his handling of the outbreak a rocket attack Wednesday on an Iraqi base killed two US personnel and a British soldier The United States attributed the attack to a proIranian paramilitary force and

its latest bloody conflict that is plunging it ever deeper into chaos Russia Turkey the United Arab Emirates and others have fuelled the fighting in the oilrich but povertystricken North African nation where hundreds have been killed and over 150000 displaced Medical experts warn that Libya is at heightened risk of the fastspreading COVID19 illness given the deteriorated public health system in the gateway country for desperate Europebound migrants As much of the world has hunkered down militias in the south of the capital Tripoli have kept firing bullets mortars and grenades at each other the explosions echoing across the city Libya has been gripped by chaos for almost a decade since longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi was brought down and killed in a 2011 uprising backed by several Western powers It is now split between the UNrecognised Government of National Accord GNA in Tripoli and forces loyal to easternbased strongman Khalifa Haftar who launched his offensive to try to capture the capital on April 4 last year One year on and several failed ceasefires later we are simply witnessing the decimation of a nation said analyst Jalel Harchaoui of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague The United Nations envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame threw in the towel in early March following the repeated failure of efforts to restore order although he said his resignation was for health reasons A Berlin summit in late January saw Moscow Ankara and other foreign players engaged in Libya pledge to respect an arms embargo and support a truce But barely 10 days later Salame was denouncing violations and a continuous influx of foreign arms and mercenaries Existential battle Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has openly sent military equipment and fighters to the GNA Russia Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have meanwhile supported what Haftar claims is a campaign against jihadist terrorists and criminals As Haftar is offensive has so far failed to take Tripoli said Harchaoui Erdogan is government has been able to increase its presence and influence in the Libyan capital In recent months Erdogan sent hundreds of proTurkish Syrian fighters to battle the proHaftar forces who are supported by Russian mercenaries Moscow denies having sent Armed groups from western Libya are fighting Haftar forces in an existential battle said Wolfram Lacher of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs Haftar is forces are notorious for looting and summary executions and they include groups that are motivated by a thirst for revenge against entire communities he said The fear of war crimes of collective punishment of marginalisation under dictatorial rule means that the forces fighting against Haftar will not give up easily Fighting has intensified in recent days despite the latest pledges by both sides to accept UN and international calls for a humanitarian truce to help contain the coronavirus The international community is distraction linked to COVID19 has accelerated and exacerbated this escalation which in any case was inevitable said Harchaoui Libya has confirmed just a handful of cases so far but the UN aid agency OCHA has warned it is at high risk of the spread of COVID19 given its levels of insecurity weak health system and high numbers of migrants refugees and internally displaced persons Situation unbearable A few days ago the GNA even announced a counteroffensive paradoxically named peace storm Fighting is still concentrated south of Tripoli and east of the coastal city of Misrata after proHaftar forces in early January captured Sirte some 250 kilometres 150 miles away Fears of war and disease have piled on misery for the displaced such as Fatma Khairi who has taken refuge in a school building in the working class district of Abu Slim in the south of Tripoli I have a lot of trouble with the communal toilets where often there is no water or soap she told AFP My family and I live in dramatic conditions that I can hardly describe to you The situation has become unbearable The humanitarian situation is likely to deteriorate as the world faces a deep economic crisis and a further slump in the price of oil Libya is main source of income ProHaftar forces have already shuttered the country is main oil fields and production has come to a virtual standstill A political resolution to the conflict seems remote said both Lacher and Harchaoui who agreed that the international community would have to pressure the outside powers especially the United Arab Emirates If no Western state agrees to contradict the UAE even a little an even more serious deterioration of the conflict will be inevitable said Harchaoui Lacher judged that for now Western states are not ready to exert meaningful pressure on Haftar and the UAE As long as this is the case the prospects for a political solution are virtually nonexistent ndrbilafzdr

release its proposal for the EUs next longterm budget revised to confront the shockwaves caused by the COVID19 pandemic Commission President von der Leyen has framed the 20212027 Multiannual Financial Framework MFF as the EUs Marshall Plan for postCOVID19 recovery The task of both containing COVID19 and dealing with the economic shockwaves is hitting Europe hard Its impact in fragile states beset by violence poverty weak services and abusive leadership could prove many times worse In the EU budget member states and the European Parliament have an opportunity to adopt a strong package of prevention measures to protect Europe of the future in a coherent sustainable way COVID19 as a catalyst of conflict and rights abuses COVID19 will have devastating impacts in fragile states and catalyse new instability In South Sudan in a context of insecurity hunger and weak institutions COVID19 has the potential to set in train a humanitarian catastrophe that could intensify conflict between communities In the Sahel lockdowns and the closure of borders limit access to trade livelihoods and services for people already under pressure from conflict and climate change The pressure brought by COVID19 could push vulnerable communities into conflict Refugees migrants and internally displaced people IDPs are particularly vulnerable to COVID19 due to cramped conditions in camps limited access to information and restricted movement as countries close their doors to refugees The imposition of emergency measures in a climate of fear could have profoundly destabilising consequences Governments are already taking advantage of the pandemic to harden the security response and crack down on political movements with emergency laws deepening repressive governance In the Philippines President Duterte has ordered the police and military to shoot people who protest the governments COVID19 measures Similarly the abuses committed by security forces in Chad have created insecurity among the population A lack of international attention in conflictaffected and unstable countries could create zones of impunity and enable atrocities Women are facing an increased risk of genderbased violence by partners and security forces as justice systems become overwhelmed Given that a 5 decline in economic growth increases the likelihood of conflict by half in the following year it is rational to expect that the economic shock from COVID19 combined with existing inequality exclusion and impunity could feed social tensions and violence What should EU leaders do differently When revising the MFF the EU needs to develop a coherent response to the tide of instability that will follow COVID19 The 2016 Global Strategy identified prevention of pandemics and conflict as priorities However member states have focused disproportionately on shortterm domestic security priorities rather than addressing the drivers of conflict Underpinning this trend have been unbalanced threat assessments migrant arrivals and armed groups outside Europe have increasingly crowded out all other considerations to be contained through investment in militarised responses In February while the virus had already claimed thousands of lives the EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called the EU to provide more guns to Africa to tackle the danger posed by armed groups As the pandemic unfolded the European Commission announced 160 million to boost the defence industry COVID19 has highlighted the weaknesses of the EUs focus on counterterrorism and migration control Hard security approaches such as training and equipping third country security forces through migration partnerships or the proposed European Peace Facility do little to address threats posed by pandemics climate change inequality and abusive regimes Instead these approaches compound violence and grievances strengthening authoritarian leaders whose behaviour worsens systemic problems In its budget negotiations the EU has an opportunity to revive the comprehensive approach of the Global Strategy and invest in a strategic prevention response to the instability COVID19 will unleash There are several ways in which European leaders could bolster conflict prevention in the next MFF Addressing conflict drivers by incentivising rightsbased governance inclusive decisionmaking human security access to healthcare food security and gender equality are essential International oversight is needed to ensure that governments do not use COVID19 to justify securitised approaches limit civil liberties or oppress populations The MFF should condition further funding on the safeguarding of democracy and civil society and be backed by robust monitoring mechanisms Do no harm considerations are too often an afterthought in times of crisis or rapid change The MFF should assert that sensitivity to the risks of fuelling divisions are inbuilt to Europes COVID19 response and that more assistance will go through local civil society and womens organisations who are best placed to address the priorities of communities sensitively and legitimately In a postCOVID19 world protecting the security of Europeans will depend on holistic strategies to address longterm systemic threats Finding money for arms manufacturers and migration containment while underresourcing prevention and solidarity with affected populations not only fails to mitigate the destabilising impacts of COVID19 but reinforces the failed approaches of the past ulliLucia Montanaro is Saferworlds Head of EU Office Tuuli Räty is

internationally recognized government and Houthi rebels who control the capital and most of the countrys north to quickly resolve their differences over humanitarian and economic measures needed to move peace efforts forward and help the country counter the virus Griffiths spoke to the UN Security Council in a video briefing saying that steps to allow medical supplies and personnel to reach vulnerable people are now a very very urgent priority He did not elaborate on progress in peace talks Despite Saudi Arabia is unilateral ceasefire declaration last month the conflict has escalated and a declaration of selfrule over the south by Yemens separatists reopened a dangerous new front Griffiths to UNSC We have seen significant progress on negotiations particularly with the ceasefire which responds to the calls of Yemenis Differences remain on some of the humanitarian economic measures all of which I believe to be necessaryoverdue OSE_Yemen OSE_Yemen May 14 2020 Yemen has so far reported 86 cases of the virus including 13 deaths The internationally recognized government and WHO have criticized the rebels for their lack of transparency as just two cases including one death have been recorded in territory under their control With the drastic spike in cases over the last 10 days across farflung provinces Ramesh Rajasingham the UNs acting assistant secretarygeneral for humanitarian affairs warned that community transmission has taken off He said it is shocking that in the midst of a pandemic relief money is running out and that 31 of the 41 major UN programs in Yemen will start closing down in the next few weeks if more funding isnt secured including COVID19 response teams and feeding centers for severely malnourished children That means many more people are likely to die he said appealing for an additional 2 billion to cover essential activities from June through December Saudi Arabia and the United Nations will host a virtual pledging conference on June

civilians killed or injured Griffiths said he remains extremely concerned about the battle in Marib heavy fighting in Bayda and Dhale governorates and ceasefire violations in Hodeida where the countrys main port is located Fierce clashes erupted this week in the southern province of Abyan between Saudibacked government troops and separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates The fighting between the two sides nominally allies in the Saudiled coalition has added another layer to the complex civil war The Security Council later reiterated support for SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres call for a ceasefire in Yemen and expressed concern at fighting between the government and the Houthis and the slow pace of negotiations toward a ceasefire Members also called on the government and southern separatists to deescalate military tensions and engage on a peace deal brokered by the Saudis and on the separatists to reverse any actions challenging the legitimacy sovereignty unity or territorial integrity of Yemen Griffiths said people especially in the southern port city of Aden face outbreaks of COVID19 and other diseases believed to include malaria cholera and dengue and others Deaths are rising daily but nobody knows exactly why because the health system is so illequipped to diagnose and treat people he said Adens local government reported 70 deaths on Wednesday and 76 the day before a fivefold daily increase from the first week of May The causes of death were unspecified Save the Children suggested in a statement on Thursday that some of the deaths in the unusual surge in fatalities could be from COVID19 the illness caused by coronavirus It said many Aden hospitals and clinics have closed and in those still open some staff refuse to work because of severe shortages of protective equipment The groups Yemen director Mohammed Alshamaa says aid workers have witnessed many desperate patients breathing heavily or even collapsing and being denied entry to hospitals Aden and its surroundings have recently been hit by torrential rains becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry dengue and chikungunya which can cause fevers and respiratory symptoms similar to COVID19 Aden is an example of the horrors that face Yemen Griffiths said pointing also to the citys damaged infrastructure serious power outages and longdeteriorating public services now at a breaking point Rajasingham the humanitarian official pointed to an April 6 attack by armed men who threw grenades at the guards of an isolation center at a Dhale hospital adding that fear of stigma may also be leading fewer people to seek medical care when they need it As for refugees asylumseekers and migrants he said stigma is already a grave concern AP

variable the novel coronavirus which has taken a substantial toll not just on Iran but inside its government US policymakers are asking whether deaths within the regime are widespread enough that they could alter decisionmaking although a deadly rocket attack Wednesday in Iraq which Washington blamed on Iran showed at least that the cycle of conflict between the countries is not abating COVID19 which has infected tens of thousands of people around the world has hit Iran is government unusually hard with a number of senior politicians and officials killed or infected by the disease including a vice president a senior adviser to the foreign minister and a powerful cleric General Kenneth McKenzie head of Central Command which covers the Middle East said the United States believed the impact was worse than the more than 500 deaths reported the world is third highest toll after China and Italy and said US policymakers were assessing the political ramifications Of course death is permanent McKenzie told reporters Friday In the short term it is going to make it a lot harder to make decisions People are separated A day earlier McKenzie told a Senate hearing that the health crisis two months after Iranian public outrage over the accidental downing of a civilian Ukrainian plane made the leadership more dangerous as it would likely seek to unite the masses of its people against an external target There is very little evidence in the history of warfare of a regime that has a crippling internal problem that decides to focus on the crippling internal problem he said President Donald Trump closely allied with Iran is regional adversaries Saudi Arabia and Israel has sought to debilitate the Shiite clerical regime through sweeping sanctions including on Iran is key export of oil Nearly two years ago Trump bolted from an agreement brokered by his predecessor Barack Obama under which Iran drastically scaled back nuclear activities in return for promises of economic relief Even with Trump exempting humanitarian goods from sanctions few companies are willing to risk US wrath by selling to Iran The current crisis in Iran is really one that has been the result of the government is own missteps in its policies rather than the American sanctions said Amir Afkhami a professor at George Washington University who has studied Iran is public health system But the American sanctions have certainly contributed to worsening an already very bad situation Iran has historically boasted one of the region is strongest public health systems Afkhami cited unconfirmed reports that some officials have flown to Lebanon for treatment as a sign of the burden on Iranian hospitals While Iran recently ordered a nationwide lockdown for coronavirus testing Afkhami said action had come too late Reliant on Chinese trade in the face of US sanctions Iran failed to cut off air links with China when the epidemic emerged and as late as February was still exporting domesticallymade face masks Afkhami said As a physician I can say it would make sense that the disease has taken a particularly significant toll amongst Iran is aging leadership How much that has arrested the ability of the leadership to make policy decisions that is very difficult for me to say partly because the policy towards the coronavirus was anemic even before the outbreak made its way into Iran Trump has volunteered to assist Iran with the State Department communicating US willingness formally through Swiss intermediaries although it was unclear if Washington has made concrete offers or if Tehran would accept them One key test will be if the United States blocks Iran is request for an IMF loan the first sought by Tehran since the late shah is era Barbara Slavin director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council doubted the impact of coronavirus deaths on the sprawling leadership Iran has experienced extraordinary pressure since the US imposed the oil embargo with blow after blow but the regime is still there she said The big exception she said would be if the pandemic somehow reaches Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei an 80yearold whose health has long been the subject of speculation Khamenei has described COVID19 as a biological weapon a charge Washington scoffed at With Trump under fire at home over his handling of the outbreak a rocket attack Wednesday on an Iraqi base killed two US personnel and a British soldier The United States attributed the attack to a proIranian paramilitary force and launched retaliatory air strikes the latest round in a conflict that included the US killing of a top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January I think this pattern will continue especially because the Trump administration like so many other governments is completely distracted Slavin said The calculation in Iran must be that he cannot handle one crisis so how can he handle two at the same time

this virus we need to deal with it with a war economy They were the words of UN secretarygeneral Antonio Guterres as he used an interview with Euronews to call for a clear and coordinated global response to the coronavirus crisis Guterres said he wanted to mobilise a double digit percentage of the global economy to break not bendthe growth curve of coronavirus And it is not only breaking the curve of the virus that should be at the forefront of global efforts he said but to also seize the dramatic situation as an opporunityto create an economy that is more inclusive and sustainable going forward Many things will change I would say irreversibly in our liveshe told Euronews He also said Countries have been slow in reacting to coronavirus crisis but now is not the time for a blame game If we do not tackle the COVID19 crisis millions of people could be infected and die The crisis will be much more serious if there is no strategy or coordination Special initiatives are being formulated to try to silence the gunsof war around the world as there is only one war that is needed it is a war against the virus As of Wednesday evening there were more than 450000 cases of COVID19 confirmed worldwide with more than 20000 deaths Interview transcription Isabelle Kumar Euronews You have said the whole world must fight to stop this pandemic reaching apocalyptic proportions Pinpoint for us and briefly the concrete measures you are calling for to be taken globally Antonio Guterres I think that we need to be clear on our strategy And our strategy is to suppress COVID19 And we can only suppress COVID19 if all the countries have an articulated plan of action combining of course testing tracing and quarantine with the measures of restriction of movement and contact And of course this is to be done probably differently depending on the testing capacity of each country where testing and tracing is less effective more lockdowns will be necessary But these needs to be done in a coordinated way to suppress COVID19 in the developed world and then with a very strong capacity to help the developing countries to do the same We need to have a clear strategy It is not just to I would say mitigate If you look at the curve of the cases we need to break that curve Not only to bend the curve We need to suppress And then we need to mobilise what I believe is required which is a double digit percentage of the economy at national level and of the global economy in order to address the socioeconomic consequences of this disease And this is not the financial crisis like 2008 Of course we need to keep the liquidity of the financial systems but it is essential to support people and businesses It is essential to make livelihoods work It is essential to keep ourselves afloat and businesses afloat And this is the support that is absolutely crucial This is being done in several countries But again it needs to be done in a coordinated way at the level of the G20 and then it needs to mobilise and I estimate that we will need about 25 to 3 trillion dollars to help the developing countries do the same The IMF has already a lending capacity of about 1 billion We need special drawing rights that in a war economy we need to print money The way to print money globally is through special drawing rights to put at the disposal of the developing world mobilise all other international financial institutions increase the swaps between central banks especially to help the emerging economies to be able to concentrate this huge volume of resources for the developing countries also to be able to address the challenges to their societies And then finally I think we need to prepare a recovery and to prepare a recovery for a better economy a more sustainable and inclusive economy We do not need to replicate exactly the economy of the past Many things will change I would say irreversibly in our lives We need to be able to use this dramatic situation also to seize it as an opportunity to make our capacity to have more inclusiveness and more sustainability in our economies prevail Kumar Mr Guterres these are very high ambitions at a time when the world is on its knees We see strong economies like the EU buckling The US is in the firing line You are calling for trillions to be mobilised here But at a time of global pandemic leadership seems to be in short supply So do you think that now we require a new global mechanism that would supersede sovereign states to deal with pandemics as we all face the future pandemics in the future Guterres Well I have just suggested that the G20 should create immediately a mechanism of coordination of their own response to the pandemic and that the guidance of the World Health Organization these needs to be done in a systematic coordinated way We cannot have completely different policies from country to country if they are not articulated to a common objective which is to suppress the vitals Look the American senate is discussing a two trillion dollar package and two trillion dollars corresponds exactly to close to 10 percent of their GDP which means we are coming close to this two digit approach percentage approach of the global economy that will be necessary And there are ways to do it If we do it in a coordinated way I think the G20 will be an excellent opportunity to bring things together and to create the conditions the IMF the international financial institutions the central banks to produce what is necessary As I said in a world economy you print money in a modern way but you print money in a way also that expresses solidarity to the developing world not only boosting the response each of the developed countries but creating the conditions for that to be done worldwide Kumar If the past is anything to look from solidarity has been in short supply especially when it comes to developing nations the ultra vulnerable as you have called them now You were the UN High Commissioner for Refugees You know the situation in these refugee camps unhygienic best conditions people living in overcrowded conditions as well What do these people need the most urgently when you call for this solidarity Guterres Well they need everything We have just issued the interagency plan a humanitarian response plan addressing exactly the response to COVID19 in those situations that are already under enormous humanitarian stress areas of conflict fragile states refugee camps internal displacement camps and to create the conditions to make sure that in these areas you will have medical capacity You will have testing kits You will have the equipment that is necessary to treat patients at the same time that you have water and soap and points of water and soap with people to wash their hands that you have the capacity to address the needs of the health staff that is working in such terrible circumstances All these in a package that brought together UN agencies NGOs appealing to the world to 2 billion US dollars of funds in order to respond exactly to those situations in the most vulnerable of the vulnerable countries in the world Kumar Yes vulnerable communities are really on the front line of this and they will bear the full brunt of this kind of this coronavirus crisis But do you think the World Health Organization was too slow to react to this given that there were warnings of humantohuman transmission of the coronavirus back in December Guterres I think the World Health Organization has issued clear guidelines Since the beginning I think member states were slow in reacting But now the question is not to enter into a blame game with ones blaming the others The action that is needed is to bring everybody together in a coordinated way to suppress the vitals and to make sure that the people and the businesses need to survive are effectively helped by a massive mobilisation of funds that to the present situation requires We are living in a war situation against the virus We need to deal with it with a war economy Kumar You talk about a war economy war situation but you have also called for a global ceasefire Again some might say that is very ambitious with war raging on so many fronts Now you are obviously in contact with warring factions Is that being taken on board by any of these factions Guterres Yes we have the first of all all my special envoys and representatives are developing initiatives in order from Syria to Yemen to Libya to all other places in order to make sure that the guns are silenced And several of the movements have already responded positively In some places we are seeing even cooperation in addressing the COVID19 response Unfortunately in other situations things are going on especially when we have terrorist organisations that do not respect anyone or anybody You have seen this attack in Chad that killed 93 soldiers And I want to express my deep condolences to the Chadian people But I feel that there is a growing conscious that there is only one war that is needed It is a war against the virus Kumar Okay war against the virus But for ordinary people this is going to mean a massive change to their lives The ILO has said that some 25 million people could lose their jobs Now translate this crisis this coronavirus crisis the recession the depression that might follow into what this means for ordinary people around the globe Guterres But that is exactly why it is necessary to be clear in the strategy The strategy is to suppress the virus and to create the conditions for an early recovery When that is done in a way in which everybody works together it is not just to keep I would say a mitigation effort that will make it last for months and months and months Now we must break the curve We must suppress the virus to limit exactly the impact that you are seeing And at the same time we need to mobilise those resources I mentioned to a double digit of the global economy Exactly to support the people that are losing their jobs or losing their salaries Exactly to support the businesses that we must make survive in order to then push for the recovery of the economy as soon as we control the disease Kumar In a word Mr Guterres are you hopeful this is gonna happen Guterres Well I think that people are gaining conscious that this is serious and this is going to be much more serious if there is no solidarity and if there is no effective coordination If we just let the virus go we are talking of millions of people being infected and millions of people that can die And we absolutely need to avoid it So tough measures in an articulated way under the guidance of WHO to suppress the virus and the very dramatic mobilisation of resources in order to be able to keep households and businesses afloat Watch the interview in full Click here Click to view image

hampered his ability to mobilize people for labor During Thursday meeting Kim said it was clear after three weeks of isolation measures and cientific verificationhat the virus situation in Kaesong was stable and expressed gratitude to residents for cooperating with the lockdown KCNA reported Kim said his country now faces a dual challenge of fending off COVID19 amid a worsening global pandemic and repairing damage from torrential rain that lashed the country in past weeks KCNA said 39296 hectares 97100 acres of crops were ruined nationwide and 16680 homes and 630 public buildings destroyed or

Ewha University in Seoul Cho Heysil spokesperson of Seoul Unification Ministry which handles interKorean affairs said the South remains willing to provide humanitarian assistance to the North North Korea in past months has severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang which faltered over disagreements in

authorities say the 24yearold hadn tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any known virus carrier North Korea later said the person test results were inconclusive and still

largest city Even as a strict lockdown to slow the coronavirus pandemic is eased many foreigners living in this country have no work and are hungry South Africa is the continent is secondlargest economy and a magnet for millions of refugees and migrants from elsewhere But the vast majority of them depend on daytoday work and this informal source of income catastrophically dried up from one day to the next because of the lockdown In a country considered by the World Bank to be the most unequal in the world many of these luckless people now have nothing I see a lot of community members suffering because of this lockdown said Alfred Djang a 50yearold lawyer who left the Democratic Republic of Congo 19 years ago Some had been working in shops they were selling things on street corners but they are not allowed to do it anymore Djang said They do not have permits so they need to beg for food here and there he added Hunger has no colour Amir Sheikh head of the African Diaspora Forum said his nonprofit group had been swamped by requests for help Since the beginning of the lockdown we have initiated a process of cooking food for the migrants the Somali said Funded by religious organisations his network provides 3500 parcels and 750 meals each week It is very important because those people have been neglected hunger has no colour but unfortunately the government of South Africa has discriminated against us on the basis of our country of origin he said As part of an unprecedented emergency plan President Cyril Ramaphosa announced food distributions and a monthly allowance of 350 rand 20 18 euros for the most destitute Neither Ramaphosa nor his ministers have mentioned any conditions for the nationality of people receiving the aid But migrants and nongovernmental organisations insist that in defacto terms the help goes to South Africans While the rainbow nation Nelson Mandela dreamed of has some four million foreigners most of them do not have

assistance at an NGO called Lawyers for Human Rights said the authorities had systematically refused to help foreigners There has not been a single refugee that has confirmed with me that their application is through that they qualify and they are going to get a grant she said This is a serious crisis Questioned by AFP the social development ministry declined to comment before an upcoming court case over the conditions under which its aid is distributed Ekambaram said a hotline set up last week offering legal advice received more than 700 calls within days of grants being announced many asking about food We have seen children going to hospitals being diagnosed as malnourished she said Even though apartheid ended a generation ago South Africa is still struggling with rampant inequality and poverty which in turn have fed ugly xenophobia After a surge in violence and mob attacks in September against foreignowned businesses in and around Johannesburg Ramaphosa was booed at the funeral of his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe South Africa is not xenophobic he pleaded at the time Institutional xenophobia But ambiguities in his government is policies have been laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic Last month Finance Minister Tito Mboweni called for locals to be favoured for jobs as the country emerges from the crisis The proportion of South Africans working in a restaurant must be greater than that of nonSouth Africans he declared Dewa Mavhinga of Human Rights Watch HRW said the pandemic had brought this type of discourse to the surface A number of migrants have no access to food they are facing starvation It is a blatant violation of their basic rights it points to a pattern of institutionalised xenophobia Mavhinga said South African authorities have an obligation to support and provide assistance to those in needs who are unable to find food he said If the South African government is unable to help them because of lack of resources it must open up to international supporters to step in In its defence the government says it has set up a Solidarity Fund to coordinate emergency food aid and no proof of identity is required from beneficiaries The Solidarity Fund is response was to roll out a humanitarian relief effort aimed at assisting vulnerable families experiencing severe food insecurity across South Africa irrespective of their nationality said Thandeka Ncube head of humanity support But many illegal immigrants prefer to keep their distance from these handouts dreading that they will be picked up say grassroots workers

he too has received no help from the authorities Humanity should come first Some shopkeepers are asking their clients for an ID before selling them some food Jibro said If you cannot show any ID they tell you go elsewhere go elsewhere he added Thanks to the generosity of his community his association has been able to feed around a thousand Ethiopian families most of them undocumented or asylum seekers Some people are bringing us food parcels That is how we survive now said a 47yearold Ethiopian woman who asked to remain anonymous She fled repression in her country and has been living in Johannesburg with her three children without a residence permit since 2008 She said she believed the government should help her family because we are living here in this country Humanity should come first before any document Some consulates in neighbouring countries have recently expressed interest in arranging the repatriation of their citizens stranded in South Africa during the pandemic That is a possibility which Im considering said Collin Makumbirofa a 41yearold Zimbabwean who has been living in the overcrowded Alexandra township in Johannesburg for more than a decade As foreign

Tuesday April 28 at 0601 am CET The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA has warned that the coronavirus pandemic could spell disaster for womens rights around the world It says lockdowns and school closures designed to contain the spread of COVID19 could critically undermine progress made in family planning as well as causing an increase in child marriage and female genital mutilation It is a catastrophic situation UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem told Euronews Given that women and girls were already at a disadvantage when it came to contraception now that we have layered the COVID pandemic on top of that we are calculating that millions of women and girls around the world are going to be at risk of violence They are going to be at risk of unintended pregnancies and unattended pregnancies without a midwife as well as things like child marriage as the pandemic rages on UNFPA the UN agency focused on sexual and reproductive health examines how lockdowns are disrupting access to family planning health services and prevention programmes that make a major difference for women in low and middleincome countries As many countries restrict movement to fight the spread of COVID19 and the crisis heaps social and economic stress on families the United Nations has warned of a horrifying global surge in domestic violence It says that the number of women and girls facing abuse has increased in almost all countries and that in the next six months alone over 30 million women will suffer violence as a result of COVID19 confinement measures This during a lockdown is very disturbing You are trapped in a physical situation and if you are overpowered you may not be able to get out of it This is why UNFPA is emphasising things like hotlines We are emphasising no disruption in the services that women and girls need in times of crisis Kanem said Contraception out of stock The coronavirus pandemic is disrupting family planning in several ways says UNFPA A number of health facilities are limiting their services while women are refraining from visiting them because of movement restrictions or because they fear catching the virus Meanwhile supply chain disruptions are limiting the availability of contraceptives Clinics in more than a dozen of the world is poorest countries expect to go out of stock within the next six months In that context the UNFPA estimates that for every three months of lockdown disruptions ulliBetween 13 million and 51 million women who otherwise would have used modern contraceptives will be unable toliliThis could result in at least 325000 unintended pregnancies in the best of scenarios and up to 15 million unintended pregnancies if major disruptions go on for a yearliliThere will be an additional 15 million cases of genderbased violence and up to 61 million if lockdown restrictions remain in place for a whole yearliulGirls at risk of mutilation and child marriage More broadly the UNFPA expects the fight against COVID19 to delay by up to two years the launch of community programmes aiming to prevent child marriages and female genital mutilation It now estimates that ulliTwo million women and girls will suffer female genital mutilation over the next decade when such practices could have otherwise been avertedliliThere will be some 13 million additional child marriages over the next decade that also could have been preventedliulThe economic fallout from the pandemic is also to blame for these projections The International Monetary Fund has already warned that the world now faces its worst economic drop since the Great Depression of the 1930s This economic downturn will likely have a large impact on poverty levels in lowincome countries where child marriage is most prevalent Because poverty is a key driver of child marriage these economic impacts are anticipated to increase rates of child marriage in vulnerable communities said UNFPA As a whole it warns that the coronavirus pandemic could critically undermine the progress made towards achieving the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of ending unmet need for family planning ending genderbased violence including FGM and child marriage and ending all preventable maternal deaths Working without US funding The United States suspended funding for UNFPA in 2017 claiming it supported a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China The agency has repeatedly refuted the claim saying all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions free of coercion or discrimination The move came after the Trump administration reinstated a controversial policy also known as the global gag rule that prohibits organisations receiving US government funding from facilitating or providing information about abortion Asked how the funding cut had affected the UNFPA is work and what advice the agency would have for the World Health Organization which now finds itself in a similar position Kanem hailed the WHO is extraordinary job holding together a fractionated world At this time multilateralism has led the way in saying we must stick together swim together and not sink together So it is disturbing when funding is withdrawn However I believe that goodwill and our activities and actions on the ground is what makes the case Kanem said In the case of UNFPA the funding cut meant the agency had to close some of its clinics I just reviewed our programme in Yemen a humanitarian situation of great tragic importance where we had to close over 100 of our clinics where we save maternal lives where we give contraception to women who do not wish to become pregnant under a pandemic or any other circumstance Kanem said But I believe that people of goodwill

unemployment and a food shortage but battling infectious Covid19 could push it over its tipping point according to Michele Bachelet UN high commissioner for human rights The health system is simply not equipped to handle an outbreak on the scale we have seen elsewhere in the world There is only one way to prevent a humanitarian disaster and that is for the donors to step up and extend a helping hand to Sudan Bachelet said this week Basic medical supplies such as masks have tripled in price as Sudanese on lockdown try to protect themselves Sudan does not have the resources to test suspected cases and the numbers of people suffering from Covid19 have risen to 375 with 28 deaths according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention The idea of the perfect storm is overused but in this context it actually may be apt because of this interlocking between political problems healthcare problems economic problems and food problems says Harry Verhoeven senior advisor for the European Institute of Peace EIP a Brussels thinktank The clouds are unusually dark hanging over a region that is quite used to bad news this is not good he adds US sanctions bars aid for Sudan US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok in April to discuss the possibility of removing Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism For Sudanese Covid19 adds complications to economic crisis A year after Bashir is ouster Sudan moves towards civilian rule despite problems Some called it yet another empty gesture from the US which has banned Sudanese from obtaining visas under the Trump administration The United States has moved the goalposts for 15 to 20 years so Pompeo is statement will not necessarily be seen as truly credible says Verhoeven Verhoeven says that reaching a political settlement in Sudan will not necessarily result in the US removing sanctions It is a promise that has been broken too many times he adds Lifting the pariah state sanctions could help during the Covid19 crisis according to the UN is Bachelet Sudan is ineligible to access the US50billion fund made available by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to assist countries to fight coronavirus The only way Sudan will ever be able to break out of this cycle of poverty and desperation is to be freed from the impediments of sanctions imposed at the time of the previous government says the UN official This would enable Sudan to attract investment for its muchneeded economic reforms and to fully access funds of the international financial institutions she adds Darfur a key piece of the puzzle Reports of breakthroughs made in the Juba peace talks which are now conducted remotely due to Covid19 including allocating 40 percent of Darfur is natural resources to the region itself were treated with scepticism this week After 20 years of war there are massive questions around land ownership tenure about changes in in economic livelihood compensation for those who have lost says EIP senior advisor Verhoeven But he tells RFI that conducting the Juba peace talks indicates that some in the government believe Darfur really needs to be solved after 20 years of fighting of killing of displacements These are very tricky political questions questions that will be difficult even without the legacy of war They are particularly fraught he adds The situation is further compounded by the state of emergency in Darfur according to Salih Osman vice president of the Darfuri Bar Association a human rights law organisation This state of emergency is a tool that was used by the previous regime to suppress people in Darfur with regular government forces and the Janjaweed using this to implement the law says Osman referring to soldiers and armed militias who hunted down Darfuris on behalf of Omar alBashir is government The state of emergency enabled the authorities to carry out human rights violations stop people from gathering communicating and having their voice heard according to Osman Osman went to Darfuri internally displaced camps late last year to speak to people there Even after the installation of the transitional government they told him violations continue to occur According to the UN nearly 2 million of Sudan is 42 million population remain internally displaced as a result of conflicts in Darfur South Kordofan and Blue Nile state Most face dire conditions living in camps or settlements unable to meet their basic needs according to UN is Bachelet In South Darfur internally displaced people at Kalma camp which houses 90000 are not allowed to even go to Nyala city the capital of the state which is on the outskirts of the camp according to Osman Impunity in Darfur The lack of accountability arbitrary arrest and detention during the state of emergency is demonstrated by the recent reports of violence including murder rape and arson says Osman Crimes are happening on a daily basis There is still an absence of justice and accountability because the old regime members are beyond the reach of justice says Osman One member of the powersharing transitional government General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo aka Hemeti deputy of the Sovereignty Council was the head of the Janjaweed militia later rebranded as the Rapid Support Forces RSF The RSF carried out numerous human rights abuses as alleged by Human Rights Watch a USbased rights watchdog against the Darfuri people crimes that date from 2002 People are disappointed that they do not feel that there is a change at all they are telling me that elements of the previous regime are still controlling the institutions of the government in Darfur lawyer Osman says Osman says that even with the new government there is no accountability not even in terms of sending Omar alBashir the former president of Sudan and three others to the International Criminal Court ICC The men are charged with committing genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur The government had been saying we are assessing with the ICC how to surrender the accused Omar alBashir and three associates but they have dropped this issue because of coronavirus says Osman Inequality and economic and social grievances were the main triggers of Sudan is revolution last year If these and other root causes are not addressed as a matter of priority Sudan is

not wearing the correct equipment in public In Prague the capital the police have so far sanctioned more than 4000 people for failing to wear protective masks though only 22 cases were referred to municipal prosecutors according to a report by Dnes a daily newspaper on 23 March In most cases it seems police are simply advising people to respect this regulation rather than handing out financial penalties On Monday evening 23 March the government announced that restrictions of free movement and business closures which were supposed to end the following morning will remain in place for another week until 1 April Education Minister Robert Plaga has said that schools are likely to remain closed until the middle of May Despite the Czech governments insistence that people must still wear face masks at all times in public the global medical community remains divided on how effective they are at preventing the spread of COVID19 The World Health Organization for instance recommends the wearing of protective face masks though many experts are sceptical claiming that while they might slightly prevent spread of the virus for people in close contact to one another they are much less effective in stopping transmission outdoors A featured story in this mornings edition of Novinkycz an online news site warns that improperly treated masks may increase the risk of infection Quoting health officials from across the world it noted that surgical masks must be changed regularly whereas in the Czech Republic many people are wearing the same mask each day because of a shortage of stock and they can become contaminated easily after being touched Indeed concerns have been raised by Czech media in recent days that the demand for medical masks among the public because of the regulation is causing shortages in hospitals where they are needed most greatly Many pharmacies and hospitals have now run out of stock and the authorities are sequestering the current stock for use for doctors and other frontline medical staff and patients The shortage will likely be eased after China last week promised to deliver regular shipments of surgical masks and ventilators as well as other medical equipment On 20 March the first consignment of 11 million FFP2 respirators arrived in Prague on board a military plane from China It is not yet known how much the Czech government paid for these imports But the Czech Republics rush to stockpile surgical masks and respirators has come at a humanitarian cost too Last week a shipment more than 100000 medical masks on its way to Italy from China was confiscated by the Czech authorities after they seized more than 680000 masks and ventilators from a warehouse At first Prague claimed that all of the masks were confiscated from criminals looking to sell the masks on the black market Only later however did Interior Minister Jan Hamacek admit that many of these masks were actually part of the Chinese aid package to Italy now the worst affected country in the world for COVID19 Prague sent 110000 masks to Rome this week The Czech Republic certainly didnt steal anything Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek told AFP after the incident though it did little to dampen hostility in Italy and other states about the lack of European solidarity during this crisis

their houses and livestock due to fighting between the Tatmadaw military and the Kachin Independence Army KIA in June 2011 He recalled his family had to spend nearly two years in the jungle with little food until they reached St Joseph Pa La Na camp run by the Catholic Church in Myitkyina the capital of Kachin state in March 2013 More than 2000 Catholics and some Baptists live in the camp Zaw Lawt says he was working as a teacher at a churchrun primary school in a village in Suprabum township Kachin state where some 220 Catholic villagers live by farming We had to run away when most of the people were doing farm work as we heard gunfire near the village said Zaw Lawt a father of five The 53yearold ethnic Kachin said internally displaced persons IDPs had remained in the camps for nine years and depended on food and nonfood items supplied by the UN World Food Programme and Caritas Karuna Myanmar There isnt a single IDP who doesnt want to return to their place of origin but security

mainly depend on the progress of the peace process especially talks between the Tatmadaw and the KIA In December 2019 the Ministry of Social Welfare Relief and Resettlement unveiled a national

return to It drafted a plan with the state government for an estimated 10000 IDPs to return to 17 of them this year Aid groups warn that conditions must be safe before people can return home and that

coronavirus among the 18 million people displaced across the region by the decadelong Boko Haram insurgency Northeast Nigeria has yet to register any confirmed infections but aid workers fear the virus could rampage through the overcrowded camps a catastrophe for a population already living on the edge Around the regional capital Maiduguri hundreds of thousands are crammed into governmentcontrolled camps or huddled in makeshift shelters at unofficial locations Running water is rare and conditions are often squalid This epidemic is scary we ardently pray against it Aishatu Abubakar a resident of the Bakassi camp housing 30000 people told AFP It is a double calamity we have been grappling with insecurity and now this disease has reared its head Bunu Bukar Muhammad cofounder of local charity Smile Mission Healthcare has been trying to spread the word about coronavirus in the camp setting up facilities and teaching people how to wash their hands correctly But he admits there are major challenges in the crowded conditions Things like social distancing are quite difficult to adopt in this context he told AFP In a bid to prevent infections the local authorities have banned all visitors from entering the camps they control But those living in the informal settlements that stud the city insist that not enough is being done We have not received any aid at all said Umar Gwoza who lives with his family at one of the unofficial sites We are in need of hand gloves face masks and hand sanitiser to protect ourselves Really scary More than 10 years of jihadist rebellion has left northeast Nigeria in no state to deal with a global pandemic Only half of the roughly 700 health facilities in Borno state the epicentre of the violence are still working and many have been damaged by the fighting There is no health system to contain that virus and the sick It will spread like wildfire and affect all involved including security said one United Nations worker on condition of anonymity It is really scary Those living in the camps are no strangers to the spread of diseases Cholera has broken out repeatedly and aid workers are falling back on their experience of dealing with other diseases to try to stave off coronavirus But an easily transmitted virus could prove devastating in the camps even if the average age of the population is young For the IDPs internally displaced people if they get infected and need more help they cannot get it the UN worker said Their immune system will be easily compromised because of poor diet and other conditions like poor sanitation and lack of water Their situation could be dire The UN on Tuesday announced it was taking emergency preparedness and response measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus among the most vulnerable people in the northeast That means ensuring supplies of clean water helping to provide soap launching media campaigns on the coronavirus and scrambling to bring in crucial equipment such as ventilators from overseas A medical source told AFP that in Borno state there are currently only 10 ventilators which are needed for patients who are unable to breathe on their own because of lung damage caused by the virus Our priority is to ensure the continuous delivery of lifesaving assistance especially health services Edward Kallon the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria said in a statement More than ever it is crucial for vulnerable people to have access to not only water soap shelters but also food education and protection Damage to aid efforts Beyond the nightmare scenario of a major outbreak in the camps humanitarian organisations worry that global disruptions from the pandemic could soon hit efforts to reach the 71 million people in desperate need of assistance Nigeria which by Thursday had confirmed 174 infections and 2 deaths from the novel coronavirus has closed its borders and shut down international flights The government says humanitarian assistance will still get in and has pledged to provide those displaced with two months of food rations But aid workers are concerned that the virus could see tighter official controls donor funds going elsewhere and problems bringing in equipment and key personnel like the helicopter pilots who fly to remote locations The military already imposes stringent travel restrictions on aid groups Coupled with insecurity that saw 12 humanitarian workers killed in the region last year the restrictions have left some 12 million people beyond the reach of aid groups The northeast of Nigeria where the big

to help his country fight the coronavirus He announced on Twitter that a letter had been sent to the UN Secretary General urging him to disregard inhuman sic US sanctions on his country Iran is the third hardesthit nation behind China and Italy counting 18663 coronavirus cases and 1213 deaths by 18 March And that only accounts for patients who have been tested and diagnosed not the total number of sick people Although the first case of Covid19 was announced on 19 February its precise origin in Iran remains unknown Some say that Mahan an Iranian airline brought the virus when it repatriated people from China to the Middle East others say it was a businessman who had travelled to China yet others blame Chinese students at a Koranic school in the holy city of Qom Official statistics show that the number of deaths attributed to Covid19 is rising between 8 and 18 March the death rate relative to diagnosed cases more than doubled from 25 to 65 Some officials say those figures are gross

worldwide with governments anxiously trying to chart a path out of the unprecedented global health and economic emergency Debates are raging worldwide over when and how to relax strict lockdowns Many leaders fear triggering another wave of infections but are also worried about the mounting economic costs and signs of social tension The economic impact of the pandemic could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe with the number of people suffering from acute hunger projected to nearly double to 265 million this year the UN is World Food Programme warned We are on the brink of a hunger pandemic WFP director David Beasley told the UN Security Council in a video conference Millions of civilians living in conflictscarred nations including many women and children face being pushed to the brink of starvation with the spectre of famine a very real and dangerous possibility The worstcase scenario could see famine in some three dozen countries he added Freezes on whole sectors of commerce are

criticism for a latenight tweet announcing the US would temporarily halt immigration to the country claiming it would save American jobs some 22 million of which have vanished in the wake of virus shutdowns The vague threat was scant on details but suggested a hardening of his antiimmigration crusade a move likely to delight supporters ahead of November elections In light of the attack from the

March a government strategy that was risky at best As it was no longer possible to contain the spread of the virus rather than impose radical lockdown measures as in Italy Spain and some Asian countries the UK would aim to reduce the peak of infection not suppress it completely so as to build up some kind of herd immunity in the population 1 there would be no home confinement no school closures and no ban on mass gatherings notably football matches The governments expert advisors not knowing exactly what proportion of the population would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity and stop spread of the virus suggested a worstcase scenario of 80 Once herd immunity was achieved the UK could again prosper on the international stage without fear of further outbreaks But Johnson admitted in his announcement that many more families would lose loved ones before their time Up to 500000 people might die 2 Under pressure from the World Health Organisation WHO public opinion and many in the scientific community Johnson eventually modified his policy On 16 March he advised against attending mass gatherings and asked anyone with Covid19 symptoms to selfisolate though without significantly changing his position that the epidemic was inevitable On 23 March after widespread flouting of government requests for physical social distancing and with some London hospitals already at saturation point he finally decided to impose a nationwide lockdown From a scientific viewpoint the UKs initial approach was not unreasonable Rather than seeking to eradicate the epidemic it aimed to control the spread of the virus through the population by concentrating infection among the least vulnerable and asking those most at risk the elderly and those with underlying health conditions to selfisolate for a long period the immunity acquired by those less at risk would then protect the vulnerable Concern about social fatigue Though only the British dared to set it out in such bald terms others have contemplated this approach When Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he expected a large part of the population of the Netherlands would eventually catch the virus he meant the same thing The US effectively took the same approach during the first phase of the epidemic in midMarch when the SARSCoV2 virus which causes the Covid19 disease was already spreading across the US and the majority of cases could no longer be traced to an identifiable source the federal government had adopted only minor or symbolic measures such as banning flights from highrisk countries leaving each state or municipality to manage its own risk Nearly 275 million people in the US have no health insurance and the average cost of a hospital stay is over 4000 per day Frances strategy was not significantly different until tighter social distancing measures were announced on 12 March The British approach however stemmed from a libertarian stance a neoliberal vision of the scheme of things Patrick Vallance former president of RD at pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline GSK and now chief scientific advisor to the government said that in an open world with unequal healthcare systems the coronavirus would inevitably continue to spread and might even become seasonal Though the virus could be totally contained by drastic measures like those used in China it was inconceivable for a country like the UK to tolerate a lockdown lasting more than a few weeks let alone longer lockdowns repeated in consecutive years Vallances statement was based on the concept of social fatigue formulated by the Behavioural Insights Team or Nudge Unit set up by David Cameron in 2014 to introduce behavioural science into government decisionmaking 3 and strengthened by the influence of Boris Johnsons special advisor Dominic Cummings a fervent admirer of behavioural economics Strict lockdown measures would be not only detrimental to the economy but socially intolerable in the long term Vallance believed the victory of Asian countries China Singapore over SARSCoV2 through a travel ban was illusory As soon as those countries were again open which the British experts regarded as essential for a society to flourish new centres of infection would appear requiring further costly lockdown measures indeed China is now importing new cases of Covid19 from Europe 4 The only solution was to allow the virus to spread but to slow its pace Over the last few decades neoliberal globalisation has developed rules and institutions among them the WHO for international coordination on epidemics The WHO advocates a global approach with open management of the spread of the virus it is in favour of locking down cities and regions in countries that are affected but against closing national borders counterproductive because it is not 100 effective and hinders contact tracing and embargos on medical materials which lead to surpluses in countries that are expecting an epidemic and shortages in countries already affected The WHO is the core of a system for managing epidemics in a world made up of supposedly cooperative countries The virus could be contained by drastic measures like those used in China but it was inconceivable for a country like the UK to tolerate a lockdown of more than a few weeks But some western countries have now broken away from the multilateral international system of the 1990s and 2000s A key example is the US it is hard to apply WHO rules to a country like Iran when it is under US sanctions and forced to trade with China to survive and when even its right to humanitarian aid is being challenged 5 Yet allowing this regional power with a population of 81 million to become a hotbed of Covid19 would condemn both Europe and Asia to repeated further outbreaks The virus will inevitably spread The UK doctrine represents a new stage in the neoliberal approach to epidemics Developed between 2010 and 2017 on the basis of several Department of Health and Social Care and National Health Service NHS reports it is backed by researchers in medicine and epidemiology social psychologists and behavioural scientists on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee From studies of the major influenza pandemics of the 20th century it concludes that the UKs economic links with the rest of the world make it impossible to contain a pandemic Modern mass global transit also affords opportunities for the virus to be rapidly spread across the world This means that it almost certainly will not be possible to contain or eradicate a new virus in its country of origin or on arrival in the UK The expectation must be that the virus will inevitably spread and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success and cannot be relied on as a way to buy time 6 This means the government has no choice but to allow the virus to spread through the population while trying to flatten the infection peak and ensure effective communication to avoid panic This policy allows the UK to quickly resume its place on the international stage but forces its partners to accept the spread of the virus Unsurprisingly the WHO and European Union are highly critical 7 But the UK strategy did not come out of the blue it is a result of the development of radically individualist health doctrines within the ideological corpus of rightwing governments especially in the UK and US Many commentators note how over the last decade the ideological centre of gravity of the UK Conservative party has gradually shifted from the centreright towards the position of the radical right thinktanks often eurosceptic climatesceptic and libertarian that have been based in Tufton Street Westminster since the Thatcher era Well before the coronavirus crisis because of the resurgence of measles epidemics in the UK these institutions warned that the herd immunity achieved with optional vaccination against childhood diseases had been lost and felt the government should do more to encourage vaccination but argued that making it compulsory was not the answer 8 Some proposed the use of market mechanisms the Adam Smith Institute suggested that parents be paid to have their children vaccinated in the name of internalising externalities that society should offer financial payment for the health benefits that it draws from the individual behaviour of vaccination 9 UK government finally backed down During the epidemics Chinese phase many neoliberal journalists looked forward to the crisis demonstrating the superiority of western neoliberalism to Chinese authoritarianism In February France Culture journalist Brice Couturier saw it as Xi Jinpings Chernobyl which would discredit the Chinese Communist Party as Chernobyl had discredited the Soviet Union 10 These commentators saw the crisis as an opportunity for a fullscale experiment in economics The control group China Hong Kong and Singapore would use the classic stateled solutions of compulsory confinement and internal and external travel bans until the virus was eradicated from their territories the treatment group western countries especially the UK would adopt solutions based on stateorganised laissezfaire without closures or lockdowns based on channelling infection towards the least vulnerable groups At the end of the experiment these two models would be assessed in terms of deaths bankruptcies and percentage points lost from GDP a natural experiment with an exorbitant price of hundreds of thousands of lives It will take more than a couple of weeks to exit from neoliberalism and the emergency production of medical services and food necessary for survival must rely on the economic infrastructure established over the last 40 years The UK government finally backed down Responses to the crisis are subject to the limits of the production structure Over the last four decades European businesses have pursued zeroinventory management and justintime production in order to gain a few points of return on capital and maximise shareholder value now they face a collapse of supply chains Governments forced into fiscal competition have cut back on spending Public services and hospital beds have been optimised as have strategic inventories France faced the start of the pandemic on its territory with zero stock of FFP2 face masks Are countries that experienced the shift to neoliberalism in the 1980s economically capable of organising a lockdown on Chinese or Singaporean lines There was some surprise when French president Emmanuel Macron talked simultaneously on March 12 about defending societys most vulnerable and supporting businesses But the fact remains it will take more than a couple of weeks to exit from neoliberalism and the emergency production of medical services and food necessary for survival must rely on the economic infrastructure established over the last 40 years The huge suffering caused by this pandemic is also stirring rebellious feelings The hundreds of thousands of deaths the epidemiologists expect and the loss of many loved ones as in Johnsons warning could lead to serious unrest The epidemic caused major protests in China with a surge in online political debate barricaded roads in Hubei province and Hong Kong residents protesting against mainland Chinese nationals moving into their territory Just as free trade created huge social tensions in the UK in the 19th century 11 the perception that Covid19 is spreading uncontrolled makes people very anxious Surveys show public opinion is pressuring governments to adopt stricter social distancing measures not the reverse A recent survey in the UK showed 41 of people felt the government was not taking strong enough action while only 12 felt it was 12 In France social distancing measures such as school closures have huge public support and the least well received of the 12 March measures was the decision to keep public transport running If the new health strategies outlined in this article were implemented we could expect popular reaction on a scale reflecting the sufferings endured Governments should not be given more latitude than they already have been In this crisis they are caught up in the conflict between the production structures of their country and the sufferings caused by the pandemic We are not seeing political choices but an approach to dealing with extreme events in the late phase of neoliberalism that is just beginning The UK strategy on Covid19 was only a strategy under pressure from public opinion the Johnson government retreated Strategies may not be infallible but neither are they mere fantasies they reveal how a regimes thinkers look for solutions to save the regime from its contradictions and crises though without asking if a regime that calls for inhuman solutions is worth saving 1 Coronavirus science chief

the ongoing Covid19 pandemic as experts indicate the continent is most populous country needs to take a number of major steps in order to increase the supply of food Buhari addressed farmers calling on them to improve production We do not have money to import so we must produce what we have to eat Part of the solution includes moving investments towards agriculture and away from petroleum products Money that could have bolstered Nigerian agriculture had been spent on food imports Nigeria produces 60000 metric tons of wheat per year while the annual demand for wheat totals at 47 million metric tons leaving a considerable deficit Buhari is calls for farmers to provide for Nigeria is not new according to Nnamdi Obasi senior adviser on Nigeria for the International Crisis Group ICG Buhari has made some effort to ban the use of foreign exchange to import items including rice in order to boost local production In August 2019 he directed the central bank to block food importers and requests for foreign currency because of reports that food was being smuggled in across the borders from neighbouring countries says Obasi The borders were locked down too which was reinforced by the recent Covid19 restrictions The oil price crashing the fall in export revenues and the very significant cuts in the budget for 2020 have added extra urgency to that policy so it certainly deserves more attention now than ever before he adds Covid19 restrictions Food supply was exempted from most restrictions during the height of the lockdown in Nigeria but it was still indirectly affected by falling consumer incomes and other shocks according to a report out by International Food Policy Research Institute IFPRI coauthored by Kwaw Andam director of the Nigeria Strategy Support Program The Nigeria Impacts of COVID19 on Production Poverty Food Systems report out this month also indicates that Nigeria lost 12 billion euros in the agriculture sector over the 5week lockdown period The restricted movement plan took place at the start of the planting season so this obviously affected agriculture says Abujabased Andam On interstate passenger travel the lockdown had some implications in terms of labor availability for farmers and how easily they can trade their food he adds Forty percent of Nigerians live below poverty line statistics office Buhari sets 4 May date for lifting Nigeria is coronavirus lockdown The IFPRI report projections indicate that millions of Nigerians will fall into poverty for a short period as a result of Covid19 Higher income and urban households experience larger income losses as lockdowns target cities and the nonpoor are more likely to work in manufacturing and services according to the report But incomes of rural and lowerincome households will also fall mainly due to effects of food system disruptions on smallholder farmer incomes and the closure of urban informal markets where urban poor often work it added VIolence in the north Concerted efforts to improve agriculture production will require discussion about dealing with the ongoing violence in the northern part of the country says ICG is Obasi It is a major issue now as far as feeding the country is concerned because the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast has been a major setback to agriculture in parts of the region whether we talk about crop production or livestock production says Obasi author of the ICG report Violence in Nigeria is Northwest Rolling Back the Mayhem The violence has killed over 8000 people since 2011 and displaced over 200000 some into neighbouring Niger Hausa farmers and Fulani herders competing for the same resourcesland and waterhave been at the core of interethnic violence in the area Those issues in addition to the presence of Boko Haram separatists jihadist advancements in the region and spill over from Niger has created a dangerous and volatile area The conflicts have also affected agriculture in the northcentral regions the middle belt and now in the northwest and I must say it is not only farmers that are affected but herders too In many cases they have lost huge amounts of livestock sometimes by cattle rustling says Obasi And without improving security it will not be possible to ramp up farming in the northwest I think everybody is quite clear about that he adds The government will need to work on a system of reforming the livestock production but also the crop production order to ensure that they are no longer conflictual he tells RFI Some programmes have already been put in place such as the National Livestock Transformation Plan NLTP part of a government solution to quell farmerherder clashes in the region The plan includes investment conflict resolution law and order humanitarian relief and education Obasi contends that the NLTP is the best solution so far also citing state governments that are creating grazing reserves for herders which would also provide for social amenities and some infrastructure That would reduce the friction between herders and farmers long term implementing the national livestock transformation plan over the 10year period for which it is planned It then produces a more stable environment for both livestock and farm production crop production and minimises the violence he says An increase in dialogue between the Hausa and Fulani communities at a local level not only at state level will also improve the situation says Obasi Part of the solution would be to earmark funds if the violence is quelled for the return of the 200000 displaced people for resettlement and livelihood recovery if there are funds to be had While some investment has been put forward it is not enough The country is facing a national emergency and it needs to respond with a sense of urgency to that emergency he adds Policy changes needed Shortterm solutions are viable according to IFPRI is Andam starting with the restrictions on food markets While a number of other countries are allowing food markets to operate with longer hours in the hopes that a flow of people will prevent the spread of the disease Nigeria operates on the opposite principle Here in Abuja until recently the market was allowed to open only two days a week now they have expanded it to three and this is the same across most places in Nigeria says Andam Allowing food markets to operate for longer hours and for food to be sold in several locations not just the market would help farmers he says Increasing farming efficiency in order to make better use of arable land to produce more per hectare which has not been done in the past says ICG is Obasi Ramping up productivity could include what seed varieties are used like the rice sector which demands a lot of improvement And secondly infrastructure roads getting access to markets that would help to inch towards getting more benefits for Nigerian farmers says Andam Nigeria does have a lot of what is required labor pool a large share of the population being young the irrigation potential land the market in terms of consumers he says What would make this aspiration come to pass would be to put in place the right policies to stimulate agricultural activity he adds More videos available on Radio France Internationale All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved

coronavirus near residential buildings in Mumbai on July 16 2020 India crossed 1 million coronavirus cases on Friday third only to the United States and Brazil prompting concerns about its readiness to confront an inevitable surge that could overwhelm hospitals and test the countrys feeble health care system A surge of 34956 new cases in the past 24 hours took the national total to 1003832 The Health Ministry also reported a record number of 687 deaths for a total of 25602 It said 635757 people have recovered and the recovery rate was continuing to improve at 63 The grim milestone comes at a time when several Indian states are imposing focused lockdowns to stem the outbreak amid frantic efforts by local governments to protect the economy So far three states Maharashtra Delhi and Tamil Nadu have accounted for more than half of total cases But in Indias vast countryside which is much less prepared and with weaker health care the pandemic is clearly growing The acceleration in cases remains the main challenge for India in the coming days said Dr Ashish Jha director of the Harvard Global Health Institute adding that a vast majority of cases were still being missed The continuing surge has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states In Bangalore a city that prides itself as the center of of Indian technology innovation the government ordered a weeklong lockdown that began Tuesday evening after the cases surged exponentially In Bihar an eastern state with a population of 128 million and a fragile health system a twoweek lockdown was announced Thursday In Uttar Pradesh the most populous state with more than 200 million people authorities have started placing residents under strict weekend curfews which will remain in place until the end of the month Other local governments are increasingly focusing on smaller lockdowns that shield the economy Nearly a dozen states have imposed restrictions on containment zones areas that can be as small as a few houses or a street Dr Anant Bhan a global health researcher said that India was likely to see a series of peaks as the infection spread in rural areas He pointed out that the capital of New Delhi and the financial capital Mumbai had already seen surges while infections have now shifted to smaller cities Indias response to the virus was initially sluggish and then it bought time by locking down its entire population of 14 billion people when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown for three weeks on March 24 If the situation is not handled in these 21 days the country and your family could go back 21 years Modi said then in a televised address to Indians many of whom were still unaware of the scale of the crisis in the country The nationwide lockdown then extended for five more weeks came at an enormous economic cost amid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis when millions of impoverished migrant workers were forced to return to the countryside due to job losses and hunger Aimed at increasing the capacity of the health care system the lockdown slowed down the virus but it wasnt enough Cases kept increasing while testing still remained abysmally low and the virus rocketed through Indias vast landscape from high up in the Himalayan Kashmir to the sprawling beaches of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu Slowdown isnt eradication said Jayaprakash Muliyil an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore Muliyil said that India had to try and slow down the virus because it didnt have enough beds but was only partly successful since the requirement was quite large Indias public health care system is one of the most chronically underfunded in the world and access to hospitals in rural areas is very low Experts say the challenge for India will be to tightrope the opening up of the economy while trying to restrict the increase in cases to manageable levels that dont overwhelm hospitals Indias strategy going forward will revolve around containment zones said Rajesh Bhushan of Indias federal Health Ministry Once more zones are mapped out health care workers will go from house to house and test those with symptoms he said Dr Ujjwal Parakh a senior consultant at the department of respiratory medicine at Ganga Ram Hospital New Delhi said authorities could have been more transparent about testing guidelines Initially India had some of the worlds most stringent testing criteria and used only about a third of its testing capacity After months of sluggishness it has now ramped up testing from a single lab in January to over 1200 Over 300000 samples are being tested every day In some cities it has also allowed tests without a doctors prescription The battle plan is to do all the things we know work Open the economy

most forwardthinking elements of Spain response to COVID19 was the decision to empty immigration detention centres Spain has one of the highest death tolls in the world and the country has recorded over 200000 confirmed cases On 14 March the Spanish government declared a state of emergency and the population was ordered inside Within a month most of Spain immigration detention centres were empty and at the time of writing the immigrant detainee population on the Spanish mainland stood at just three The Spanish authorities have not suddenly had a change of heart regarding the use of detention but rather recognised what activists have been saying all along ealth and legal issues make the system untenable With poor sanitary conditions and the inability to socially distance immigration detention centres are perfect virus incubators The risk to detainees staff and the wider public is obvious Spanish judges also made the case that police resources would be far better deployed on the streets to enforce the lockdown now in its sixth week Equally detention now has no legal basis Detention centres are for use as temporary holding facilities prior to deportation Spain sets a maximum limit of sixty days for a person to be held The EU Returns Directive stipulates that detainees must be released if reasonable prospect of removal no longer existsue to the nearworldwide shutdown of borders and air travel returns are not possible Therefore immigration detention centres can no longer fulfil their purpose Magda MajkowskaTomkin Migration and Inclusion Unit of the Open Society Foundationsnitiative for Europe Now is the time to pivot away from the practice As Spanish detention centres were closed detainees who could stay with friends or family were released first Those without were offered the choice to stay in open reception centres run by NGOs with established experience of the rights and needs of migrants Though the interior ministry is ultimately responsible for immigration matters the closures was notable because it was borne out of collaboration between local and regional authorities cooperating with civil society organisations the Ombudsman detention centre directors and judges to ensure that the rights and dignity of migrants were respected The truth is migrants with positive experiences of the immigration system are more inclined to engage with it The process makes clear that a communityfocused approach to hosting migrants can provide a pathway towards integration and is far more productive than confinement In the years following Europe refugee crisis we have seen the continent tighten borders dilute asylum systems and punish migrationorientated civil society groups The European Commission is drafting a new pact on migration and asylum that will likely place securitisation of borders over humanitarian and legal concerns with detention being increased and lengthened Though the backdrop is tragic the pandemic sets the scene for these plans to be challenged The Council of Europe has called for the pact to be underpinned by human rights effective solidarity and responsibility sharing Detention has been suspended in Spain with no immediate negative consequences Could it be that we never needed it Partial and largescale releases have also been seen in the Netherlands Indonesia France Peru Thailand the United Kingdom and the United States but many countries are still yet to act Greece and Italy two of the main embarkation points for migrants arriving in Europe are egregious examples The Greek islands are host to squalid dangerous and vastly overcrowded centres where families live in fear and desperation Thankfully no confirmed cases of coronavirus have yet emerged from Moria Europe largest refugee camp but medical NGO Méecins Sans Frontièes has referred to it as a time bomb Magda MajkowskaTomkin Migration and Inclusion Unit of the Open Society Foundationsnitiative for Europe It is encouraging that the Spanish authorities have conceded the obvious health and legal issues surrounding immigration detention This should not be a oneoff Deportations are rarely a quick process and this often means migrants are locked up for a significant stretch of time in dismal conditions at great cost to the taxpayer There is still work to do Migrants still languish in essentially closed facilities in Spain two North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla A thousand NGOs have launched a campaign for them to be released and for all undocumented migrants to be regularised as neighbouring Portugal albeit temporarily has done and Italy is considering More than 30000 migrants entered Spain by land and sea routes in 2019 and although movement has temporarily slowed due to the pandemic the push factors of conflict and poverty do not abate Spain has shown that within a matter of weeks almost all of nation detention system can be closed due to health risks human rights concerns and legal uncertainty We must

news during the Covid19 period according to a number of media watchdogs and journalist associations that have been tracking abuse of reporters According to Austriabased International Press Institute IPI which is tracking media freedom 104 violations have been noted worldwide including 22 on the African continent Verbal and physical attacks like the NTV journalist make up the majority of violations Among the violations cited was an unnamed freelance journalist halted by police in Harare en route to report on the Covid19 lockdown Reporter claims he was forced to lie down and beaten by officers who released him 15 minutes later according to the IPI report Frenchbased watchdog group Reporters Without Borders RSF notes that Zimbabwe is currently Africa is biggest press freedom violator in connection with Coronavirus crisis with no fewer than five arrests of journalists over the past two weeks Arresting journalists does not stop the epidemic These press freedom violations also run counter to government directives authorizing journalists to work during the lockdown and to use their 2019 press cards of which the validity has been extended said Arnaud Froger head of RSF is Africa desk Part of the issue in Zimbabwe according to RSF stems from police not giving journalists accurate information and clear instructions so they can go out and do their work Kenya police intimidation The government in Kenya has encumbered journalism freedom of expression and the right to information says Demas Kiprono a lawyer columnist and Amnesty International legal expert Kenyan police use violence as a tactic to intimidate journalists from covering the news Kiprono tells RFI referencing a 27 March video of an NTV television journalist in Mombasa It depicted a police officer assaulting an NTV journalist with impunity Because of public outrage the government said that it had interdicted the officer although his name was never published says Kiprono Media watchdogs acknowledge that some restrictive measures are necessary to protect citizens and journalists during the Covid19 pandemic but the scale of these measures is disproportionate Many governments seem to be using the Coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to further entrench repressive measures and far overreach the limits in place under international human rights laws on their powers during such times

preventative Covid19 measures as a reason to detain journalists The Somali Journalists Syndicate SJS noted that journalists both in Mogadishu the capital and Hargeisa the capital of selfproclaimed Somaliland were intimidated threatened and two were briefly detained while trying to cover Covid19 stories However SJS said that it welcomed the announcement of Somali Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire on Monday that journalists will be able to work and operate during the curfew imposed by the police chief General Abdi Hassan Mohamed because media is considered an essential service Journalists in prison Other reporter groups have called on governments to release journalists who have been detained or convicted and are currently in prison Standard preventative measures put in place to prevent the spread of highly contagious Covid19 include washing hands regularly and remaining two metres from others measures which are difficult in prisons where space is at a premium and good hygiene is not a given But on Monday Cameroonian CNews TV channel cameraman Eric Kouatchou was released after being detained by authorities since 2 April Kouatchou who lives in Paris returned to Douala and was in selfconfinement as he had come from Europe He was accused by Cameroonian authorities of contempt of the fatherland for allegedly giving his press card to a Cameroonian activist in Paris last February The government said this activist went to the French Agricultural Fair in Paris to call on France to do something about the killings taking place in Anglophone Cameroon We are satisfied and perhaps even relieved because we were worried about him Denis Nkwebo the president of the Cameroon National Journalists Union SNJ told RFI The Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ has called on governments to free journalists already convicted on humanitarian grounds so they do not become ill from Covid19 In order to prevent the curtailing of freedom of the press governments across the African continent

is therefore drowned in a swamp of rumours meaning that the public is not adequately and accurately informed on how best to protect themselves and others and what is being done by the government to

presentation of its new Pact on Asylum and Migration for another several months due to the coronavirus crisis The pact seeks to ensure legal immigration to the European Union EU strengthen external borders reform asylum readmission and return rules and promote integration It also seeks to step up the fight against human traffickers and smugglers Ylva Johansson the current European Commissioner for Home Affairs has been overseeing the drafting process The 56yearold Swedish politician a member of the Social Democratic Party took up her post as commissioner in 2019 She spoke with La Croixs EU correspondent in Brussels Céline Schoen about how the COVID19 crisis has affected Europes efforts to more effectively manage migration issues La Croix The pandemic has brought about unprecedented financial solidarity among EU member states Could such solidarity also be expressed for the common management of migration an issue that has seriously divided the EU since 2005 Ylva Johansson A lot of people ask me if it will be more difficult to find an agreement on asylum and migration because of COVID19 My answer is no But will it be easier to shape solidarity on this issue after this crisis I do not think so either Migration issues are so thorny and difficult Many people in the various European capitals have asked me to be patient until the current budget talks are concluded I have therefore decided to wait for a preliminary agreement on the recovery plan and the multiannual financial framework 20212027 to be reached in the Council before proposing a new Pact on Asylum and Migration With a little luck this pact could be put on the table as early as July However it will probably have to wait until September Do you think immigration is necessary for Europe Europe needs labor because the continent is ageing And in many countries some sectors of employment are depopulated Every year more than two million migrants arrive in the EU legally This is working very well and I would like to see this share increase Fewer and fewer people are arriving illegally Last year there were 170000 Five years after the crisis of 2015 what is your assessment of the integration of the migrants who came to Europe that year as refugees Many have integrated very well We saw it during the COVID19 crisis many essential workers came from immigrant families or are migrants themselves But there is still a lot to be done Integration is the responsibility of the States but at the European level we are there to help In fact we have launched consultations with a view to developing a new integration strategy What are the keys to successful integration The most important thing is to be active on the labor market to have children in school and to be able to earn one is own money and be part of society as quickly as possible Integration is more likely to be experienced at the local or regional level one never integrates into a country one integrates into communities Churches or NGOs often help with this What role do churches play in migration They do a lot to support refugees and help them integrate Their representatives have a lot of experience Churches are societies as such always on the move They often know better than anyone else what does not work According to a study by the Erasmus University in Rotterdam more than half of the Syrian refugees in Germany eventually want to return to their home country Can the EU facilitate remigration Society can facilitate integration but you have to be willing to integrate It takes two to tango Indeed some people will prefer to return We can facilitate returns by ensuring reintegration in the countries of origin In my proposal a lot of attention will be paid to returns and cooperation with third countries more than in the 2016 proposal which was made in the context of the refugee crisis It should be added that today the majority of those arriving illegally will not be granted asylum because they do not need international protection Can illegal immigration in Europe be converted 100 into legal immigration I prefer to talk about irregular migration But no I do not think it can become 100 legal Everyone should always have the right to seek asylum somewhere It is a fundamental individual right On the other hand it is crucial to open as many legal migration channels as possible so that no one is dependent on smugglers We need to build better partnerships with third countries for people who want to come to work in the EU We need to avoid brain drain and seek a winwin situation For refugees we also need legal channels notably through resettlement agreements and humanitarian admissions In 2016 the EU signed an agreement with Turkey to retain in its territory Syrian refugees in particular Do you find this satisfactory Turkey is the country that hosts the largest refugee community in the world Four million Syrians live in Turkey To be fair the EU must show solidarity with them We are helping Turkey by supporting schools paying teachers and financing health centers That is also what European solidarity is all about There are 80 million displaced persons in the world not all migrants and refugees can come to the EU But we have a moral obligation to help them wherever they are There are press and NGO reports of cases of migrants being sent back from Malta to Libya Yet the United Nations insists that Libya is not a safe third country What is the Commission is view on this I am concerned about these reports The principle of nonrefoulement ie that no one should be re turned to a country where they would face irreparable harm is crucial It is up to the countries to investigate to find out exactly what is happening For Malta the situation is complicated with many migrants on a very small island It is also to show more solidarity with countries like Malta that we need a new pact With the Libyan coastguard we are cooperating on training with respect for human rights But it is not an easy task It is difficult to have real cooperation We would like to find an effective way forward with that country In November 2019 the EU decided to increase the permanent staff of Frontex the agency responsible for external border control from 1500 to 10000 officers in 2027 Are we on the right track It depends on the budget Some member States would like to reduce the budget The question of funding will have to be arbitrated in the ongoing budget negotiations Interview done in collaboration with Avvenire and Nederlands Dagblad Link to Image

COVID19 these sanctions were recognised by Human Rights Watch as undermining access to healthcare The virus has taken lives globally but in Iran it has been particularly shocking with hospital beds in parking lots and mass graves visible from space Hundreds of lives have been lost because of the sanctions Trump calls the highest sanctions ever sanctions that not only mean it is often impossible to get basic medicines but that a Coronavirus app launched by the Iranian government to assist vulnerable citizens was recently pulled by Google from its app store As the world turns its back on Iran during its time of need this indifference will define how a generation of Iranians views the West But this isnt about politics Even hawkish George W Bush eased sanctions on Iran at times of humanitarian crisis This crisis is truly borderless Turkey is only one country between Iran and the European Union But the WHOs message to adhere to basic morality has fallen on deaf ears in Washington DC The countrys authorities have even struggled to import coronavirus testing kits something that harms not only Iran but the global population The Trump administration claims that humanitarian and medical needs are exempt from sanctions This may be true in theory but in practice few companies dare trade with Iran and those who do find that transactions take triple the normal time And time is a luxury we do not have when fighting a pandemic Iranian president Hassan Rouhani recently wrote to world leaders exhorting them to ignore US sanctions and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif did the same to UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres describing the sanctions as a campaign of economic terrorism Increasingly US and UK political figures have started to see sense and echo their Iranian counterparts US congresswoman Ilhan Omar as well as Ali Milani the Labour candidate who stood against prime minister Boris Johnson in his Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency have supported the calls to put humanitarianism before posturing The pandemic has had a high personal cost for Milani whose father has died after contracting the virus in Iran After China and Italy Iran has seen the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID19 making it the disease epicentre of the Middle East And it is not just a shortage of medication that the country is battling because of sanctions Even basic equipment like face masks and protective suits are in short supply leading to doctors becoming infected and being relieved of duty exactly the opposite of what needs to happen if we are to get this pandemic under control It should not be difficult for Washington to adjust its position particularly since the logic of the sanctions is at best spurious and at worst nonexistent The measures were reintroduced after the US unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear treaty with Iran despite all the other signatories including the UK France Germany Russia and China urging the US to continue to honour its commitments Unsurprisingly international pressure is building on Trump UN Special Rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures Idris Jazairy has called the sanctions illegitimate disproportionate and indiscriminate He added The current system creates doubt and ambiguity which makes it all but impossible for Iran to import these urgently needed humanitarian goods This ambiguity causes a chilling effect which is likely to lead to silent deaths in hospitals as medicines run out while the international media fail to notice In a bid to deflect international criticism the US last week announced an easing of sanctions through an arrangement with Switzerland by which the European country would facilitate payment for exports of goods permitted under the sanctions Critics however immediately dismissed the move as a PR stunt since it was incapable of channelling the large money flows needed to bring enough essential items into the country Shadowy lobbying groups continue to influence Trump to force all pharmaceutical companies to end their business with Iran even that which is carried out under the special licence humanitarian exemptions allowed by the US sanctions regime One of those United Against Nuclear Iran is continuing to seek to impose reputational damage on companies dealing with Iran in pursuit of its aim of pressuring Tehran to withdraw from its regional superpower status None of this is wise at the best of times but certainly not during a global pandemic Any failure to contain the virus inside Iran will adversely impact the global effort against the COVID19 To continue with the current policy is to conduct a premeditated massacre a massacre that will affect all of us around the world Iranian pharmacology professor Esfandyar Batmanghelidj recently stated that Just as a virus will attack the most vulnerable members of any given population the coronavirus is now attacking the global health system at its most vulnerable points before spreading everywhere else Our system may not be as vulnerable as Irans but we are part of the same global organism And COVID19 is continuing to spread

only food she has a can of powdered milk scrounged from a rubbish bin But what to do after that the young mother asks as she cradles her baby in the ramshackle home she shares with a dozen others on the outskirts of Tirana For Mirela and hundreds of thousands of other Roma living in slums across the Western Balkans the first symptom of the coronavirus pandemic has been hunger Curfews and other lockdown measures have wiped out income for families who live handtomouth often by selling scraps of plastic and metal scavenged from bins Now that business is on hold piles of waste are festering in Mirela is neighbourhood shrouding it in a putrid odour Everything is blocked we do not have anywhere to sell the recyclables and for food we also have to go through the garbage to find something to eat like pasta and rice said 15yearold Vanesa Lika another teenage mother living in the shantytown in Breglumas The community of around 40 Roma are still going out daily to collect bottles and cans in hopes that business will soon resume even though they fear contamination from rummaging through other people is waste We know that the bottles can carry the virus but there is nothing we can do said Mirela is motherinlaw Lindita Vogli Poverty forces you to try everything Exposed While the virus infects rich and poor alike its deadly march has exposed the globe is inequities revealing how safety measures like social distancing regular handwashing and teleworking are privileges only some can enjoy In the Balkans a long history of discrimination has spun Roma and other minorities into cycles of poverty making them especially vulnerable to the virus and its economic shock With education gaps and prejudice closing off many job opportunities the vast majority of Roma work informally in waste sorting as day labourers or in brass bands in the street Over the past month these grey zone jobs and meagre wages have vanished In Suto Orizari one of the region is largest Roma neighbourhoods outside the North Macedonia capital Skopje the normally bustling market of cheap clothes and goods that sustains the community has gone dark These people are at both health and humanitarian risk said Dragan Gracanin who leads an organisation for coordinating Roma initiatives in Serbia If they are hungry they will be forced to get out and work and therefore be exposed to infection No water The virus has killed more than 250 people and infected nearly 10000 in the Western Balkans one of Europe is poorest regions Although there are no reliable statistics the World Bank estimates Roma could make up between 700000 and 13 million of the region is population While responses to the virus have varied by country in some places it has taken weeks for emergency food and hygienic aid to arrive in desperate Roma communities For the very poorest even the most basic precautions such as handwashing can be a struggle We look in the garbage bins for cans or bottles of soap and we fill them with water to wash our hands Lika told AFP as she tried to calm a coughing baby Less than half of Roma in Albania have piped water at home according to a UN survey In Serbia one of the more developed countries in the Balkans more than 5300 Roma families have reported a lack of access to clean drinking water while two thirds of homes are not connected to a sewerage system Faced with coronavirus concerns local authorities in Serbia have only recently organised the installation of water tanks in the worstoff neighbourhoods after urgent calls from activists Bread and yoghurt Many Roma communities are also cramped and crowded making social distancing all but impossible How can someone selfisolate if he is squatting in a tworoom shack with 12 other members of his family asked Bashkim Ibishi who leads the NGO Advancing Together which works with Roma and other marginalised groups in Kosovo Outside Montenegro is capital Podgorica one Roma father of 10 recently tested positive for COVID19 and was taken to hospital Police are now guarding the community around the clock while hundreds of families inside are subsisting on a daily ration of two loaves of bread and two litres of yoghurt provided by the Red Cross They have also received some other aid packages of flour canned food cabbage and hygiene products all of which are thinly spread across large families I am grateful for any aid but two loaves of bread and two litres of yoghurt is not enough said Sahu Sefani a 41yearold father of seven Like most of his neighbours Sefani used to eke out a living by reselling recyclables or other goods picked out from the city is garbage Robbed of that income debts have piled up with some families unable to pay water and electricity bills until the state recently stepped in For now the most pressing need is hunger But should the virus extend its reach there is concern about how a lifetime of deprivation plus barriers to medical care have weakened the overall health and immunity of those on society is bottom rung If you do not have sufficient means to provide for your family it means less vitamins less everything on the kitchen table said Ibishi And this makes you more vulnerable bursssmkjm

this year Hotez the codirector of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children is Hospital and Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston testified before the US House Committee on Science His team is vaccine had been created in response to the SARS outbreak over a decade earlier We had the vaccine ready to goHotez told the committee But by then nobody was interested in a coronavirus vaccine wenty years have passed since the outbreak of SARS yet the pharmaceutical industries have not considered infectious diseases a matter of priority because they are not as profitable as chronic diseasesassimo Florio professor of public economics at the University of Milan told Euronews Analysis by Bloomberg intelligence has shown that the world is 20 largest pharmaceutical companies operated around 400 new research projects over the past year Roughly half were devoted to tackling cancer while only 65 dealt with infectious diseases Of those 20 big firms only four had special vaccine units The current research system is the victim of an incurable contradiction between the priority of science for health and that of science for profitProfessor Florio

stay in the public domain his is a powerful statementelgian Green Party MEP Petra De Sutter told Euronews he idea that the market solves everything is fake In a time of crisis governments have to face the issue Before the resolution was voted she was one of the signatories to a letter from a crossparty group to the European Commission demanding urgent action to ensure the economic affordability of any COVID19 vaccine funded by the European Union The letter expressed alarm that no such provision had been included in publiclyfunded research projects he pharmaceutical one is not like a common industry It not about buying a new television set Consumers have no choice when they are ill and in need of a specific druge Sutter explained ight now it the market that sets the agenda on the development of new drugs Yet the market would never invest in something that doesn appear to be profitable Moreover some highly expensive drugs are developed also thanks to public funding For this reason we need to rethink a Europeanled research on health and drugs in accordance with people needse Sutter said Belgian Green Party MEP Petra De Sutter Global project to ensure access to COVID19 medical products According to the World Health Organization 62 research programmes are currently underway in laboratories around the world to find a vaccine for COVID19 Recently Costa Rica asked the WHO to create a voluntary pool to collect patent rights data and other information so as to widen access to medical products for combating the coronavirus In response the world health body launched a global project named ccess to COVID19 Tools Acceleratoro ensure worldwide access to resources although the extent to which the project will include a pool to collect patent rights remains unclear In Europe although there is a European Patent Office hose monopoly patents generally last 20 years ach country independently negotiates the cost of a drug with the pharmaceutical industry In Germany the Protection against Infection Act has been recently amended to give the Federal Health Ministry additional powers ncluding the competence to order limitations on patents hen the Bundestag finds there is an epidemic situation of national significance Outside the EU Canada has amended its laws amid the COVID19 emergency to gain easier access to compulsory licenses a mechanism which enables governments to pay a set fee for an intellectual property without seeking the rights holder consent In the past some developing countries used similar strategies to treat their citizens In 1997 South Africa passed a Medicines Act to obtain patented HIV lifesaving medicines from countries where they were sold more cheaply At the time some of the world largest pharmaceutical companies took the South

fibrosis available to all patients While today the deadlock has been resolved at the time the NHS said it couldn afford the high prices of the new drug to make it available As a result some parents of

NHS rationed it so that the drug was immediately available only to the sickest patients others were forced to wait for months and years to access the treatmentcDonald explained The entire system has to change his must not happen againimon Brasch a Just Treatment leader and a former hepatitis C patient told Euronews clearly remember I went through a medical examination to learn whether or not I could access the treatment The doctor told me my liver hadn deteriorated enough so I had to wait I couldn believe it I said to myself maybe I should drink a couple of vodkas every night till my liver gets worse so that finally I could be treated inally I accessed the medicine but what about the next expensive drug that won be available in the future It the entire system of the pharmaceutical market that has to changerasch said Simon Brasch Doctors Without Borders has also signed the letter to the UK government Since 1999 when the NGO won the Nobel Peace Prize it has been fighting for the

per child hile the Humanitarian Mechanismas been useful in protecting children in crisis countries at all income levels continue to struggle to access the pneumonia vaccine at an affordable pricehe NGO said on a statement pproximately onethird of countries globally have not been able to include the pneumonia vaccine in their standard vaccination package due to the exorbitant price charged by

went on to say According to a WHO report in 2017 more than 800000 children under five died due to pneumonia accounting for 15 of all deaths of children in that age group An opportunity to rethink the rules he emergency we are experiencing must be an opportunity to rethink the rules that have defined the pharmaceutical market in recent decadesays Professor Massimo Florio of the University of Milan Various surveys have shown that in recent years pharmaceutical companies tend to invest only in the final stages of research when the profit appears assured while the initial steps are carried out thanks to the resources of universities or associations his pandemic highlights the failure of the current pharmaceutical market For this we need a European public structure that produces the drugs that the private sector does not care about or that exist on the market only at exorbitant pricesrofessor Florio says oday we can believe that developed countries like ours woke up without a vaccine

a raging coronavirus death toll His prediction has proved horribly wrong and highlights the inconsistencies populist leaders who have exploited religion now face Easter Passover and the start of Ramadan all fall in April this year a coincidence that in normal times would see millions of followers of the world is major monotheist religions come together in congregational prayers or family gatherings But the coronavirus pandemic has physically atomised the faithful with lockdown measures sparking unprecedented scenes of clergymen conducting Holy Week services in empty churches and cathedrals across the world Inside the fireravaged Notre Dame cathedral Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit joined a small group of priests for a Good Friday service minus a congregation commemorating one of Christianity is holiest days as well as the first anniversary of the inferno that ravaged the Gothic landmark In a haunting sight inside the Old City in occupied East Jerusalem on Friday a handful of Franciscan friars in dark robes and face masks walked through deserted streets under the pelting rain along the Via Dolorosa believed to be the path Jesus took to his crucifixion Saudi Arabia has already suspended the yearround umrah pilgrimage and has asked Muslims to delay their travel bookings to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the annual Haj in July and August amid questions over whether the world is largest religious gathering can go ahead on schedule There is no doubt however that the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which begins around April 23 will be very different this year with the faithful unable to gather together for the iftar evening meal ending the day is fasting Earlier this week Jews across the world celebrated Passover with Zoom Seders instead of the traditional family gathering of generations around tables Israeli authorities tightened the existing lockdown measures with a special nighttime curfew on Wednesday to dissuade visits and gatherings Joining grandma and grandpa for a Seder Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett warned in a stark prePassover message could kill them The deadly Covid19 virus has killed more than 100000 people across the world and it is attacking what French sociologist Emile Durkheim identified as the fundamental purpose of religion the social phenomenon of drawing communities together in rites and ritual observances It is also exposing the fault lines between religious faith and science as well as tensions between spiritual and secular powers The infectiousness of the disease has undermined the congregational nature of religious practices while the failures by some religious groups to follow social distancing has exacerbated the targeting and stereotyping of religious followers For populist leaders who have exploited religion to rise to power or maintain their political positions the crisis could threaten the foundations of their religious support base as well as their discriminatory policies towards religious or ethnic minorities noted James Dorsey senior fellow at the Singaporebased S Rajaratnam School of International Studies This could play out in countries with segments of ultraconservative religious communities that have different concepts of medicine or a blind faith in God to solve the problem explained Dorsey in a phone interview with FRANCE 24 The health minister who put his faith in the Messiah Tensions between the temple and laboratory were on stark display in Israel where Health Minister Yaakov Litzman a member of the ultra orthodox Ger Hasidic community told Israeli media last month that he was sure the messiah would come and save us Litzman and his wife later tested positive for coronavirus forcing several senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the head of the Mossad intelligence service into quarantine since they had been in contact with the health minister who put his faith in the messiah Critics have called for Litzman is resignation and dubbed him Typhoid Miriam after Typhoid Mary the New York cook who infected dozens at the turn of the 20th century Despite his cabinet position Litzman is primary loyalty was to the rabbinical leaders of his religious sect Yehoshua Pfeffer an ultraOrthodox expert told AFP The health minister Pfeffer noted had failed to prevent members of his ultraorthodox sect from conducting religious gatherings while the country had already imposed travel restrictions and banned mass events Netanyahu who relies on the ultraorthodox support base which makes up about 10 percent of the population has struggled to enforce the closure of synagogues and yeshivas in places such as Bnei Brak one of the country is poorest most congested cities and centre of the ultraorthodox community Members who live in selfimposed segregation have been particularly affected by the pandemic with health authorities estimating that at least 38 percent of Beni Brak residents may be carrying the coronavirus The crisis has threatened Netanyahu is coalition and its impact could stretch even deeper The ultraorthodox community is disproportionate political influence and exemption from the country is mandatory military service is a longstanding source of tension with critics calling for the integration of the Haredim as the community is called into modern Israeli life The coronavirus crisis Dorsey suggests could also threaten the community from within In Israel the ultraorthodox live in their own world they do not listen to the media they listen to the rabbi is advice The pandemic could undermine rabbinical authority on a scale not seen since the Holocaust when rabbis advised members not to leave Europe and people paid a heavy price for that advice noted Dorsey Cow urine and CoronaJihad in India Political leaders who seek religious legitimacy cater to a religious support base or initially discarded scientific advice for expedient political reasons may have met their match in the coronavirus Science has knocked religion and traditional healing methods out of the ring in the battle between rival approaches towards getting the coronavirus pandemic under control Dorsey noted in an April 7 blog Stopping COVID19 in its tracks Science gets the upper hand In the first two weeks of March while Italy was already under a nationwide lockdown supporters of India is Hindu rightwing Prime Minister Narendra Modi were hosting gaumutra parties across the country where crowds urged by saffronrobed religious leaders gulped cups of cow urine which they were told was a miracle cure against the coronavirus Although some of the events were held by senior members of Modi is Bharatiya Janata Party BJP the Indian prime minister who relies on a vast vote base of Hindutva or Hinduness supporters to win elections kept silent on the issue As the number of coronavirus cases in India mounted Modi finally took to the airwaves towards the end of March to call on his countrymen to unite in the fight against coronavirus In a widely hailed address devoid of Hindu supremacist bluster or antielitist or antiMuslim rhetoric Modi called for solidarity in the face of the deadly pandemic But weeks later as the number of coronavirus cases in India mounted national unity calls appeared to fall on deaf ears as hate crimes against Muslims spiked following a coronavirus contagion spread from a religious event organised by the Islamic missionary group Tablighi Jamat As CoronaJihad and CoronaTerrorism trended on Twitter with government spokesmen devoting more time to lambasting the Muslim religious gathering than measures to tackle the humanitarian fallout of a hastilyimposed nationwide lockdown fake news reports began to swell on WhatsApp and other platforms They in turn sparked antiMuslim attacks across the country with at least one person killed in the eastern state of Jharkhand according to Indian media reports Muslim missionary movement under scrutiny The Tablighi Jamat movement has come under scrutiny in a number of countries for its role in spreading the coronavirus in Asia A missionary movement that originated in India in the 1920s the Tablighi Jamat has branches across the world including Asia Africa Europe and the US Given the loose nature of participation and membership follower estimates are hard to gauge with the Pew Research Center noting they range from 12 to 80 million across roughly 150 countries An apolitical group focused on proselytizing and worship the Tablighi Jamat is known for its khuruj or proselytizing tours which see devotees dressed in simple clothing traveling for days sometimes months while sleeping in mosques and other religious sites The group is country branches also hold annual ijtema events which can gather millions in countries such as Bangladesh India and Pakistan A February 27 to March 1 ijtema in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur which was attented by more than 16000 people including 1500 foreigners triggered the epidemic in Malaysia as well as in Brunei with cases traced to Cambodia Singapore Thailand and the Philippines It was followed by a midMarch ijtema near the Pakistani city of Lahore which resulted in the spread of coronavirus as far afield as Gaza It was cut short by Pakistani authorities last month In India a gathering at the groups global spiritual centre or markaz in the Nizamuddin area of the Indian capital New Delhi was shut down on March 22 days before a nationwide lockdown went into effect at midnight March 25 While the religious group is irresponsibility has been widely slammed experts have noted that in India a number of mass religious gatherings took place in the same period These include a Sikh gathering in Punjab where a single super spreader preacher who died of the virus sparked a quarantine of 40000 people and a Hindu temple festival in the southern state of Kerala None of them sparked the level of public anger faced by the Tablighi Jamat Meanwhile a more controversial breach of Modi is strict nationwide lockdown occurred in Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanand the Hindu firebrand chief minister of India is most populous state led a ceremony

politicians claim pilgrims returning home were given medication to conceal rising fever readings and allowed to return to their villages spreading the epidemic to Turkey is rural areas Religion and politics have a long complicated history with each needing the other at different times in different ways in different places to survive Blasting the role of the Evangelical movement in US politics in a New York Times column author Katherine Stewart noted that Donald Trump rose to power with the determined assistance of a movement that denies science bashes government and prioritized loyalty over professional expertise In the current crisis Stewart wrote we are all reaping what that movement has sown Not all religious groups or leaders have been in opposition to science or public health directives The vast majority of priests imams and clergymen and women of different faiths across the world have seen no inconsistency in emphasising the importance of saving human life over the need for ritual gatherings But that depends on their acceptance of scientific principles and the primacy of the world of facts over issues of faith The coronavirus pandemic is exposing the dangers of rejecting science for a blind acceptance of faith Last month Trump was optimistic that the US would be opened up and just raring to go by Easter The prospect of packed churches all over our country Trump said would make it a beautiful time But as residents in his home city New York wake up to headlines of mass graves in the heart of the metropolis Trump is brash forecast of a beautiful Easter with packed churches is unlikely to be forgotten in some quarters or forgiven in the spirit of the teachings of the risen Christ

world to grant regulatory approval to a COVID19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing a move hailed by Moscow as evidence of its scientific prowess The vaccine still has to complete final trials raising concerns among some experts at the speed of its approval but the Russian business conglomerate Sistema has said it expects to put it into mass production by the end of the year The World Health Organization WHO said on Tuesday that any stamp of approval on a Covid19 vaccine candidate would require a rigorous safety data review We are in close contact with the Russian health authorities and discussions are ongoing with respect to possible WHO prequalification of the vaccine the United Nations health agency is spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva at an online press briefing Prequalification of any vaccine includes the rigorous review and assessment of all the required safety and efficacy data We are encouraged by the speed by which several candidate vaccines have been developing and as we have been always saying we hope some of these vaccines will prove to be safe and efficient said Jasarevic Accelerating progress does not mean compromising on safety he said Volunteers wanted for vaccine Russian health workers treating Covid19 patients will be offered the chance of volunteering to be vaccinated in the coming weeks a source told Reuters last month Regulatory approval paves the way for the mass inoculation of the Russian population and authorities hope it will allow the economy which has been battered by fallout from the virus to return to full capacity Kirill Dmitriev head of Russia is sovereign wealth fund hailed the development as a historic Sputnik moment comparable to the Soviet Union is 1957 launch of Sputnik 1 the world is first satellite The vaccine will be marketed under the name Sputnik V on foreign markets he said State media have trumpeted the news But the speed at which Russia has moved approving a vaccine before the final stages of clinical trials to test safety and efficacy are over has worried some scientists who fear Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety Speaking at a government meeting on state television Putin dismissed those concerns saying the vaccine developed by Moscow is Gamaleya Institute was safe and that it had even been administered to one of his daughters I know that it works quite effectively forms strong immunity and I repeat it has passed all the needed checks said Putin He said he hoped mass production would start soon Reckless and foolish The vaccine is approval by the health ministry comes before the start of a larger trial involving thousands of participants commonly known as a Phase III trial Such trials which require a certain rate of participants catching the virus to observe the vaccine is effect are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval The Moscowbased Association of Clinical Trials Organizations ACTO a trade body representing the world is top drugmakers in Russia this week urged the health ministry to postpone approval until that final trial had been successfully completed In a letter to the ministry it said there were high risks associated with registering a drug before that happened It is during this phase that the main evidence of a vaccine is efficacy is collected as well as information on adverse reactions that could appear in certain groups of patients people with weakened immunity people with concomitant diseases and so forth it said Some international experts have also questioned the speed at which Russia approved its vaccine Normally you need a large number of people to be tested before you approve a vaccine said Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen currently testing CureVac is COVID19 vaccine in clinical trials In that respect I think it is reckless to do that approve it if lots of people have not already been tested Duncan Matthews a professor of intellectual property law at Queen Mary University of London said news of a potential Covid19 vaccine was to be welcomed but safety must be the priority The US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the European Medicines Agency EMA have fasttrack approval procedures for emergency humanitarian use and we need to see evidence that Russia is adopting an equally prudent approach Matthews said in an emailed comment This is a reckless and foolish decision said Francois Balloux of University College London Any problem with the Russian vaccination campaign would be

Read more Is Africa with its low rates so far ready to face the coronavirus pandemic African countries only began reporting cases in February and most have been imported by travelers from Europe and the US South Africa announced eight new cases Friday bringing its total to 24 Amid growing worry across the country the military is preparing to repatriate 121 South African students from the epicenter of the outbreak Wuhan China The returned students and the military on the flight will immediately be placed in quarantine Africa has so far been good at containing the virus because they have detected cases early said Dr Mary Stephen technical officer at the World Health Organization regional office in Brazzaville Republic of Congo The continents numbers are low compared to the US Europe and especially Asia where the virus originated but experts and foundations warn that the emergence of COVID19 on the African continent could be catastrophic given the fragile health systems in several countries From the beginning we knew the continent is at risk Stephen told The Associated PressThe uniqueness of Africa is the fact that one we have a large population she said adding that the continent is health systems are dealing with a lot of other emergencies at the same time including Ebola The goal is to detect cases quickly isolate and manage them she said We want to prevent community transmission she said Very transparent The vast majority of people recover from the new virus The number of COVID19 cases worldwide has surpassed 120000 and 60000 people have already recovered According to the World Health Organization people with mild illness recover in about two weeks while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover Africa is hospitals may not be adequately prepared to care for large numbers of people who may need intensive care and ventilators say health experts At the start of the outbreak only two African countries had the capacity to test for COVID19 and now 43 countries have laboratories to detect cases according to the Africa CDC based in Addis Ababa Ethiopia It says all the labs have kits to carry out 100 to 200 tests The WHO and CDC are prepared to provide additional kits for 1000 tests to any country reporting a case Communication has been essential according to the WHOs Stephen who said that media and social media attention have helped The governments have also been very transparent and have reported cases as soon as they are detected she said Several African governments have already closed borders including Chad and Gabon or have suspended official travel Low volume of contact The most likely reason Africa has such a low number of cases is because of the low volume of contact between the continent and the world including fewer planes and people coming here said Augustin Augier executive director of the nongovernmental organization the Alliance for International Medical Action known as ALIMA However he warned its only a matter of time until Africa catches up in cases and the result could be a higher mortality rate The worries are very high because in a certain number of countries particularly in subSaharan Africa the health systems are already weak so if the outbreak is happening as well in these areas we can expect a much higher mortality rate than in Europe or Asia he said Despite all the preparations being made by governments The most serious cases will not have access to the people and quality of care that they deserve and could expect elsewhere he said At one point this crisis will endanger the capacity of humanitarian and relief organizations More importantly a global strategy needs to be found he stressed saying that if it hits hard in Africa it will only circle back to the US and Europe Dr JeanJacques Muyembe who has headed Congos response to Ebola warned that even with preparation COVID19 presents major challenges If the virus spreads locally and circulates in places like Congo where there are not as many prevention methods were going to face huge problems It would be a mistake to minimize the disease we must take this very seriously and do everything so that the chains of transmission are known so that we stop its expansion FRANCE 24 with AP

percent the highest since the Great Depression The world is largest economy has suffered the deadliest coronavirus outbreak with more than 77000 fatalities and nearly 13 million cases Mindful of elections in November President Donald Trump has nonetheless vowed to reopen the country and a growing number of state governors have already let business resume with precautions Trump played down the unemployment numbers as the White House pointed to substantial gains Friday on global stock markets as proof that better times were ahead We are going to have a phenomenal year next year Trump told reporters I think it is going to come back blazing His optimism came even as the virus spread within the White House with the press secretary of Vice President Mike Pence testing positive Neighboring Canada also shed three million jobs bringing its unemployment rate up to 131 percent two days after the European Union forecast a massive recession in the bloc Still fragile A number of governments are moving to ease restrictions Germany Europe is biggest economy took decisive early action that stemmed the virus and Chancellor Angela Merkel plans an almost complete return to normal within the month Italy where deaths on Friday passed 30000 plans to allow worshippers to return to church while Denmark said cinemas museums and zoos would reopen on June 8 Pakistan was due to begin easing its nationwide lockdown on Saturday even as cases continued to rise citing economic havoc that the measures have wreaked In Britain which has suffered the world is highest death toll after the United States Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to offer a roadmap out of lockdown on Sunday The European Commission recommended that the 27nation bloc keep banning nonessential entry of visitors until June 15 an extension of one month The situation remains fragile both in Europe and in the world it said in a statement The virus that has infected 39 million people worldwide overshadowed one of the most important dates on the European calendar the anniversary of the end of World War II on the continent Parades and commemorations to mark 75 years since Nazi Germany is surrender were canceled or scaled down and the thoughts of many national leaders were on fighting the new global challenge We want more not less cooperation in the world also in the fight against the pandemic German President FrankWalter Steinmeier said Russia which marks the occasion a day later than western Europe was on Saturday preparing for muted celebrations after becoming Europe is hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic A Red Square parade has been postponed and President Vladimir Putin will instead give a 20minute speech at a war memorial inside the Kremlin walls No unity at UN Far from bringing the world together the crisis has triggered a war of words between China where the virus first appeared in the metropolis of Wuhan and the United States where Trump has battled criticism over his handling of an epidemic which he boasted of having under control in January The Trump administration has brought into the mainstream a theory that the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory despite the World Health Organization and the top US epidemiologist saying there is no evidence China rejects the charge and America is allies are not convinced The feud spread Friday to the UN Security Council where the United States stunning other members prevented a vote on a resolution that called for a ceasefire in various conflicts around the world The resolution led by France and Tunisia called for a cessation of hostilities in conflict zones and a 90day humanitarian pause to allow governments to better address the pandemic among those suffering most Diplomats said the United States was concerned about language in the resolution on the role of the World Health Organization which has been at the forefront of confronting COVID19 Trump has vowed to freeze the more than 400 million in annual US funding for the UN body saying it did not act quickly enough when the mysterious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan and blindly took the word of China The US State Department on Friday also accused China and Russia of sharply escalating disinformation online about the virus including promoting conspiracy theories that it was cooked up by US scientists Home tests Researchers in Hong Kong have found that patients suffering milder illness caused by the new coronavirus recover more quickly if they are treated with a threedrug antiviral cocktail soon after symptoms appear Authors of the study published in the Lancet on Friday called for largerscale research to ascertain if the drug combo could be a viable treatment for criticallyill patients With the US death toll and infections still climbing regulators on Friday offered a way to ramp up testing a significantly simpler home diagnostic kit that uses saliva Public health workers warn that a complete return to normal is impossible until the development of a vaccine which could take months if not more Trump however has suggested that a vaccine is not a prerequisite to ending the pandemic At some point it will probably go away by itself he told reporters while adding If we had a vaccine that would be very helpful bursscteclmtp

called for a global ceasefire to fight together against the COVID19 pandemic Myanmars military has announced a nearly fourmonth truce in the conflicttorn nation The military or Tatmadaw said there will be a ceasefire from May 10 to Aug 31 with the aim of effectively and rapidly carrying out the containment prevention and treatment of COVID19 and restoring peace The Tatmadaw statement released on May 9 also quoted the UN secretarygenerals call for a ceasefire and says it will continuously strive for realizing its pledge to entrust eternal peace However Rakhine and Chin states where the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army AA are locked in fighting are excluded from the truce The Tatmadaws spokesperson has reportedly said the AA is a terrorist organization so it is not in line with imposing a ceasefire in those regions Myanmars ongoing conflict topped the agenda at a closed VCT meeting of the UN Security Council on May 14 in which European members and Britain condemned the escalating violence EU members Belgium Estonia France and Germany have called for an immediate comprehensive and nationwide ceasefire There has been an upsurge in fighting between the Tatmadaw and the AA which has been fighting for autonomy for ethnic Rakhine since December 2018 This has led to a spike in internal displacement additional restrictions on humanitarian access and an increased number of civilian fatalities including the killing of World Health Organization staff on April 20 Over 78000 people have been displaced in Rakhine and Chin states due to the ongoing conflict a more than 50 percent increase since the beginning of the year according to the UN Observers have welcomed the Tatmadaws unilateral ceasefire but there might be little change given the limited truce as conflict remains unabated in the country Another factor is that gunfire has fallen silent in most of the parts of the country including Kachin Karen and Shan states except skirmishes between the Tatmadaw and various ethnic armed groups The partial truce may not pave the way for a return to the negotiating table and dialogue towards peace So one can ask how effective it will be in the conflicttorn western region to fight COVID19 as it has already been a worse humanitarian response situation More precisely we will see more fighting that may lead to increased civilian casualties and more displaced people Rakhine has one of the highest rates of poverty and malnutrition among children in Myanmar and is home to a large number of vulnerable people including more than 200000 internally displaced persons IDPs in camps or other temporary shelters Access to healthcare and other lifesaving services in Rakhine and Chin states is very limited and the ongoing fighting is also hampering efforts to contain the COVID19 pandemic according to aid agencies It is worrisome for the healthcare of the people including IDPs in two of the poorest states and the ongoing escalation in fighting will also make people vulnerable to the coronavirus Luckily no cases of the coronavirus have been found in IDP camps in Rakhine and Chin states as of May 18 while Myanmar has reported 193 cases including six deaths and 104 recoveries The longrunning conflicts in Myanmars smaller states with large Christian populations Kachin Chin Karen and Kayah appear to have ended However they have forced more than 100000 people across the Thai border and into refugee camps and more than 100000 people forced into IDP camps in Kachin and Shan states Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has pledged to end hostilities in the country that has been bedeviled by conflict for nearly 70 years However renewed fighting in Rakhine and Chin states has hampered her peace efforts The grievances of the countrys minority groups reach back seven decades underpinning just why Myanmars minority ethnic groups see such a tough road ahead despite a concerted effort by Suu Kyis government Suu Kyis father General Aung San reached an agreement giving autonomy to the Kachin Shan and Chin ethnic groups in 1947 but the deal was never fulfilled After the 1947 conference Aung San was assassinated and the ethnic groups took up arms against the central government Since then minority ethnic people from Myanmars sevenstates have called for what Aung San agreed to a system based on federalism and autonomy During that time the rights of minority groups have been neglected during the decadeslong rule of the Bamar majoritys ironfisted military Cardinal Charles Bo of Yangon has called for the laying down of all weapons and an end to acts of aggression Now is the time for decisions that will build Myanmar as a united peaceful prosperous nation and member of the family of nations he said The lip service of the countrys leaders to end fighting and achieving peace is not enough especially during the pandemic crisis Its to show a commitment to peace with practical ways and take the opportunity for all stakeholders including the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed groups to build trust and unity to overcome the COVID19 outbreak together If we really want to be a united and peaceful nation we need to act now with courage integrity and respect Link to Image croixcomnewsmyanmartrucemustbenationwidetodefeatcovid1912407 Graphic Armed personnel in Yangon Myanmar 17 April 2020 Photo by EFEEPANYEIN CHAN NAINGMaxPPP

across the greater Paris region allowing doctors to treat coronavirus patients while relieving the burden on emergency rooms You can hear her violent coughing fits before you see her Nancy Bamba a 28yearold woman showed up at the reception desk of a Covid19 consultation centre in NogentsurMarne to the east of Paris on Tuesday My doctor sent me here because I have been having worrying symptoms for 10 days I cough and I have terrible aches and pains I caught malaria in the Ivory Coast But the fatigue I feel today is much worse it is as if all of my energy has been taken away Yesterday I had a fever of 394C 1029F said the visibly weakened woman between coughing fits Since I also have a kidney problem Im really scared After being given a surgical mask and cleaning her hands with hydroalcoholic gel Bamba settled into a huge almost empty waiting room with chairs placed about two metres apart Large mirrors installed on a whole section of the wall are a reminder that dance classes were held here before the crisis More than 400 people with Covid19 symptoms have been checked here since the centre opened after being referred by their personal doctors or the emergency services A municipal police officer outside the building verifies that anyone entering the building has an appointment After a short wait Bamba entered a smaller room where a doctor and two nurses were waiting for her The nurses immediately busied themselves taking the young woman is temperature blood pressure and blood oxygen saturation levels in a matter of minutes This last measurement is crucial in the fight against Covid19 because it can signal respiratory risk even in patients who are not experiencing any discomfort in their lungs The doctor began with a series of questions about Bamba is symptoms and possible preexisting conditions before using her stethoscope to listen to her patient is breathing It was a fairly routine consultation except that the caregivers all wore protective gear including masks gloves goggles gowns smocks and shoe coverings All the instruments and the examination table are meticulously disinfected between consultations Popup centres such as this one are performing a vital role in the battle against Covid19 The aim is to relieve emergency room crowding by first determining which patients need hospital treatment and which have weaker symptoms This is what we call separating the hot and cold flows and it is essential in the current crisis explains Dr Frédéric Thibault project coordinator of the Covid19 centre in NogentsurMarne And it is critical to the safety of medical staff and other patients which has been compromised from the start of the outbreak by insufficient resources for protecting against the virus is spread When you are used to doing surgery with robots that cost a fortune you do not imagine having to fight one day for hydroalcoholic gel said Dr Thibault pointing to a 20litre cube of homemade gel supplied by a local pharmacist Starting from nothing having to solve problems very quickly it makes me feel like Im on a mission added the doctor who has previously worked on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan Bangladesh and on the SyrianJordanian border Remote consultations as a last resort Another room in the facility is dedicated to remote consultations Doctors Pascal and Benoît Bonnet brothers from the town of NogentsurMarne were in front of a screen communicating with a patient whose image appeared in a small window The patient was given a breathing test which consisted of counting how long she could hold her breath This patient was able to count to 15 which is better than last time when she was at 11 A person who is not able to count to 5 or 6 while holding their breath would be more of a concern explained Dr Benoît Bonnet Few doctors are in favour of remote consultations in principle but the health crisis and resulting lockdown has made it impossible for most patients to travel And as doctors are having to rely more on monitoring patients remotely they have been quick to overcome any initial misgivings they may have had Dr Bonnet explained that to relieve emergency health workers especially in intensive care units we have to be fast and efficient Avoiding a crisis within a crisis With the coronavirus in France now having claimed more than 12000 lives and infected more than 118000 the demand on intensive care units and their capacity to treat more cases is taking centre stage Adding to the concerns of healthcare workers is the knowledge that the reality of the pandemic is likely worse than what the official figures suggest Many more people have symptoms of the disease but are afraid to go a doctor or call emergency services for fear of not being sick enough and overburdening the health system Worse still some elderly people prefer not to call despite worrying symptoms because they are convinced wrongly according to doctors that there is no real treatment for them How to offer care to those who may be falling through the cracks in the system prompted local doctors to organise the first Covid19 outpatient consultation centre in NogentsurMarne Several of these centres have since sprung up in the Paris region with healthcare workers all on the same mission mobilisation solidarity and doing one is bit to fight the pandemic Community solidarity has played a part Protective clothing such as overalls hats and coverings for shoes were provided by school canteens in NogentsurMarne Protective visors were sent by Shields a network of volunteers equipped with 3D printers The heavy examination tables were on loan from a physiotherapist colleague As for the masks the centre initially received 200 FFP2 masks for frontline medical staff enough to last five days and 4000 surgical masks Like everywhere else the search for FFP2 masks is in full swing and everyone is working hard to collect donations from their personal networks From firms to private individuals with business links to China to the widows of doctors who found old kits dating from the 2009 H1N1 threat all are on the hunt for supplies It is a good thing I kept the equipment I used when I was an emergency doctor explains Dr AnneMarie BénéteauBechara one of the founders of the centre I was able to bring my ECG machine which is used to monitor the activity of the heart a device to check the level of oxygen in the blood and arm cuffs of several sizes to take blood pressure Testing limited Along with the resourcefulness of the staff a high level of organisation keeps the centre is daily operations running smoothly Medical workers shifts are limited to three hours to ensure that their concentration is always at its peak Patients in the large waiting room are kept to a minimum And access to certain areas is limited by notices posted to keep patients and healthcare workers from crossing paths too closely in the corridors Bamba is just outside the door of the consulting room She was told by her doctor that her examination did not show any lung infection and the young woman is being sent home with a prescription for paracetamol acetaminophen I was told that I had the symptoms of Covid19 and was offered a remote consultation in three days to reassess my situation I was already taking Doliprane paracetamol and I was not offered a screening test or any other options she says sounding a little disappointed Doctors at the Covid19 centre are regularly confronted with requests for tests but they can only carry them out in very special cases for healthcare workers pregnant women and people with respiratory difficulties or certain chronic diseases Although France has strict rules that limit the number of tests for coronavirus many doctors are already reluctant to use them According to them the tests that use nasal swabs are unreliable because they deliver a high proportion of false negatives These test results can have serious repercussions a patient who thinks they are not carrying Covid19 risks lowering their guard around others when in fact they are contagious Every day we explain to patients that there is no effective treatment against the new coronavirus it is very frustrating for us explains Dr Pascaline Mourey a general practitioner in BrysurMarne after a consultation at the Covid19 centre When a patient is not doing well we try to ascertain whether to send them to hospital knowing that we should not do that too early during a health crisis Out of about 50 patients seen each day at the Covid19 centre five or six are transferred to a hospital The triage work done by the centre is offering a muchneeded respite to the overstretched emergency room workers at a time when France is still struggling to lower its rising coronavirus cases and fatalities This article has been translated from the original in French

risk of COVID19 spreading to Libya in particular to the detention centres where migrants attempting to pass through Libya to Europe are held Of course the issues around migration have been bubbling away in Europe for years Long before COVID19 migrants arriving in Europe have been screened for disease The influx of migrants to Europe has provoked debate over whether the governments of European countries are obliged to let in refugees or preserve their citizens quality of life COVID19 is not the first international crisis to provoke such debates but it is the most widespread and severe A virus represents a different order of threat from any terrorist grouping criminal network or other problems that have been discussed in the debate on migration This virus will bring to a sharp and unavoidable point all of the political debates that have been raging in Europe about the migrant question The risks from COVID19 spreading in Libya are numerous Its ongoing civil war in has drastically reduced the capacity of the health and social services in the country to respond to or contain a major outbreak The continuing fighting makes it extremely difficult for international or domestic organisations and healthcare workers to do their jobs The damage to Libyas public facilities like its sanitation system electrical grid and hospitals has further drastically reduced the countrys capacity to handle anything like the major outbreaks that have been seen elsewhere The situation in the migrant detention centres is even more acute Extreme overcrowding notably worse access to public facilities than the rest of Libya poorly trained guards and staff and limited access for healthcare professionals and NGOs are the most obvious issues These are combined with an already serious reality of malnourishment and general poor health among the migrants held in the centres and a complete incapacity of the Libyan authorities on either side of the conflict to provide care for the migrants in any case The detention centres in Libya would be probably the most catastrophic place for a possible outbreak to occur With no capacity to quarantine or socially distance to say nothing of the extremely limited testing capacity in Libya generally and the centres in particular the virus would go unchecked With the already dismal conditions and weakened state of many migrants the death toll would be significantly higher than in nearly any other imaginable context where the virus could spread The real issue for Europe arises with the rescue of migrants from the Mediterranean after an outbreak has been confirmed in one or more of the detention centres There has already been enormous controversy on the continent over the rescue of migrants adrift at sea at both governmental and citizen level The issue is one of the most divisive in European politics and certainly long before COVID19 had bitterly divided opinion in many countries who have received the bulk of all arrivals in particular Italy and Greece What happens now if a privatelyoperated ship rescues a boatload or more of migrants and attempts to dock at an Italian port After the passengers have been crammed together onboard for several days it is certain that if even one of them has COVID19 it will have spread to other migrants and probably the ships crew as well Even if the risks are small even if resources and controls are in place to prevent COVID19 spreading from the arrivals to the general population even if COVID19 has already spread through Italy the risk is still there If even one person in Italy dies from a case of COVID19 linked to the arrival of a ship carrying migrants the government will be accused of failing to protect its citizens Numbers relative percentages of risk and infection vectors are useless here This problem is at the core of European politics What choice will the Italian government make in this scenario What are the obligations of the EU to the citizens of its member states Both individual countries like Italy and the EU overall will need to strike the political balance between the needs of their citizens and the humanitarian obligation to provide shelter for refugees and migrants Is the government of Italy or Greece or Spain or the EU itself obliged to devote already scarce resources in a time of pandemic to screening and caring for migrants The NGOs and other organisations that bring migrants into Italian ports occasionally in direct contravention of the governments orders are already the subjects of debate and criticism in Europe These organisations could now be accused of worsening a public health crisis even if it is only a small or statistically negligible increase And again statistics and figures are useless here These debates cut through to the true nature of the relationship between a government and its citizens and the answers are based on things far beyond numbers or scientific analysis I have used the Italian government as an example here but this scenario and the associated political questions could apply to any government in Europe and it applies most directly to the EU itself The outbreak of COVID19 in Libya and specifically in the migrant detention centres is a certainty and indeed may very well have occurred already The duty of the state to its citizens versus its duty to noncitizens has been debated for millennia in every part of the world No easy or clear answers have been found Now the EU must ask itself the same question what is the duty of the EU to the citizens of the Union This is a political debate one that will shape the future of Europe The EU would be best served by having it now before the inevitable outbreak in Libya occurs Niall McGlynn studied International

already signed deals for vital medical supplies In France and Germany senior officials said the United States was paying far above the market price for medicalgrade masks from No 1 producer China on occasion winning contracts through higher bids even after European buyers believed a deal was done and Brazil is health minister reported a similar incident Money is irrelevant They pay any price because they are desperate one highlevel official in German Chancellor Angela Merkel is ruling CDUCSU group told Reuters A German government source said Americans are on the move carrying a lot of money Since the virus was first recorded in China late last year the pandemic has spread around the world Governments in Europe the Americas and elsewhere are desperately trying to build up supplies

President Donald Trump said on Friday that the US government is now recommending Americans wear cloth face coverings on a voluntary basis to stem the spread of the virus but the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC does not recommend wearing medicalgrade masks He also said he was signing a directive to stop the export of N95 respirator masks which provide essential protection for healthcare workers and other US medical equipment USlisted multinational 3M Co said Friday that the White House had ordered it to stop all shipments to Canada and Latin America of respirators that it manufactures in the United States despite what 3M called significant humanitarian implications Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the blocking of the flow of equipment

abroad through August Weve gotten our hands on every bit of it that we can the official said Lea Crager a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA the agency coordinating the search for medical supplies abroad said disasters often lead to price increases for certain goods If it causes some sort of a supply chain disruption youre going to see costs rise for an essential commodity Crager said It just happens In Brazil Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said this week that China had ditched some Brazilian equipment orders when the US government sent more than 20 cargo planes to the country to buy the same products Our purchases which we expected to complete in order to be able to supply many were dropped said the minister in an interview on Wednesday On Thursday Mandetta said Brazil had finally succeeded in placing a 12 billion reais 228 million order for equipment although it will only be delivered in 30 days A second German source employed by a

spread of coronavirus among the 18 million people displaced across the region by the decadelong Boko Haram insurgency Northeast Nigeria has yet to register any confirmed infections but aid workers fear the virus could rampage through the overcrowded camps a catastrophe for a population already living on the edge Around the regional capital Maiduguri hundreds of thousands are crammed into governmentcontrolled camps or huddled in makeshift shelters at unofficial locations Running water is rare and conditions are often squalid This epidemic is scary we ardently pray against it Aishatu Abubakar a resident of the Bakassi camp housing 30000 people told AFP It is a double calamity we have been grappling with insecurity and now this disease has reared its head Bunu Bukar Muhammad cofounder of local charity Smile Mission Healthcare has been trying to spread the word about coronavirus in the camp setting up facilities and teaching people how to wash their hands correctly But he admits there are major challenges in the crowded conditions Things like social distancing are quite difficult to adopt in this context he told AFP In a bid to prevent infections the local authorities have banned all visitors from entering the camps they control But those living in the informal settlements that stud the city insist that not enough is being done We have not received any aid at all said Umar Gwoza who lives with his family at one of the unofficial sites We are in need of hand gloves face masks and hand sanitiser to protect ourselves More than 10 years of jihadist rebellion has left northeast Nigeria in no state to deal with a global pandemic Only half of the roughly 700 health facilities in Borno state the epicentre of the violence are still working and many have been damaged by the fighting There is no health system to contain that virus and the sick It will spread like wildfire and affect all involved including security said one United Nations worker on condition of anonymity It is really scary Those living in the camps are no strangers to the spread of diseases Cholera has broken out repeatedly and aid workers are falling back on their experience of dealing with other diseases to try to stave off coronavirus But an easily transmitted virus could prove devastating in the camps even if the average age of the population is young For the IDPs internally displaced people if they get infected and need more help they cannot get it the UN worker said Their immune system will be easily compromised because of poor diet and other conditions like poor sanitation and lack of water Their situation could be dire The UN on Tuesday announced it was taking emergency preparedness and response measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus among the most vulnerable people in the northeast That means ensuring supplies of clean water helping to provide soap launching media campaigns on the coronavirus and scrambling to bring in crucial equipment such as ventilators from overseas A medical source told AFP that in Borno state there are currently only 10 ventilators which are needed for patients who are unable to breathe on their own because of lung damage caused by the virus Our priority is to ensure the continuous delivery of lifesaving assistance especially health services Edward Kallon the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria said in a statement More than ever it is crucial for vulnerable people to have access to not only water soap shelters but also food education and protection Beyond the nightmare scenario of a major outbreak in the camps humanitarian organisations worry that global disruptions from the pandemic could soon hit efforts to reach the 71 million people in desperate need of assistance Nigeria which by Thursday had confirmed 174 infections and 2 deaths from the novel coronavirus has closed its borders and shut down international flights The government says humanitarian assistance will still get in and has pledged to provide those displaced with two months of food rations But aid workers are concerned that the virus could see tighter official controls donor funds going elsewhere and problems bringing in equipment and key personnel like the helicopter pilots who fly to remote locations The military already imposes stringent travel restrictions on aid groups Coupled with insecurity that saw 12 humanitarian workers killed in the region last year the restrictions have left some 12 million people beyond the reach of aid groups The northeast of Nigeria where the big part of our operations is concentrated is a highly unpredictable and volatile environment to work in Alyona Synenko spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Nigeria told AFP Restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the virus add another layer of complexity on how we deliver humanitarian assistance

Libya on March 24 with two rival governments fighting to take control of the country and a health system that has been on its knees for nearly a decade amid the chaos that followed the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafis regime in 2011 Libyas first coronavirus patient has been placed in isolation in a hospital in the capital Tripoli according to the health minister in Fayez alSarrajs UNbacked Government of National Accord GNA The patient is a 73yearold man who entered Libya through Tunisia in early March after staying in Saudi Arabia His direct entourage consisting of more than 20 people tested negative local media reported Initially it seems that many in Libya thought they were safe from the pandemic that has spread throughout the world including to the countrys North African neighbours We are sheltered from the virus in Libya whose capital is under siege and where land and air links are closed Moayed alMissaoui an academic told Agence FrancePresse earlier in March However the UN now fears a catastrophic outcome while the two armed camps Sarrajs GNA and Field Marshal Marshal Khalifa Haftars Libyan National Army LNA continue their military operations against each other This has led to concerns about the risks for civilians who find themselves trapped amid the clashes as well as for migrants held in detention centres some of which are located near combat zones We are deeply concerned as the first COVID19 case is reported in Libya tweeted the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Libya The health and safety of all people in Libya including 345000 of the most vulnerable is at risk A possible outbreak will overwhelm the already stretched aid response Health system already close to collapse It is no surprise that the UN body is anxious Libyas healthcare system has been in constant decline because too many hospitals and clinics have been damaged during the fighting the International Committee of the Red Cross has pointed out Despite the efforts of the UN and NGOs a shortage of qualified personnel the disruption of supply chains due to the conflict and the lack of medicine and medical equipment are making healthcare provision difficult and not just in isolated parts of the country This is a health system that was close to collapse before you get the coronavirus Elizabeth Hoff head of mission for the World Health Organisation in Libya told Reuters earlier this week For its part the 2019 Global Health Security Index ranks the country at 185 out of 195 for its ability to respond to the spread of an epidemic We

the already stretched aid response The time to act prevent is now OCHA Libya OCHA_Libya March 25 2020 In a sign of their shared awareness of the potential gravity of the situation both the GNA whose powerbase is in Tripoli and the LNA based in eastern Libya had anticipated the arrival of the coronavirus by taking preventive measures imposing night time curfews and closing some public places The GNA health ministry urged all medical staff on March 26 to go and work on the frontline in hospitals where healthcare workers have already been mobilised to be ready for a potential coronavirus pandemic The GNA also announced that several quarantine sites including two in Tripoli will be set up to isolate people infected with the disease People are already struggling to access healthcare Nevertheless Ahmed alHassi the spokesman for the Haftars Coronavirus Epidemic Advisory Medical Committee said earlier in the week that regardless of the number of beds and intensive care rooms that have been prepared Libya would be unable to cope with an epidemic due to its limited capabilities People are already struggling to access healthcare for routine treatment and hospitals are already struggling with large numbers of victims of the fighting in Tripoli Liam Kelly Libya director at the Danish Refugee Council told Jeune Afrique a Parisbased Africafocused weekly Measures are being taken across the country but the weakness of the healthcare system is dramatic Libyans have certainly taken precautions as demonstrated by products selling out at supermarkets and pharmacies Stocks of sanitary products such as hand wipes masks and gloves have been running short Mounir elHazel who heads a medical imports firm told Agence FrancePresse But despite such preventive measures on the part of civilians the fact remains that the military situation is not conducive to an effective fight against a coronavirus epidemic In response to the looming threat from Covid19 a truce was put in place and accepted by both sides on March 22 under the auspices of several countries and the UN However both the GNA and LNA have subsequently accused the other of violating this agreement Tripoli was notably the target of bombing during the night of March 24 to 25 while there were reports of fresh clashes on an air base close to the capital that has been targeted in an offensive by GNA forces On Wednesday the United Nations Support Mission in Libya UNSMIL lamented the fact that while the whole world is engaged in fighting the spread of COVID19 which has overwhelmed wellresourced countries attacks and counter attacks in Libya continue to inflict further suffering and civilian casualties In light of this UNSMIL urged an immediate deescalation so that Libyans can shift their focus to the fight against COVID19 But it will be difficult for this call to be heard considering the absence of a truce respected by both parties This article was adapted from the original in French

Calais police arrive to evict asylum seekers and migrants from their makeshift camps every other day For now the closing of national borders due to COVID19 has scuppered any hope for these people to leave France for a new life in the UK But it is not just about the game of cat and mouse with the authorities what has become clear for those living on the fringes of society in France is that this health emergency has made their daily struggle for survival a lot harder Asylum seeker Throughout France charities have been forced to scale down aid following weeks of lockdown Supporting the needs of an estimated thousand people in Calais has become a challenge There is less of a presence in the camps less services So the conditions are getting worse And from another side those who are helping

answers to administrative procedures undertaken with the help of Sofia and her team at Baraka Association even longer And with lockdown ending the threat of eviction is looming I fear the worst I fear

community shares two toilets and a water hose Rozora squat resident While no case of coronavirus has been identified in the squat but health professionals fear the risk is never far away e see patients with cardiovascular diseases respiratory diseases These are vulnerable health conditions that are potentially very serious in terms of COVID19 The challenge is to identify these and get them taken care of properly Thatl make it possible to stop the disease from spreading and perhaps save some beds in intensive care units But the real question is How do we properly take care of the most fragile the homeless and give them decent living conditions to avoid problems wee seeing If we taken care of this before we probably have far fewer serious cases and better follow upnsists Samuel Guevart from Medecins du Monde I will risk death to find food for the children Decent living conditions for the poor it a plight which torments Kamel who regularly helps a large family of Roma that

silent in tribute to Larni Zuniga a victim of COVID19 who had died four days earlier Described by colleagues as a treasured nurse whose dedication and compassion were second to none 54yearold Zuniga had just become a British citizen 12 years after moving from the Philippines After years of waiting his wife was finally receiving the documents to reunite with him She would have arrived in June had COVID19 not arrived first This tragedy and countless others are exposing not only the enormous suffering that COVID19 can generate but also how skewed the building blocks of our society are Where people carrying out essential work caring for the elderly or children building roads delivering food picking fruit and stacking shelves are invariably among the lowest paid and very often have a migrant background These people do not have the luxury of working from home and as a result are more easily exposed to the virus We should keep this in mind when we commit not to leave anyone behind Migrants like homeless people women and children in abusive households people in detention and others face greater risks during this crisis By showing how much our societies rely on what is considered low skilled work of which a good deal is carried out by migrants this crisis should prompt us to reassess how we want to govern mobility going forward once restrictions are eased COVID19 has paralysed our movements for a few weeks but only time will tell whether it will affect migratory patterns into and within Europe in the longer term If restrictions remain in place for long and unemployment rates increase dramatically we may expect reduced movement However migrations main drivers utter inequality and the human aspiration to improve ones conditions are not bound to disappear anytime soon And labour market segmentation means that even a less prosperous Europe will still have labour shortages Look for instance at how the harvest season has started with a shortage of pickers in the fields due to Eastern European seasonal workers being unable to travel This leaves them stranded without income in countries with weaker social safety nets But also leaves agricultural businesses begging governments to regularise undocumented migrants present on their territories Regularisations may provide temporary respite but systemic solutions will be needed in the longer term If we want people to move through safe and regular pathways rather than irregularly we need to ensure those pathways exist More broadly the fact that governments only remember migrants when they need them reveals an embarrassing lack of empathy for people particularly at risk during the pandemic If at a minimum temporary regularisations are needed it is primarily to ensure people can access basic assistance without fear The same lack of empathy is on display at Europes borders where thousands of people are trapped in unrelentingly harsh conditions courtesy of Europes containment policies Imagine being among 34000 asylumseekers including older people pregnant women and children confined in camps on Greek islands which have capacity for 6000 Evidently Greek authorities should transfer asylumseekers to the mainland and other EU countries should offer places for relocation It is good that a few unaccompanied children are being transferred to other EU states but that just scratches the surface Or imagine being among people returned to conflictridden Libya by the EUsupported Libyan Coast Guard Even if you were lucky enough not to be taken to a detention centre where arbitrary detention is the rule and torture a likely possibility you would still be exposed to COVID19 in a country where poorlyequipped hospitals are often targeted In truth COVID19 is not only compounding already dramatic situations for refugees and migrants but also providing unscrupulous governments with a chance to build Fortress Europe even higher Italy and Malta have reinstated closed port policies effectively abandoning people at sea with the latter accused of having set up a clandestine fleet of fishing vessels to carry out pushbacks towards Libya Austria Cyprus and Hungary have restricted access to asylum Bosnia has confined thousands in a camp in appalling conditions And the list goes on At this time the EU should provide humanitarian assistance to people stranded in countries less capable to confront the crisis not more speedboats to contain them there It should create the conditions for refugees to be resettled to Europe and relocated within Europe rather than keeping them away at any cost And it should start rebuilding systems to govern migration and asylum in ways that are effective and humane Systems able to respond to international obligations to labour market needs but also to our shared responsibility to use all available tools including mobility to tackle poverty and inequality Amidst the difficulties resides the opportunities for all of us to learn from the dedication and compassion that made Larni Zuniga a man who came from afar to look after us so cherished among his friends ____________ Are you a recognised expert in your field At

ambushed as it carried COVID19 sample tests in conflictstricken Rakhine and the driver an employee of the World Health Organization died and another health worker was injured This is the latest civilian fatality in Myanmars western region which has been embroiled in an intensifying civil war between the military and the Arakan Army demanding more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyis office blamed the Arakan Army for the attack an accusation they deny The attack on the UN vehicle has drawn strong condemnation from the United Nations NGOs and rights groups and calls for an independent investigation into the case UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the family of the deceased and wished a swift recovery to the injured He called for a full and transparent investigation into the incident and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice The fatal shooting in Minbya township in Rakhine came three days after the UN voiced grave concern over the surge in civilian casualties Myanmars military has been carrying out almost daily air strikes and shelling in populated areas resulting in at least 32 deaths and 71 injuries since March 23 the majority women and children Rupert Colville UN human rights office spokesman told a Geneva news briefing on April 17 They have also been destroying and burning schools and homes Some 16 humanitarian agencies including Save the Children World Vision and Christian Aid have said the April 20 shooting demonstrates the urgent need for armed actors in Myanmar to lay down their weapons heeding the call of the UN secretarygeneral for a global ceasefire The UN chief and Pope Francis have called for an end to fighting in the time of a pandemic crisis and returning to the peace table But the calls have been largely ignored and fighting remains unabated in the Southeast Asian nation which is bedeviled with decadesold civil wars Conflict has escalated in Rakhine since the government designated the Arakan Army a terrorist organization on March 23 leading to more civilian casualties and displacement The Arakan Army is a largely Buddhist militia fighting for greater autonomy for indigenous Rakhine in the state The guerrilla outfit was formed in 2009 to protect ethnic Rakhine and is estimated to have several thousand wellequipped soldiers Some ethnic armed groups including the Karen National Union the Chin National Front and the Karenni National Progressive Party have called on the civilian government and the military to announce a nationwide ceasefire Myanmars military however rejected the call as they reportedly said the Tatmadaw declared a unilateral ceasefire for nine months last year Rights groups say the Tatmadaw is doing little where it counts ending the longrunning ethnic conflicts in Myanmars borderlands While the attention of the globe has been concentrated on the battle against COVID19 Myanmars military has cynically seized the opportunity to intensify its offensive in Rakhine state with predictable results of increased displacement hardship and rights abuses against civilians Phil Robertson deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch said in an April 21 statement Civil society organizations in Myanmar have called for the immediate protection of those who have nothing to do with the fighting The current targeting of innocent civilians in the conflict between the military and the Arakan Army amounts to war crimes and must immediately cease 139 civil society organizations said in an April 15 statement As the world is still struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic Myanmars military has reinforced its offensive in Rakhine The conflict in Rakhine which spilled over into neighboring Chin state has displaced more than 100000 people since it began December 2018 Some 120000 mostly Rohingya uprooted by 2012 violence live in dilapidated camps in central Rakhine Rakhine also has a separate conflict that has seen more than 700000 Rohingya flee to Bangladesh since August 2017 due to military offensives While COVID19 prevention and awareness campaigns have been carried out in urban areas people from conflict regions are more concerned about their security rather than the deadly virus Despite the COVID19 threat looming in conflicttorn regions civilians have little time to worry about anything else amid intensified clashes between the military and the Arakan Army Rakhine has some of the most severe rates of poverty and malnutrition among children in Myanmar and is home to large numbers of vulnerable populations including more than 200000 internally displaced persons IDPs in camps or other temporary shelters according to humanitarian agencies The agencies said access to healthcare and other lifesaving services in the state is very limited Meanwhile in Rakhine and Chin states more than one million people have been blocked from internet access since last

to the latest data As of April 20 there has been no case of COVID19 in camps for IDPs in displacement sites or in communities directly affected by conflict according to the UN Myanmars health system

cooperation in the world also in the fight against the pandemic Steinmeier said Far from bringing the world together the crisis has triggered a war of words between China where the virus first appeared in the metropolis of Wuhan and the United States where Trump has battled criticism over his handling of an epidemic which he boasted of having under control in January The Trump administration has brought into the mainstream a theory that the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory despite the World Health Organization and the top US epidemiologist saying there is no evidence

Wuhan and blindly took the word of China The US State Department on Friday also accused China and Russia of sharply escalating disinformation online about the virus including promoting conspiracy theories that it was cooked up by US scientists Home tests by saliva With the US death toll and infections still climbing regulators on Friday offered a way to ramp up testing a diagnostic kit that uses saliva The Food and Drug Administration gave emergency approval to the homecollection option which is significantly easier than the most common test which involves swabbing inside a patient is nose The new kit developed by Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory is a rare test that does not require a trip to a doctor or other testing site Public health workers warn that a complete return to

as a National Day of Prayer to seek divine help and strength in the face of the coronavirus the initiative did not receive much national attention This raises some interesting question regarding the place of prayer and faith during times of national and global epidemics like we are currently experiencing Research shows that there is a correlation between prayer and a positive health outcome This is because religious faith gives people hope in the face of crisis It also inspires positive ethical responses and changes in lifestyles that limit unsafe behavior than can expose people to diseases and infections However Christians and people of faith have diverse opinions and convictions about the efficacy of prayer in bringing an end to an outbreak of this kind This is because of the diverse ways in which religious people respond to the two crises of faith that emerge during an epidemic No religious explanations no religious solutions The first is the inadequacy of religious explanations for outbreaks like COVID19 The second is the ineffectiveness of religious solutions to contain and mitigate the spread and effects of epidemics without paying attention to the germtheory of diseases These two realities were clearly evident in the greatest outbreak in human history the Great Plague 134750 that killed more than onethird of the population of Europe This plague created a crisis of faith among Christians about Gods ability to save them because religious leaders were among the many people who died The prayers rituals and religious processions through the streets to ask for divine intervention apparently did not bring physical healing The people quickly realized that being religious or spiritual does not immune anyone from diseases infections and death Providing comfort and hope However religious people believe that prayer and religious faith do offer an access to spiritual energy Faith makes an appeal to a higher power which brings comfort to Christians by the healing grace that Christians believe only God can give Religious faith also helps Christians to make sense of evil diseases and outbreaks like COVID19 It helps them look with hope beyond the shadows of the present uncertain times Historically Christians everywhere have always relied on prayer in moments of anxiety and uncertainty American Religious historians Daniel Reff and Rodney Stark attribute the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire to the ability of religion to create a strong social network and to offer people healing rituals and charitable outreach and solidarity in the face of the frequent plagues and infectious diseases that besieged the population The pope petitions and spiritual solidarity It was not surprising that Pope Francis recently visited the shrines containing the icon of Mary and the Crucifix of St Marcello two important places where many Catholics over the centuries have gone to pray for divine help during outbreaks of disease The pope prayed for an end to the outbreak and healing for the sick That is because he believes prayer is a form of spiritual solidarity through which we can be close to one another and to God In praying for healthcare workers at these shrines Francis implicitly admitted the instrumental role of human agency in bringing health to the sick and and stopping the spread of the coronavirus Closing churches for better or for worse At the same time that he was visiting these important shrines in Rome churches in North America and Europe were shutting their doors for public worship and Mass in an effort to stem the virus spread These represent two contrasting realities and show the tension even among Christians and their leaders about what to do in times like these Some Catholics have expressed reservation at what they perceive as extreme measures that deny them the opportunity to experience spiritual contact and healing from God through public worship which has been the Christian communitys way of responding to plagues in the past Catholic commentators such as RR Reno editor of First Things argue that closing churches is a betrayal of spiritual care But the question worth answering is whether it really is a lack of faith to take precautions against infection which includes closing churches in order to enforce social distancing A bishop warns against fideism and urges charity In the Diocese of Vanne in northwest France for instance resistance to church closures was so strong that the local bishop Raymond Centène was forced to make a public statement in which he warned that risking ones health and that of ones neighbor by congregating in large numbers for religious services was not an act of charity He also advised the people that praying for health without taking any precautions to prevent the spread of the disease is not faith but fideism The bishops message is apt for our times because fideism is a blind faith which could actually worsen the outbreak This happens when people of faith neglect to take the necessary precautions validated by science while believing and praying that God will protect them from infection One must also reject the false claim of those Christian leaders who blame God for this outbreak saying it is divine punishment for the sins of the world Rather than blaming God a particular country political party or national government there should be a national and global effort to fight this scourge Faith should inspire people to see our common humanity under threat to see in those who are suffering a brother or sister so that we can all work together in lifting up those who are weak comforting those who are dying and giving hope to those who are frightened Science and religion I have seen the destructiveness of irrational faith from my experience in the humanitarian sector in Africa during the fight against HIVAIDS and Ebola Many people believed that one of the reasons for the high mortality of Ebola in West Africa during the initial phase of the 2014 outbreak was because people sought spiritual healing rather than selfisolating and avoiding bodily contact Many of the traditional and Christian healers who claimed to have supernatural powers to cure people of the Ebola virus ended up dying and infecting so many others Albert Einstein said Science without religion is lame religion without science is blind I believe in the power of prayer But I also believe that prayer must go handinhand with good works good science best practices sound judgment and bold human effort and action The axiom of the preacher is so true for our uncertain times Pray as if everything depends on God and work as if everything depends on you Therefore everyone beginning with our national leaders and including all the rest of us should pray for the courage to assume full responsibility for what each of us must do to contain and mitigate this pandemic While the call to prayer should be left to religious leaders the heads of our governments should concentrate their energy on uniting their countries comforting their nation and leading the charge against this outbreak with truth and clarity in a nonpartisan manner Stan Chu Ilo is a Catholic

to abolish the right to asylum in Hungary Gerald Knaus founder of the European Stability Initiative thinktank said on Twitter In fact as Gyorgy Bakondi national security adviser to the prime minister announced on March 1 Hungary has indefinitely suspended access to border transit areas for asylum seekers because of the risks related to the spread of the COVID19 We observe a certain link between coronavirus and illegal migrants he said at a press conference without however giving any data to support his claim No cases of COVID19 in Hungary In Hungary no cases of coronavirus have yet been recorded and all 125 tests performed have given a negative result According to the government the majority of illegal migrants travel to Hungary from Iran or through Iran The majority of recent arrivals are not Syrian they are mostly from Afghanistan Pakistan and Iran he added As journalist Viktória Serdült points out Bakondi has not however mentioned that Iranians who have come to the Hungarian border from Turkey have been in Turkish detention centres for years and have certainly not visited Tehran and its surroundings recently Iranians are the fourth nationality among asylum seekers in Hungary just 22 applications behind Afghanistan 185 Iraq 157 and Pakistan 27 Knaus told Euronews that Orban has for years said the era of universal human rights is only liberal blabla hypocrisy He speaks of invasion in military terms He added that Hungary is prime minister has already gotten people used to the thought of suspending asylum laws and is now using this crisis to put an end to it definitively Hungary is antimigrant fence After the migration crisis of 2015 Hungary erected a fence along the border with Serbia and along with Croatia Blocked by the fence migrants who wish to enter Hungary have no choice but to go through one of the two transit zones set up at the border one in Tompa and one in Röszke The asylum applications are processed in stations set up in shipping containers surrounded by barbed wire There have been numerous reports of violations of law and escalations in the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers Some quote newly operated women handcuffed to hospital beds cancer patients who are not treated for months or migrants left without food for days Less than two asylum applications per day In fact Bakondi is announcement only has little effect on the actual situation as the number of people who have legally made it across the border are few and far between Asylum applications are systematically rejected the rejection rate was 924 in 2019 if the authorities prove that the migrants have passed through Serbia or Greece countries which are considered to be safe According to the figures provided by Bakondi there are currently 321 people in these transit corridors In 2018 367 people applied for international protection in Hungary In 2019 this number was 394 Considering the 250 working days That is less than two approved asylum applications per day on average Since December 2019 everything has stopped the Hungarian NGO Helsinki Committee stated Only a dozen people have been admitted to Röszke since the beginning of the year The NGO also denounces that the de facto provision puts an end to access to asylum in the country because those two transit points are the only ones where asylum applications can be submitted András Léderer of the Helsinki Committee calls the link between coronavirus and immigration the umpteenth step forward with regards to the government is xenophobic hysteria Fear of another refugee crisis Hungary is announcement came after Ankara allowed thousands of migrants to head to the EU in an attempt to put pressure on European leaders during the Turkish offensive in Syria Hungary will not open its doors and will not let anyone pass concluded Bakondi adding that military and police reinforcements will be sent to the country is borders Hungarian authorities did not respond to our request for comment A suspension in violation of international law Greece has also announced that it will suspend asylum requests However only for a month According to Alberto Alemanno professor of European law at the HEC University of Paris the Greek suspension represents a manifest breach of both European asylum law and international humanitarian law by creating an unprecedented mechanism that will likely condemn deserving asylum applicants to deportation and death Alemanno suspects that the only merit to Greece is actions is to scale up the migration issue politically in a similarily to Matteo Salvini in Italy a move that drives the issue forward within the European Commission Knaus is more pessimistic If you declare a national emergency and the people support you the national and international courts of justice become very weak Hungary has already shown that it knows how to ignore the sentences that come from Europe Politicians must demonstrate today more than ever that it is possible to protect borders without renouncing the protection of human rights The European Commission has already referred Hungary to the European Court of Justice on the grounds of the excessive limits to the right to asylum Neither the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees nor the EU laws represent a legal basis for suspending asylum applications UNHCR stresses in a statement about tensions at the border between Greece and Turkey

been pushing for a return to conciliation ever since President Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal their voices have become much more prominent since the coronavirus pandemic reached Iran and started claiming lives on a grand scale But the advocates for sanctions relief are as misguided now as they were when the Iranian regime was facing a different set of crises Their position depends on the mistaken assumption that money sent to Iran would primarily end up benefiting the civilian population In fact anyone who is appropriately familiar with recent Iranian history should understand that the clerical regime has a long history of misappropriating public funds including those that are offered to the government as part of a relief package There is no reason to believe that this pattern of behaviour would change in the midst of the ongoing crisis On the contrary there is ample evidence that Tehran has already indulged its most selfserving impulses in that context In a report published on 6 March the National Council of Resistance of Iran NCRI reported that Iran had ample medical resources when the outbreak was just beginning yet diverted many of these away from hospitals While regime officials enjoyed marginally better protection from the virus at exclusive private hospitals the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps distributed masks and other essential equipment to its proxies in Iraq before selling much of the rest on the black market at extortionate prices Meanwhile the public was left twisting in the wind their hardships not just ignored but actively magnified by regime authorities Dozens of Iranians have been arrested for rumour mongering about the coronavirus outbreak since the first cases were publicly acknowledged in midFebruary Of course the information leading to those arrests has almost invariably proven more accurate than the highly questionable infection rates and death tolls released by the government While Tehran maintains that the number of fatalities only recently to be around 4000 the NCRI and other independent sources find that well over 20000 people have already died The latter figure is much more consistent with leaks from Iranian medical professionals some of whom report losing dozens of patients every single day while working in facilities that are crowded well beyond capacity These disclosures shine a spotlight on the regimes incompetence in dealing with this and other crises And at the same time the regimes denials highlight the fact that it would be difficult to trace the impact of relief that is left in the authorities hands No reasonable person is advocating to cut Iran off from medical resources and other humanitarian aid while leaving the population to suffer under the thumb of a negligent and repressive government But it is important to note that the existing US sanctions never did that in the first place As the White House has noted each time Tehran has accused it of making the coronavirus outbreak worse the sanctions already have builtin exceptions for humanitarian needs Iran is free to invoke these exceptions but instead the regime has worked tirelessly to exploit the coronavirus pandemic as a means of increasing pressure on the US to lift all sanctions This would effectively give away resources to the theocratic dictatorship without any plan for monitoring spending or making sure that goods actually reach the public As Iranian opposition leader Maryam Rajavi underscored human rights groups and the United Nations should take a leading role in any coronavirus relief efforts Crucially this would involve a level of international access that would put those same groups in a position to address other problems that cannot be solved by throwing money at a fundamentally untrustworthy regime And this includes longstanding problems that have been made worse by Tehrans awful response to the pandemic As just one example a UNled relief effort would open the door to muchneeded investigations into the conditions of Iranian prisons and the numerous inmates who have been detained on the basis of their disclosures about coronavirus infection rates and deaths These people together with participants in a November mass uprising and various other political prisoners have been left especially vulnerable to COVID19 at a time when outbreaks have been active for weeks in at least a dozen Iranian prisons In a bid to show a gesture of international good will the regime recently announced it planned to release 85000 prisoners in recognition of concerns over coronavirus But this claim is as questionable as the official infection and mortality rates especially given that reports continue to emerge of political prisoners staging hunger strikes writing open letters and even initiating riots in protest over cramped unsanitary conditions and a complete lack of medical care These complaints have haunted international policies toward Iran for many years Amidst the coronavirus outbreak it has become more imperative than ever for Western powers and human rights advocates to address them Yet far too many policymakers have responded to a worsening crisis by demanding even less of the Iranian regime than they already were This is no way to save the Iranian people from the devastation of coronavirus It is certainly no way of alleviating the suffering they have experienced at the hands of their own government Those who are concerned for these people should not offer Tehran money or condemn the American strategy of maximum pressure Rather they should remind Tehran that it can already access goods that will benefit the public and that if the regime is unable to use such resources effectively the international

Gaddafi in 2011 was supposed to herald a new phase of social development and freedom for the country of six million Instead it brought about political and economic instability and plunged Libyans into what many describe as their darkest days Wadah Alkish a young Tripoli resident told Euronews things are really hopeless as Libya now faces a new and invisible threat COVID19 Alkish sent us a few audio messages on Facebook explaining how life has changed since authorities started imposing curfews in different parts of the country and enforced lockdowns to try and halt the spread of coronavirus For people like me who dont get a salary from the government things are really difficult Alkish said He used to do a series of jobs including ridesharing services just like Uber the Uber services in America but not exactly Alkish said His joking tone changed when he described the situation right now Since the curfew started my customers dont call me They dont have anywhere to go So I wasnt able to make any money during the last couple of weeks Residents in the capital also faced electricity and water shortages in the past few days Alkish said People were about to lose their minds I mean no electricity no water only a few hours to go out and get your stuff together you know Lockdown means it is harder to escape the conflict But in Libya those who still have a home to go back to are among the lucky ones Since the fighting reignited last year when General Khalifa Haftar in the east ordered militias in the selfproclaimed Libyan National Army to take control of the capital Tripoli some 200000 Libyans were displaced according to the International Organization for Migration IOM Many of them now live in makeshift shelters schools and gymnasiums turned reception centres in and around Tripoli These conflictstricken families now struggle to meet basic needs from shelter to food water and medical care And are unable to follow social distancing measures due to the inherently crowded nature of these spaces Willem de Jonge the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRCs head of operations for Libya says the tight restrictions on travel have also affected people trying to escape the conflict Restriction of movement as a result of the COVID19 crisis has also impacted the ability for people caught up in the fighting to move to other areas which is a very common thing you see during a conflict internal displacement But if you have curfews in place restriction of movement is an extra challenge that we see de Jonge said UN calls for global ceasefire fall on deaf ears Despite the UNs call for a global ceasefire Libya has yet to see a deescalation in the fighting In fact over the past few weeks we have seen an increase in the internal conflict said de Jonge And the fighting is straining the country is already fragile healthcare system which instead of focusing on preparing for COVID19 is busy treating fighters Traditionally warwounded were sent abroad for treatment for proper healthcare which of course is impossible now because of the travel restrictions So not only do we see an increase in the number of warwounded because theres an increase in fighting but these warwounded are having to be treated in Libya which again puts an extra strain on the health system de Jonge said Even though there are serious efforts being made all over the country to prepare for more COVID19 cases wards being established treatment protocols purchase of PPE personal protective equipment I think this will be a huge challenge Getting humanitarian aid inside Libya was already hard enough because of the constant fighting and different authorities and militias controlling different parts of the country Now that curfews are in place customs only work restricted hours which means aid shipment are taking much longer to be delivered according to de Jonge who said that the situation is inevitably impacting international humanitarian organisations ability to respond quickly We passed the message to both sets of authorities so that they allow for humanitarian aid and personnel to move freely he said Migrants at risk Long before COVID19 emerged as a lifethreatening respiratory disease that brought the entire world to a halt one group of people already experienced extraordinary hardships in Libya According to the International Organization for Migration IOM there are over 600000 refugees and migrants in the country Many are from subSaharan nations who arrived in Libya before the fall of Gaddafi and who are now for the most part seeking to leave the wartorn country despite the pandemic On Wednesday a group of 50 migrants and refugees who had been rescued at sea by a Maltese ship in Maltese waters were taken back to Libya and allowed to disembark in Tripoli From the naval base where they docked authorities took them straight to the infamous detention centres where a large number of asylum seekers are kept Obviously they are in a difficult situation their access to health care is more difficult than that of a Libyan national they will be living in close confinement and many wont be able to carry out the physical distancing that is being advised de Jonge explained While many live among Libyan nationals mostly in poor areas thousands are currently held in detention centres across the country some in facilities operated by the government others in informal jails run by armed groups Very little is known about the living conditions in the militiasrun wards but if the accounts of those who manage to escape them are anything to go by a fullblown epidemic would be impossible to contain in their insalubrious and crowded quarters Migrants and refugees are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion stigma and discrimination particularly when undocumented To avert a catastrophe governments must do all they can to protect the rights and the health of everyone read a joint statement published by the IOM the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCR the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR and the World Health Organization WHO That task may be beyond what Libya can afford to offer right now

coronavirus among the 18 million people displaced across the region by the decadelong Boko Haram insurgency Northeast Nigeria has yet to register any confirmed infections but aid workers fear the virus could rampage through the overcrowded camps a catastrophe for a population already living on the edge Around the regional capital Maiduguri hundreds of thousands are crammed into governmentcontrolled camps or huddled in makeshift shelters at unofficial locations Running water is rare and conditions are often squalid This epidemic is scary we ardently pray against it Aishatu Abubakar a resident of the Bakassi camp housing 30000 people told AFP It is a double calamity we have been grappling with insecurity and now this disease has reared its head Bunu Bukar Muhammad cofounder of local charity Smile Mission Healthcare has been trying to spread the word about coronavirus in the camp setting up facilities and teaching people how to wash their hands correctly But he admits there are major challenges in the crowded conditions Things like social distancing are quite difficult to adopt in this context he told AFP In a bid to prevent infections the local authorities have banned all visitors from entering the camps they control But those living in the informal settlements that stud the city insist that not enough is being done We have not received any aid at all said Umar Gwoza who lives with his family at one of the unofficial sites We are in need of hand gloves face masks and hand sanitiser to protect ourselves More than 10 years of jihadist rebellion has left northeast Nigeria in no state to deal with a global pandemic Only half of the roughly 700 health facilities in Borno state the epicentre of the violence are still working and many have been damaged by the fighting There is no health system to contain that virus and the sick It will spread like wildfire and affect all involved including security said one United Nations worker on condition of anonymity It is really scary Those living in the camps are no strangers to the spread of diseases Cholera has broken out repeatedly and aid workers are falling back on their experience of dealing with other diseases to try to stave off coronavirus But an easily transmitted virus could prove devastating in the camps even if the average age of the population is young For the IDPs internally displaced people if they get infected and need more help they cannot get it the UN worker said Their immune system will be easily compromised because of poor diet and other conditions like poor sanitation and lack of water Their situation could be dire The UN on Tuesday announced it was taking emergency preparedness and response measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus among the most vulnerable people in the northeast That means ensuring supplies of clean water helping to provide soap launching media campaigns on the coronavirus and scrambling to bring in crucial equipment such as ventilators from overseas A medical source told AFP that in Borno state there are currently only 10 ventilators which are needed for patients who are unable to breathe on their own because of lung damage caused by the virus Our priority is to ensure the continuous delivery of lifesaving assistance especially health services Edward Kallon the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria said in a statement More than ever it is crucial for vulnerable people to have access to not only water soap shelters but also food education and protection Beyond the nightmare scenario of a major outbreak in the camps humanitarian organisations worry that global disruptions from the pandemic could soon hit efforts to reach the 71 million people in desperate need of assistance Nigeria which by Thursday had confirmed 174 infections and 2 deaths from the novel coronavirus has closed its borders and shut down international flights The government says humanitarian assistance will still get in and has pledged to provide those displaced with two months of food rations But aid workers are concerned that the virus could see tighter official controls donor funds going elsewhere and problems bringing in

Yangon and president of the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences FABC released a public statement blaming the despotic Chinese Communist Party CCP for the worldwide Covid19 crisis According to him the CCP is solely responsible for the current pandemic and all the suffering it generates Thus there is not a strong enough word to explain how the CCP is a threat to the world A few days later I received messages from Chinese Catholics shocked by the statement Although they were not claiming that their government was perfect they felt humiliated as citizens and as Catholics Sharing their feelings I have invited them to directly respond to the various media outlets which publicized Cardinal Bos statement I hope that the words of laypeople will be as welcome as the bellicose declaration of the cardinal As a French theologian and an anthropologist studying the Church in China I feel obliged to speak up as well Indeed Cardinal Bos statement is not only inaccurate but is also dangerously political and surprisingly divisive Here I explain why I believe this statement was a mistake and does not reflect what Catholics could expect from an archbishop with such responsibilities and titles First the statement was inaccurate Cardinal Bo claims that the CCP lied so much that the rest of the world was kept in ignorance and led to a catastrophe But in fact reliable information was available early in February and yet the West dismissed it For instance Science Magazine a toplevel academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science has regularly published articles about Covid19 and provided a significant amount of data and warnings By the end of January contributors were already clear every country must prepare for a pandemic Multiple scenarios were still possible but by Feb 25 contributors were certain the world was already in the middle of a pandemic This does not prove that the CCP has not lied I do not have the means to verify such a claim But this shows that while consistent information about the virus was piling up Western governments refused to take them seriously As a French citizen I witnessed our government is spokesperson repeatedly explaining that this virus is just like the flu facial masks do not help and this virus affects only old people On March 6 French President Emmanuel Macron even insisted on going to the theater to demonstrate that normal life should go on Then for several weeks the French government refused to count people dying inside homes for the elderly limiting the official death toll to those who departed at hospital Thus I agree with Cardinal Bo that lies and propaganda have put millions of lives around the world in danger But we need to enlarge the scope of our inquiry While South Korea Taiwan Hong Kong and Vietnam were extremely careful about the virus and able to handle it it is in southern Europe that it has run wild Many sociocultural and economic reasons may explain why the crisis directly jumped from China to Europe without disrupting Hong Kong Taiwan and Vietnam first But we cannot turn a blind eye to the lies and denial of Western politicians As far as I know it is not the CCP who forced the West to go for an untenable herd immunity policy despite all the information we had This brings me to my second point Cardinal Bos unilateral statement was dangerously political By putting all the blame without nuance nor evidence on the CCP he indirectly takes side in the USChina conflict His letter is filled with binary antagonism dividing the world into two camps Unsurprisingly but sadly many understood this controversial statement as an indication of the support of the Catholic Church for those calling for a crusade against China But how can an eminent figure of the Church an institution committed to meet and talk to everyone embrace such a divisive position This brings me to my third point Cardinal Bo calls for unity against the CCP by advocating a problematic distinction between the Chinese nation and its current regime According to the president of the FABC we could inconsequently oppose China a great and ancient civilization that has contributed so much to the world throughout history and its criminal regime While I agree that every nation cannot be reduced to the policy of its current government I would not support the archbishop of Yangon in his efforts to oppose the two Insulting the Chinese regime is also spitting in the face of the nation which supports it His divisive narrative dangerously echoes political enterprises of the 19th and 20th centuries which claimed moral superiority and humanitarian motivations to overthrow foreign regimes and rule their populations Have we already forgotten what happened in Iraq Libya and Latin America A final point must be made By the end of his letter Cardinal Bo calls for compensation As a minimum it the CCP should write off the debts of other countries to cover the cost of Covid19 Indeed over the past few weeks various religious and political leaders have spoken about this problem of debt payments for the poorest countries And as Pope Francis and the G20 have recently illustrated this complex issue requires multilateral agreement and diplomacy not some kind of gunboat diplomacy targeting only one creditor This does not honor the Church In conclusion I can only reiterate the shared disappointment that some Chinese Catholics and I felt with such a statement As recent sex scandals have reminded us highlevel church officials must be exemplary and accountable It is not enough to talk about love vulnerability and truth while releasing a statement filled with inaccuracy partisanship and offensiveness Michel Chambon is a French theologian and

repeatedly sounded the alarm that the situation on the Greek islands deteriorated by Turkeys move to open its borders in March is a tinderbox waiting to ignite A possible coronavirus outbreak could decimate already vulnerable asylum seekers crammed in the reception and identification centres around the Aegean The European Parliament has joined NGOs in calling on Greece to immediately decongest the refugee camps and protect people trapped on the Greek islands On the island of Lesvos alone almost 20000 people including people with disabilities chronic illnesses the elderly and families with children are living in conditions that are far from humane facing an uncertain future in facilities made for less than 3000 We know that the virus thrives in locations where populations live in close quarters with limited access to sanitation Imagine the reality for refugees and asylum seekers in Moria Greece where there are a staggering 203800 people per km2 according to the IRCs analysis with as many as 1300 sharing a single water tap in some parts of the camp Europeans are staying at home cleaning their home washing themselves not going to crowded places But here We have to stand in line for food We have to stand in line to shower And these lines are really crowded I see so many old people in those lines and it makes me feel really sad because I know that if coronavirus comes most of them will die says 24yearold RA from Afghanistan one of the beneficiaries of our psychosocial programme on the island of Lesvos There is no doubt that overcrowding in the camps needs to be dealt with immediately but the question remains how to do so effectively amidst a Europewide collective lockdown While the first attempt to use empty hotels for quarantining a thousand of the most vulnerable migrants on the Greek islands has just been announced by the European Commission more remains to be done Empty hotels are a problem but can also be a solution Greece entered lockdown in early March with all hotels and tourist accommodation ordered to close from 15 March until 30 April with a possibility of a further extension For hotel owners and their staff it is a recipe for yet another disaster that the hospitality sector will need to face headon With over 38000 tourist accommodation establishments including hotels hostels rooms for rent and over 1340000 bed places this means a severe blow for the Greek economy Ιn 2019 a quarter of Greeces GDP came from tourism which employed 411000 people As EU member states struggle with COVID19 exit strategies potential travel restrictions in the following months remain a great unknown Hotel owners and employees all over Greece are rightly concerned about their businesses with the uncertainty of the upcoming tourist season looming At the same time thousands of refugees on the Greek islands are concerned about their survival as they cannot isolate and protect themselves from COVID19 Facilitating refugee access to vacant accommodation on the islands and establishing a fair payment scheme for the owners under available EU funds is a solution that can benefit both refugees and locals Back in winter 2016 in the wake of severe snowfalls in Greece this solution saved many lives Last week the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR launched a call for a tendering process for refugee accommodation on the respective islands aiming to provide people with safe shelter for a period of three months Given the obvious benefits this solution would bring to the Greek businesses we are counting on the hotel owners to respond positively to this call A similar model is already being used in several European cities such as Brussels where an empty hotel was turned into a safe shelter for homeless people or Madrid with a resort hosting refugees during the ongoing coronavirus crisis However hotels can serve only as a temporary fix What refugees and asylumseekers need in the long run are solutions accepted by the local communities ensuring that they can find themselves in dignified settings that promote their integration psychological wellbeing and give them a chance to gain control of their own futures These should be boldly promoted far beyond the current emergency to avoid the scenario of overcrowding dire living conditions and deadly risks currently seen on the Greek islands from repeating itself anytime in the future The European Commission has just announced the expansion of a financial package for emergency support for refugee integration and accommodation which means fresh hope for people languishing on the islands And as shown by the International Rescue Committee is own experience in running a supported living programme for unaccompanied children in Athens providing refugees with proper accommodation and personalised support is an approach that works Transferring people out of camps and investing in alternative models of accommodation including apartments or supporting hotels to host the evacuees is not only a powerful act of solidarity with refugees but also a lifeline to a nowstruggling hospitality sector and Greek people severely affected by this crisis But whatever steps are implemented now to fight COVID19 they should constitute part of the solution to permanently address the humanitarian crisis in Greece which started long before the coronavirus dominated the headlines The pandemic has not created the need for more humane conditions or decongestion of the reception centres It has exposed however how the void left by a lack of coordinated EU response to the situation on the Greek islands painfully impacts the most vulnerable populations within Europes borders in the wake of a sudden health crisis Dimitra Kalogeropoulou is the Greece Country Director at

African countries are overwhelmed A lack of personal protective equipment difficulties in establishing treatment centres and an absence of critical care facilities might lead to a devastating loss of life Most of the countries have at least one treatment centre but they range from some with less than 10 beds to some of them with 100 beds said Michel Yao emergency operations manager for Africa at the World Health Organisation WHO The latest readiness assessments by 34 African countries collated by WHO paints a bleak picture of preparedness for the pandemic as the number of cases and deaths rise Only 50 per cent of African countries surveyed had undertaken any Covid19 staff training for case management and just over half the countries had personal protection equipment PPE available and accessible to healthcare workers according to WHO readiness response sheets Preparations on the African continent need to be quickly scaled up as patient capacity will soon be challenged Yao told RFI in a telephone interview Treatment capacity is linked to the availability of PPE and equipment yet these items are just not available in Africa and the international market is already saturated with demand from much richer countries International transportation is also a challenge with cargo space reduced by airlines stopping their services to the African continent Medical humanitarian organisations like Médecins Sans Frontières Doctors Without Borders hope that transmission of the virus in Africa can be slowed by measures such as hand washing and perhaps maskwearing according to Natalie Roberts who works for MSF in Nigeria The time to act is now but such initiatives need considerable resources like soap distributions and hand washing stations according to Roberts It could potentially be catastrophic said the MSF doctor discussing the increasing spread of cases She said the only other hope is the fact that many African countries have a younger demographic and Covid19 appears to cause more fatalities in the elderly Critical care difficult or impossible Scaling up the response to the coronavirus pandemic as seen in Asia Europe or North America would be extremely difficult on the African continent according to Javed Ali director of the emergency response unit for International Medical Corps A lack of resources complicates setting up isolation wards or treatment centres for coronavirus according to Ali And providing critical care to those suffering from the most severe cases of Covid19 is just not going to be possible Dealing with patients who require Level 3 ICU or critical care is going to be extremely difficult and in some countries it is going to be completely impossible Ali told RFI Level 3 care is defined as having to support two or more organs or providing mechanical ventilation to aid breathing Some African countries simply do not have the ventilators required for the severe respiratory problems Covid19 can cause Interational Medical Corps will instead focus on providing Level 1 care which includes providing basic oxygen or intravenous therapy It is a view echoed by MSF doctor Roberts who also works on emergency management for health crises Intensive care is just not there and it is just not accessible to people said Roberts explaining that some of those patients saved by critical care interventions in Europe and elsewhere will simply die in countries like Nigeria How many ICU beds does Africa have The responses by African health ministries to WHO is Covid19 readiness survey provides a sometimes confusing outlook of the actual ICU resources available as few repositories actually map the critical care facilities at various hospitals across the continent One such study in 2015 by three Canadian researchers entitled Intensive Care Unit Capacity in LowIncome Countries A Systematic Review reveals the underfunded and underresourced nature of African healthcare systems as seen through the number of ICU beds Many African countries had less than two dozen ICU beds to cover their entire population Capacity has somewhat increased since 2015 with Kenya claiming more than 500 critical care beds according to The Standard newspaper and some 120 ICU beds in Nigeria according to a 2017 report by the McKinsey management consultancy firm Nevertheless this pales in comparison with other regions across the world especially in light of the care required for severe Covid19 cases According to WHO is readiness survey for Covid19 countries such as Angola Burkina Faso Burundi Central African Republic Cote dIvoire Congo Brazzaville Guinea Bissau Lesotho Malawi Mali Mozambique Niger Sao Tome and Principe Seychelles South Sudan and Zimbabwe have no ICU beds available to treat Covid19 It is not entirely clear whether the responses to WHO is surveys by African governments include both public and private hospitals The total ICU capacity is also not included as a survey question and neither is the number of ICU beds currently occupied Not enough specialised healthcare workers The grim reality of critical care in African countries is not just about unavailable supplies or machines It is also a question of human resources the skills and experience of staff running the hospitals and ICUs according to nurse Cliff Asher Aliga who teaches at Aga Khan University Hospital in Kampala Uganda We are not wellprepared in term of ICU and that is a very big concern for me Aliga told RFI If the situation requires five per cent of patients who are going to have Covid19 to be admitted to ICU we definitely do not have the capacity to do that that is a very big challenge Uganda has 55 functioning ICU beds according to a 2019 study by researchers from Makerere University However the required number of specialists has not kept pace with the number of beds said Aliga Healthcare facilities do not have enough anaesthesiologists for those 55 beds Staff training for dealing with Covid19 case management in Uganda is still in its infancy but is taking place according to Aliga who is president of the African Federation of Critical Care Nurses Ugandan health authorities have a plan in place designating certain hospitals for coronavirus patients and using a taskforce to transport cases to reduce the risk of infection Yet healthcare workers in Uganda are already starting to feel the pressure with an inadequate supply of PPE and heightened tension in hospitals said Aliga describing the potential for a large number of severe cases and an unpredictable situation We are now relying on hope that things do not get like that but in the event that things get like that I do not even have the words to describe what is likely to happen the specialist nurse added Experts from medical humanitarian organisations are also pinning their hopes on the possibility that the spread of the pandemic could play out differently in Africa Severity of coronavirus in Africa International Medical Corps is focusing its Covid19 efforts in Cameroon Chad Democratic Republic of Congo Ethiopia Libya Nigeria and South Sudan Javed Ali said it is difficult to predict whether the intensity of the outbreak is going to be the same as seen elsewhere A more dispersed population in some countries environmental factors the level of poverty as well as extended family living together are all elements that could make the spread of Covid19 in Africa either less potent or actually worsen it according to Ali The rainy season in West Africa coupled with increased food insecurity and malnutrition and the prevalence of other diseases could complicate the infection to severity ratio compared to other regions said the International Medical Corps emergency response director Dr Nathalie Roberts from MSF is sceptical that lockdowns in African countries will be respected and will not otherwise cause further harm describing how stopping families from earning money will make it even harder for them to feed themselves She also believes that lockdowns in Africa are not sustainable and could lead to civil unrest further complicating efforts to contain Covid19 In places like Nigeria testing is only available in big cities like Lagos and Abuja and isolating people who have been infected yet do not exhibit symptoms or feel unwell is just not practical the MSF doctor added Ensuring that people do not die from other conditions while dealing with the coronavirus is also likely to be a challenge said Michel Yao from WHO when the system is overwhelmed you have some difficult choices to be made The resources for critical care are few and far between but even the necessary supplies for providing oxygen therapy require considerable capacity according to the WHO expert Many African countries are going to have to rely on nongovernmental organisations and donor countries to try and scale up their responses If you do not really have a health system then flattening the curve is just trying to avoid too many deaths at the same time said MSF is Roberts referring to how some Western governments have described measures to curb the spread of Covid19 Because it is really unacceptable socially and politically to have people dying in the streets More videos available on Radio France Internationale All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved

beginning of the coronavirus outbreak with experts warning they could hamper efforts to curb the virus Doctored photos and fabricated news articles crafted by conspiracy theorists shared thousands of times on social media platforms and messaging apps in various languages have gone as far as accusing the Microsoft founder of creating the outbreak Gates who has pledged 250 million to efforts to fight the pandemic is the latest in a string of online targets despite the World Health Organization is efforts to fight what it called an infodemic misinformation fanned by panic and confusion about the virus In recent months 5G networks and HungarianAmerican billionaire George Soros have also been blamed for creating COVID19 which has killed more than 315000 people around the world Bill Gates has always been a target of specific conspiracy communities said Rory Smith research manager at First Draft a nonprofit that provides research and training for journalists Gates whose eponymous foundation has spent billions of dollars improving healthcare in developing countries over the past 20 years has become a kind of abstract boogeyman said Whitney Phillips an assistant professor at New York is Syracuse University where she teaches digital ethics A video accusing Gates of wanting to eliminate 15 percent of the population through vaccination and electronic microchips has racked up nearly two million views on YouTube Similar allegations exploded between January and April Smith told AFP Exploiting the crisis Since the start of the crisis AFP Fact Check has debunked dozens of antiGates rumours circulating on platforms like Facebook WhatsApp and Instagram in languages including English French Spanish Polish and Czech A number of accusations including posts claiming that the FBI arrested Gates for biological terrorism or that he supports a Western plot to poison Africans share a common thread They accuse the tycoon of exploiting the crisis whether it is to control people or make money from selling vaccines These conspiracies are powerful enough to drive down institutional trust around health organisations and as a result possibly drive down vaccination rates which is worrying Smith said Gates vocal criticism of US President Donald Trump and support for vaccine development made him the perfect scapegoat for a crisis that emerges on the intersection of technology and medical science Kinga PolynczukAlenius a social sciences researcher at Finland is University of Helsinki wrote in a university blog post It is not the first time Gates has found himself at the mercy of conspiracy theorists When Zika virus broke out in 2015 in Brazil he was one of several powerful Western figures blamed for the disease Other rumours claim that he is secretly a lizard an old favourite among online trolls He has not become conspiracists favourite target he has been their favourite target for a long time Sylvain Delouvee a social psychology researcher at France is University of Rennes told AFP Predicted the pandemic The recent explosion in false claims could be explained as a coping mechanism during the global crisis Smith said People are constantly looking for information to make sense out of this reality and having these conspiracies offers a convenient way of having power over your situation he said The pandemic has also provided fertile breeding ground for attacks on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation particularly by antivaccine campaigners whose influential online presence was already brewing years before the virus emerged The charity is humanitarian work in Africa where misinformation about Gates is particularly present and financial support of the World Health Organization it is the agency is secondlargest donor have fed rumours of dark secrets and ploys for power Several widely shared posts point to photographs of Gates attending a coronavirus conference in 2015 Conclusion He predicted the pandemic In reality he was meeting with a research institute that had filed for a patent to potentially be used for a vaccine against a different type of coronavirus that affects animals Like many scientists Gates had already warned of an imminent pandemic in the years before the novel coronavirus outbreak Conspiracies creeping into mainstream Gates has also come under attack from celebrities Conservative US television host Laura Ingraham claimed in an interview that Gates was developing tracking mechanisms She was referring to a widely misinterpreted Reddit post by the billionaire about digital certificates to show who has recovered been tested or eventually vaccinated Robert Kennedy Jr the antiTrump antivaccine nephew of the former American president John F Kennedy has accused the philanthropist of dictating global health policies Meanwhile French Chocolat actress Juliette Binoche sparked controversy when she posted an Instagram post blasting Gates and calling for the rejection of a microchip implant for all Debunking misinformation is not about saying that everyone is a good guy said Delouvee at France is University of Rennes pointing to privacy concerns around the race to build coronavirus tracking apps and governments use of medical data The Gates Foundation has come under fire in publications such as The Lancet medical journal which accused it of a lack of transparency over its financial

the most remote places are trying to protect themselves Just like the rest of the world the Sahrawi refugee camps located a few kilometers from Tindouf southern Algeria are battling against COVID19 Sahrawi refugees who have been living in the middle of the Algerian desert for 45 years are facing a new kind isolation amid this global pandemic Because they lack medical staff and health care material any coronavirus case reaching their communities could cause a catastrophe The borders with Algeria and Mauritania have been closed since 19 March by order of the Polisario Front a liberation movement at the head of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Movements between settlements called wilayas have been limited in and around the camps The 16th edition of the Sahara International Film Festival which aims to give visibility to the conflict through cinema has been postponed Several public events including the Holidays in Peace program thanks to which hundreds of children spend their summer in Spain have been cancelled While millions of people around the world have adopted the motto StayAtHome the Sahrawis apply their own StayInYourTent Some rituals like teamaking are maintained but held with extreme precautions hands and glasses are washed more often even though water is a scarce commodity in the Saharan desert The Sahrawis are aware that following distancing measures is essential to prevent the appearance and multiplication of positive coronavirus cases in a place with such rudimentary infrastructure Abdala Banani Saaid a Saharawi doctor told Euronews that health personnel have very few protective equipment just 600 pairs of gloves and 2000 masks for a population of between 180000 and 200000 people All the doctors who work abroad are helping but right now no health center is really ready Even the national hospital does not have respiratory equipment Abdala said There have been no reports of coronavirus cases in the Sahrawi refugee camps so far Two suspects detected have tested negative which was a relief for the population Abdala fears cases could still declare themselves Let is hope we do not get any case because we really do not have anything here he said Confined for more than four decades Having lived in confinement for 45 years the Saharawi refugees know very well what isolation from the outside world feels like They were exiled from Western Sahara a former Spanish colony after Moroccan occupied the territory Many of them were forced to flee to the Algerian desert where they built one of the largest and oldest refugee camps in the world Their daily life is made of food and water shortages as well as high temperatures Faced with a health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic managing scarce resources would be even more complicated The price of the few products that can be purchased in the camps has already increased affecting the most vulnerable families Added to this situation is the fear of seeing further reduced humanitarian aid which has already been cut in recent years The Sahrawi people say they fear that the international organizations to which they have long been subjected and whose management they often criticise may abandon them due to the pandemic Despite everything they claim draw strength by taking refuge in their religion We are aware that our means are humble Salima a young Saharawi told Euronews Our ability to cope with this virus is limited but our hope is in God We are a people of fighters who have come out of more difficult things so we will surely know how to get out of this with the same force Saharawi families once again separated The socalled Wall of Shame is a barrier built by the Moroccan Army that separates occupied Western Sahara from liberated territories On the other side of the wall thousands of Sahrawis are adapting like the rest of Moroccan citizens to the prevention measures decreed by the Kingdom of Morocco On the night of 20 March Rabat enforced a state of sanitary emergency and restricted the movement of people In Dakhla a coastal city in the socalled occupied territories Moroccan settlers panicked at the threat of COVID19 Five days later despite the ban more than 1200 Moroccans left the city As of 9 April Morocco has registered 1346 coronavirus cases and 96 deaths have been registered The Sahrawi side however has been willing to accept confinement in the cities of occupied Sahara despite the fact that many of them have their family and livestock in the desert due to their Bedouin tradition Police controls in the area further complicate the transit of the Sahrawis Many Sahrawi citizens who were abroad were prevented from joining their families in the occupied territories Sidi Ahmed Lyadasi president of the NGO Adala UK explained to Euronews The Moroccan authorities have not provided any means of transport or exceptionally opened the air border as most countries have done he said As Mohamed Mayara coordinator of the independent information portal Équipe Média explained to Euronews there is complete distrust of the Moroccan regime in the camps The Sahrawis living in the area have been under Moroccan rule since 1975 They routinely denounce the discrimination they suffer in the form of running water cuts telephone surveillance and even persecution illegal detentions and torture The conflict in Western Sahara is one of the open wounds of African colonisation When Spain withdrew from this territory in 1975 Morocco and Mauritania divided the region and Mauritania left the territory four years later Then began the war between Morocco and the Polisario Front and the flow of Sahrawi refugees started pouring into camps in Tindouf Algeria In a health crisis of this caliber the differences between Moroccans and Sahrawis could widen Mohamed Mayara said citing the case of a young Saharawi Hammadi El Kaihel employed in a Moroccan business in the city of Esmara who has reported an episode of racial discrimination When the company published the list of beneficiaries of the coronavirus aid their name was not included Mayara explained According to the coordinator of Équipe Média the socalled separatists Sahrawi proindependence groups and human rights activists cannot access health services either since Morocco considers that they have no right as long as they continue to criticise the regime he said Morocco is health system is ranked 89 in a list of 93 countries according to the worldwide Numbeo database Should the situation in Western Sahara worsen due to the

cities for their villages over the past few days Critics blame Prime Minister Narendra Modis hasty 21day curfew call that like many of his recent directives was long on populist symbolism but short on foresight or compassion It was the biggest human lockdown ordered at the shortest notice without adequate planning or preparation for the fallout of a sweeping policy measure that was weeks in the making In a televised address to the nation at 8pm on Tuesday March 24 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi put 13 billion people under a threeweek lockdown It was the worlds largest coronavirus directive not even China the worlds most populous country and source of the Covid19 outbreak imposed such a sweeping nationwide shutdown with Beijing isolating only the worstaffected Hubei province The time frame was breathlessly tight the measures would start at midnight Modi announced giving his people less than four hours to stock up and disregard earlier directives to avoid hoarding The scenes that unfolded in the worlds most populous democracy in the days to come were reminiscent of postwar neorealist cinema or subcontinental Partition dramas based on historys biggest human displacement following the 1947 division of British India Millions of migrant workers from Indias vast informal sector attempted to leave cities where many simply live on work sites that were shutting down for their villages With no jobs homes savings social security or ability to earn daily wages in cities the village offered the only chance of survival But public transportation was shut down under Modis vague emotionally charged but detailfree curfew order State borders closed Supply chains in the absence of emergency measures ground to a halt stalling the entry of food and essential goods With no access to food or transportation Indias urban poor took to the streets walking to distant villages in a flood of human misery More than 20 migrant labourers have died trying to walk to their villages over the past few days The democratic state not only abandoned them its law enforcement arm viciously cracked down on homeless civilians disregarding stay at home orders My conscience says you will forgive me As social media lit up with clips of police brutality Modi was forced to take to the airwaves again Days after ordering the lockdown the Indian prime minister apologised to the country in a radio address I would firstly like to seek forgiveness from all my countrymen began Modi before declaring my conscience says you will forgive me Populist apology out of the way the Indian leader then explained the coronavirus crisis was a battle of life and death and he did not have other options The mea culpa failed to impress Harsh Mander director of the New Delhibased Centre for Equity Studies and a leading Indian social activist and author I dont think the apology amounted to an acknowledgment of the enormity of what has been done and there were no correctives offered The entire plan had the imagination of a middleclass person people were asked to maintain social distance wash their hands and stay home assuming they have homes and salaries going into bank accounts said Mander in a phone interview with FRANCE 24 Policies directed to protect the rich and middle class A cursory glance at Indian economic statistics reveals this is not the case Nearly 81 percent of the Indian labour force works in the informal sector according to the International Labour Organisation ILO Casual labourers account for onethird of the work force according to the Indian Ministry of Labour and Employment with vendors construction workers domestics and a vast array of other lowskilled workers surviving on daily wages with no labour protection India has 1238 confirmed coronavirus cases and 35 deaths according to the latest tally although the real figure is likely to be higher since testing is not widespread Experts agree that the Indian government needed to implement restriction measures Given the countrys poverty population density and poor public services it was not expected to be easy But critics say the authorities had enough time and resources to avoid a lethally mismanaged lockdown I would be willing to live with any difficulty thats equally shared by victims But you cant have policies directed to protect the rich and middle class on the backs of the intense suffering of the poor said Mander If it was collectively planned this could have been better coordinated he added noting for instance that the Modi administration did not even alert the chief ministers of Indias states and union territories who had to bear the brunt of the responsibility about the upcoming curfew The coronavirus crisis is plunging the world into an economic recession with inequalities set to deepen and vulnerable countries left to absorb the financial shock India an emerging market is not alone in feeling the economic pain But as an emerging economy with an extensive administrative service experienced in disaster management it should not rank among the least prepared to cope On Sunday as Modi was apologising for the mismanagement Benins President Patrice Talon took to the airwaves to explain why he would not be imposing similar confinement measures Rich countries are putting up huge amounts of money and some are even resorting to barely disguised monetary solutions said Talon Benin does not have such meansIf we take measures which starve everybody they will quickly end up being defied and violated The crux of the problem in India according to veteran journalist Sidharth Bhatia lies in the Modi administrations peremptory decision making lack of planning and shoddy execution Theres another added Bhatia in a column in The Wire the complete lack of concern over the human cost which has been colossal Since he came to power in 2014 Modi has opted for shock announcements with little preparedness that have left the populace scrambling to cope with the fallout humanitarian and economic of his populist moves On November 8 2016 for instance the prime minister made a surprise evening television appearance to announce that starting after midnight the nations 500 and 1000rupee notes would be demonetised or no longer considered legal tender Economists estimate the move wiped at least one percent off Indias GDP and cost at least 15 million jobs Then on August 5 2019 Modi suddenly scrapped Kashmirs statehood and special status plunging the disputed region into a communications blackout and human rights crackdown that drew international criticism By the end of the year his rushedthrough citizenship amendment measures sparked demonstrations across the country with protesters denouncing the rightwing Hindu nationalist leaders antiMuslim policies With such a pattern of decision making the obvious question is doesnt anyone in the Modi government and Narendra Modi himself consider the human cost of such decisions asked Bhatia The imperious firman or royal edict like proclamations may appeal to him it certainly pleases his devotees but surely he would have thought about the suffering it causes Economic package too little too late In the aftermath of the latest Modi shock move as international media organisations and human rights groups detailed the extent of the upheaval Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman hastily announced a 226 billion economic package that provides direct cash transfers and food security measures We do not want anyone to remain hungry Sitharaman told a news briefing on Thursday While welcoming the announcement experts noted that the measures should have been announced before the lockdown to prevent the panicked flight of migrants at bus stops and railway stations which exacerbated public health risks In an open letter to the finance minister more than 600 academics economists policy analysts and civil society members detailed the shortfalls including meagre allocations and inadequate disbursement mechanisms to reach vulnerable sections of the population who fall through the cracks of the countrys public distribution system PDS and antipoverty programmes since they lack necessary documents Noting that the monthly cash allocations amount to less than two days of Indias statutory minimum wages the equivalent of less than 5 per month Mander who was also one of the signatories to the letter explained Thats expecting the poor to manage if at all on two days salary And thats only for the ones with bank accounts The rest are just being asked to be obedient In a March 31 oped in The Hindu daily activists Nikhil Dey and Aruna Roy a former Indian civil servant criticised the government for not releasing food stocks to handle the emergency There is no excuse for hoarding the 58 million tonnes of current food grains stock when only four million tonnes are required by the PDS every month wrote Dey and Roy Castigating the Modi administrations contradictory and uncoordinated orders Dey and Roy blasted the response of Indias government and its elites This lockdown is shaping itself as the expedient response of an elite terrified of falling victim to a virus There is clearly little imagination or application to work out a plan of action based on compassion and understanding of conditions on the ground This virus upends the sharp divide of the two Indias we have manufactured the activists noted A fear psychosis over a silent killer virus has also sparked backlashes against familiar and unfamiliar bogeys Foreign tourists and residents in the traditionally warm welcoming country have reported a sudden hostility from locals who view the epidemic as an outside import In some villages and neighbourhoods in Goa a popular tourist destination vigilante groups have set up makeshift checkpoints refusing entry to nonresidents The Wire reported Then there are the familiar punchingbags Indian news headlines over the past two days have been dominated by a Muslim religious event that began late February in New Delhi which set off several Covid19 clusters Hours after the news broke this week the hashtag CoronaJihad went viral in the Indian Twittersphere with some suggesting the epidemic was coordinated by Indias archenemy Pakistan and China Vigilantism Islamophobia and police brutality have been on the rise and on public display during Modis second term in office with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party BJP stoking Hindu nationalism amid plummeting economic indices Read more on India is cow urine fake cures against coronavirus The Covid19 pandemic threatens to unleash old responses to new fears warns Mander Police treat poor people trying to survive as though they are criminals because thats how theyre encouraged to think about them Even the middle classes are stigmatising them for spreading the virus The worst in society is emerging because the leadership is not leading with compassion explained Mander But the epidemic has also sparked extraordinary acts of charity and social mobilisation to aid Indians stranded and destitute by the lockdown Mander is among several Indian activists NGO and professionals stirred by the crisis who have been offering free meals to stranded migrants in Indian cities Speaking to FRANCE 24 from a vehicle carrying hot meals bound for another cluster of migrant labourers in New Delhi Mander praised the young people young volunteers who are taking risks to feed the destitute He is currently planning to expand the initiative to 10 other cities and reach thousands more vulnerable people But he is at pains to explain this initiative like several charity initiatives across India is just a bandaid not a solution This is not an issue that can be dealt with by charities Its a step but you cant just say let civil society look after it Its not like Indias poor are a fraction of the population said Mander Its the states duty what were doing is just a tiny fraction of what needs to be done

Europe was having to deal with the border crisis with Turkey a humanitarian crisis in Syria a civil war in Libya keeping Russia at bay and responding to instability and terrorism in the Sahel At the same time Europeans were scratching their heads about how to deal with President Trumps America First strategy There was a little thing called Brexit too Of course none of these problems have gone away and they will remain regardless of how many future waves of COVID19 appear Several commentators believe that these issues are nothing in comparison to the epochal changes we are about to face because of the pandemic Many are already talking about the end of or at the very least a reconfiguration of globalisation Linked to this assumption is the idea that strategic competition between the US and China will likely intensify as both states try to readjust their economies while exercising a form of social distancing in strategic terms With this reading it is as if the horses of plague and conquest are already upon us Yet Newtons laws of motion may help us to at least frame what might be around the corner On the one hand there are centripetal trends that might be aggravated and give rise to security concerns a lot sooner than they might otherwise have been expected On the other centrifugal forces may result in unexpected problems such as the collapse of regimes and governments civil unrest and even war Europe needs to be prepared for all of these events COVID19 shows that we no longer have the luxury of saying big events may never happen There may be some comfort in knowing that even before the pandemic the European Union was already beginning to take its strategic autonomy more seriously in areas like defence currency and technology However COVID19 emphasises the necessity of European solutions to crossborder crises This crisis may call for a bold step forward in EU integration underpinned by treaty change but it may equally result in governments seeking solace in the seemingly comfortable albeit insufficient bosom of national sovereignty What about the other two horsemen war and famine As of today it seems likely that the EU will emerge from the pandemic before Africa and the Middle East As Europe implements its economic stimulus package there will be neighbouring countries that simply lack the medical and sanitation infrastructure to flatten the curve They will lack the financial resources to kick start their economies too Many in the EUs wider neighbourhood are already stricken by war conflict and the aggravating effects of climate change The crisis could lead to greater poverty and exploitation The migration crisis could be exacerbated too and put additional strain on Europes southern states The perfect storm of the pandemic war and human trafficking is already upon us in Libya Populists inside and outside of the EU may well seize on this issue too Furthermore despite historically low oil prices the virus could nonetheless significantly damage global food supply chains and undermine muchneeded statebacked food subsidies in the poorest countries Any fresh or aggravated instability in Europes near and wider neighbours obviously needs to be avoided This is why in April a package of 20 billion was put together to support the EUs most vulnerable neighbours The French President Emmanuel Macron has also spoken about debt relief for Africa Beyond money however we should expect calls for greater EU support with police and military advice and logistical medical support to intensify The EU is already on the ground in places such as the Sahel and the Horn of Africa EU personnel in Mali have even contracted the virus Yet COVID19 could require the mobilisation of different capacities such as the airlifting of medical equipment to vulnerable countries the setting up of mobile field hospitals or sharing best practices on how to manage countrywide lockdowns Fortunately the EU is uniquely wellplaced to handle these tasks given its more than 20 years worth of the experience in deploying civil development humanitarian diplomatic and military tools in vulnerable countries and regions Yet in dealing with the four horsemen of the Apocalypse the EU will be up against a number of difficulties For example European assistance to Africa will be deployed alongside China who have the resources and a desire to make amends for being the country where the outbreak began This will not make aid coordination on the ground any easier especially as the EU has already warned that medical aid could be instrumentalised for propaganda purposes Partnerships with NATO the UN Japan South Korea and others will be essential in upholding a genuine multilateral approach to the crisis that beckons in Africa However perhaps the most worrying challenge facing European security right now is rooted in the continents economic recovery Even though the EU put a number of tools in place in 2016 to enhance security and defence cooperation years of underinvestment in defence capabilities have taken their toll In this regard national approaches will not help Europe and with Permanent Structured Cooperation and the European Defence Fund there is no need to reinvent the wheel Governments just need to invest in European cooperation its that simple Europes armed forces are playing a heroic role at home and the way they have repatriated citizens and delivered medical equipment has been truly extraordinary Yet the looming economic recovery may take its toll on Europes armed forces and civilian experts they will be expected to do more with less money This has to be avoided at all costs Without wellresourced and motivated civil and military actors the four horsemen of the Apocalypse could

a single topic what the coronavirus means for Ethiopia The questions come from across the country as farmers in remote regions ask how they should prepare and in some cases whether the virus is even real The answers come from even farther afield That is because Mehret has taken to stacking his guest list with Ethiopian doctors based abroad often in countries like the United States that have been hit much harder by the pandemic We are still in the precrisis phase so I think learning from them would help a lot Mehret a UStrained psychiatrist said of his diaspora guests We do not know what the crisis will be like The World Bank says Ethiopia has just one doctor for every 10000 people a ratio that is half of neighbouring Kenya is four times lower than Nigeria is and nine times lower than South Africa is But the global response to the pandemic has benefited from the work of Ethiopian doctors overseas including aides to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who is himself Ethiopian though not a doctor and emergencyroom physicians in hotspots like New York Mehret is show is part of a broader effort to enlist those doctors to help shape the local response Just 250 cases of COVID19 the disease caused by the coronavirus have been confirmed so far in Ethiopia but experts warn the health system could easily become overwhelmed by a major surge That is the worstcase scenario said Dr Wubrest Tesfaye Mehret is cohost Having firsthand experience from a person who is at the front responding to the highest outbreak crisis would give us the right kind of information on how to prepare The view from New York It was late March when Tsion Firew an Ethiopian emergencyroom doctor based in Manhattan realised the pandemic could be as bad as anything shed seen in her years of responding to conflicts and humanitarian disasters Critical patients just kept coming and the lack of information about the virus elevated fear and anxiety I actually felt like I was back in Mosul she recalled referring to her time in the Iraqi city after it was liberated from the Islamic State group in 2017 She talked about her experiences on a recent episode of Mehret is show a segment Mehret said helped underscore the gravity of the virus for listeners Tsion is time in New York the worstaffected US city has also informed her work on an Ethiopian government task force to fight the virus which she does in the mornings before hospital shifts When she disagrees with Ethiopian officials like when she thought they were moving too slowly to procure testing materials she pushes back forcefully she told AFP After seeing what I saw every day the amount of death I saw every day my tone changed she said I became more pushy even with the health minister Time is of the essence Another recent guest on Mehret is show was Dawd Siraj an Ethiopian expert on infectious diseases at the University of Wisconsin He used his two appearances to break down the science behind the virus shifting the conversation towards facts and away from what he described as supranatural narratives The foundation of science and the methods of reaching conclusions are solid I want to explain this to the public in an easy understandable way he told AFP Mehret said it is a welcome message in Ethiopia a deeply religious country where many assume God will protect them from the disease in part because there have not been many local cases so far When it comes to COVID he said people really think God will take care of it because they do not see it Like Tsion Dawd is a member of the health ministry is coronavirus task force He also serves on a diaspora advisory council established by Fitsum Arega Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is former chief of staff and Ethiopia is current ambassador in Washington The council is action plan explains how it will use experiences learned from around the world to help with everything from sourcing personal protective equipment to preparing for possible lockdowns should the situation in Ethiopia deteriorate The key is to get ahead of the virus Time is of the essence the document reads Staying vigilant Last week Mehret aired an interview with Wondwossen G Tekle an Ethiopian endovascular neurologist at the University of Texas who recently came down with and recovered from COVID19 Along with his symptoms the aches the chills the loss of taste and smell Wondwossen described the importance of prevention in keeping Ethiopia is caseload under control Though the total remains low there are now dozens of cases of community spread and officials warn that complacency could undermine containment Mehret said he hoped listeners gleaned from Wondwossen is story that this thing can catch anyone and you can recover But he also wants them to understand the importance of continued vigilance I think COVID is giving us time because maybe COVID knows we do not have enough preparation Mehret said But if we have all this time and we have done nothing and if the epidemic happens I think shame on us
